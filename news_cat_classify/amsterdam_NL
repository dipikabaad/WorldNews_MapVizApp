The area of Buiksloterham in Amsterdam is our primary case study. In these three cahiers, we present our main findings. \n\nCahier #1 introduces our Hackable City-model and explains how it can be used to explore collaborative processes of citymaking in democratic societies. What new roles have emerged for citizens, (design) professionals and institutions, and how can collectives of citizens organized issues of communal concern interact with traditional institutions? Download here >> \n\nCahier #2 describes a series of design probes that explored cooperative area development in the Amsterdam brownfield redevelopment site of Buiksloterham. These probes were tailored to investigate specific aspects of \u2018hackable citymaking\u2019: collaborative practices between different stakeholders, where new media technologies are employed to open up urban institutions and infrastructures to systemic change, in the public interest. Download here >> \n\nCahier #3 explores a series of concrete hackable citymaking practices in Athens, Sa\u0303o Paulo and Shenzhen. Despite being situated on different continents and having distinct traditions and political systems, we found a number of dynamics around civic initiatives in these cities that further informed our Hackable city model. Download here >> \n\nMore about The Hackable City \nThe goal of this research project is to explore the opportunities as well as challenges of the rise of new media technologies for an open, democratic process of collaborative citymaking. How can citizens, design professionals, local government institutions and others employ digital media platforms in collaborative processes of urban planning, management and social organization, to contribute to a liveable and resilient city, with a strong social fabric? \nHackable citymaking revolves around the organization of individuals into collectives or publics, often through or with the aid of a digital media platform. Individuals contribute resources, such as knowledge, time, information or money, and at the same time reap some form of a benefit, be it social, economic or political, on an individual or communal level. \nThese collective projects are often (though not always) initiated and managed by professionals who have started to broaden their workfields. They are no longer \u2018just\u2019 designers, but have taken up the role of community organizers, fundraisers, storytellers, project developers, etc. \nThe collectives act within legal and democratic frameworks, often making use of resources or infrastructure provided by the city at large. Hackable Citymaking makes this relationship between collectives and institutions interactive. How can the governing and administrative institutions of the city learn from the initiatives taken by these collectives, and adjust their frameworks accordingly? \nOrganization \nThe first contours for this project were laid out by One Architecture and The Mobile City during the Metropool NL workshop organized by the Deltametropool Society in 2012, resulting in the publication Eindhoven, Hackable World City. \nThis was followed by an \u2018embedded researcher\u2019 project executed by Cristina Ampatzidou, hosted at the University of Amsterdam and One Architecture and funded by the Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam, with contributions from Utrecht University. \nIn 2013 funding was received from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for a KIEM-exploration (lead by Michiel de Lange at Utrecht University). And in 2014 NWO funded this as a Creative Industries research project hosted at the University of Amsterdam, The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), and One Architecture.

Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nAt the end of 2015, artist Jeroen van Loon offered his entire DNA data \u2013 380 GB of personal data \u2013 for auction. The starting price was an extravagant 0 euro. Anyone could place a bid through www.cellout.me . A year later, the auction closed and the artist\u2019s full genome sold for 1100 euros to the Verbeke Foundation . \nThe highest bidder had just acquired an installation composed of the server cabinet where the data are stored, framed pictures documenting the DNA extracting and encoding processes, four letters written by experts as well something more difficult to fully grasp: an individual\u2019s entire DNA self-portrait. \nIn their letters, experts from very different fields attempt to untangle the meaning and implications of Cellout.me . Auction house Christie\u2019s Amsterdam seeks to estimate the artistic value of the artist\u2019s DNA; specialists at medical center ErasmusMC in Rotterdam looked at the ethical dimension of the artist\u2019s work and what it means to own his genome which they compare to the digital version of an individual. KPMG , a company with expertise \u201cin all things Big Data\u201d investigated the potential fluctuations of value of the artist\u2019s DNA through time. As for cybersecurity company Fox-It , they wrote perhaps the most dramatic note, they underline the fragility of this DNA which needs to be protected from the greed of \u2018gold miners\u2019 and other people or companies eager to speculate and profit from this new type of data. \nThe letters highlight how a project that can be summed up in a couple of words ( Artists Sells Own DNA for 1100 Euros!!! ) hides various levels of complexity, meanings, ramifications and uncomfortable questions regarding ownership, privacy, the place of DNA in big data and digital culture in general, bioethics, etc. \nThe selling of human DNA data. Artist talk by Jeroen van Loon at the Aksioma Project Space in Ljubljana on 21 March 2018 \nWhat are the consequences of owning someone else\u2019s DNA data? How does this influence the spatial privacy of the biological owner and his family members? \nThe installation is currently on view at Aksioma Project Space in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I took the exhibition as an excuse to contact Jeroen van Loon and ask him the questions above. And more: \nPhoto by Erik Borst : In front of the HiSeq DNA sequencer, which takes 2 weeks to sequence a full genome \nHi Jeroen ! The idea of selling your full genome might sound a bit abstract and too conceptual to most people. DNA is a very very long sequence of ACTGs (3 billion lines!) Could you briefly tell us about some of the ethical and cultural questions raised by the auction of your DNA data? \nThe main difference when thinking about selling DNA data (and I mean DNA data, not biological DNA) compared to other types of data \u2013 let\u2019s say credit card or social media data \u2013 is that DNA data is not constrained to one single person. DNA data is about me, but also about my sister, parents, grandparents and also my son. So when I decide to sell my DNA data, the first question one could ask is if it\u2019s even my data to sell. Who is the owner of my DNA data? Do I have any authorship or copyright concerning my DNA data? Should I inform my family members and ask for consent when doing something with my DNA data? Scientists call this characteristic of DNA data spatial privacy. Further more, if I find your DNA on a soda can and I sequence it, is it then my DNA data? \nApart from the selling questions, one of the main questions revolves around the monetary value of human DNA data. Because, how do you come up with a certain price tag for my DNA data when we discard the production price for the creation of that DNA data? What makes my DNA data any different \u2013 and more of less worthy \u2013 than yours? To make it more difficult, what we know today about human DNA data isn\u2019t the same as what we might know in let\u2019s say 15 years. The information value of human DNA data changes because of new scientific research. So linking the price tag to the current information level could also be problematic. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me, artist presentation at Aksioma Project Space.

Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nThe most distressing aspect of the work for me is that it projects you into a very uncertain future. Right now it\u2019s probably not very easy, practical nor affordable to faithfully transcribe someone else\u2019s genome and draw profit from it. But one day it might. And since you share the DNA material with your existing and future family, it means that your work might be of concern to them. Did you justify your work to them? How did they react to your project? \nYes, I explained my intentions and what I would do with my DNA data. Everybody found it interesting, some found it a little scary, including myself, and others, like my son, was, and is, too young to think anything about it. I did not ask anybody for consent, either in a formal or informal manner. You could call this egoistic, which it probably is. \nThe main reason for doing it this way is that you might otherwise not have asked this particular question. The artwork is not a metaphor, narrative or visualisation, it is a documentation of a real life action. And it is this action that creates the questions concerning this future digital culture I wanted to show. If it was not a real life action and thus without consequences, it would not have been able to ask these questions. \nThis is not to say that this does not scare me sometimes, but right now this discussion is in an \u2018ignorance is bliss\u2019 place in my mind. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : Isolating DNA from blood sample \nYou asked specialists from various fields to ponder upon the significance of the work. One of them was cybersecurity company Fox-It. In their letter , they insist on the need to protect this type data, because DNA is \u201cthe new gold\u201d and \u201caccess to the goldmine\u201d should be controlled. Yet, the description of the work states that \u201cThe artist decided not to stipulate a contract with the eventual buyer\u201d What motivated this decision? I\u2019m particularly curious about the absence of contract since it is so important   and encrypt it carefully, especially when the data is so personal. \nI came up with the idea to add a contract, which would state what the buyer could and couldn\u2019t do with the DNA data, during the final production stages of the artwork. I think I got cold feet. It was the same reason why I wanted to begin the auction price at the production price of the artwork. Both ideas were abandoned after conversations with fellow artists when I realised they would greatly damage the core idea behind the work. It would create a watered-down version of the artwork. \nWhen content becomes binary code we see the same questions pop up regarding copyright, authorship, piracy, privacy, original/copy, remix and so on. This happened to music, cinema, news, and will happen to our DNA data as well. When DNA sequence technology becomes easier, cheaper and more widely available, more companies/organisations will offer ways of e.g. sequencing, storing, sharing, owning, buying or selling DNA data. \nAs with all other types of digital content, DNA data will also be (il)legally recorded, shared, hacked, leaked, mixed and so on . My point was to show what kind of new questions could arise when human DNA data was sold, not to find the most secure way of transferring it. The actual selling asks not only these questions but also shows possible implications. \nWhat happened since you sold your DNA data? You just sent the whole installation to the Verbeke Foundation and then it disappeared from your preoccupations? \nMy focus as an artist is on visualising, documenting and revealing digital culture, not on DNA and its discourse. DNA was only my focus because it became data. So to be very honest; when the work was sold my preoccupation with my DNA data was finished. \nI try to keep up a little with news about DNA sequence possibilities. I recently saw a Dutch TV commercial in which they offered to sequence parts of your DNA for your, a sort of 23andMe.com . The fact that this is now on Dutch TV means that we will have to deal more and more with the questions surrounding data and DNA and therefor I feel happy to already have finished the work since I tried to reveal digital culture with this work. \nI did write a small text about my final reflections on the selling of my DNA data for Digimag Journal | Issue 75 | Digital Identities, Self Narratives . The interesting part was that a lot of people around me were encouraging me to place fake bids to get higher bids. Even journalists told me they would write about the work if the price would be higher. This really frustrated me, as if a work is only interesting if it\u2019s worth as much as possible. The strange thing was that during the last month of the auction I got the same feeling, \u2018the work is useless and failed if it\u2019s being sold for 500 euro\u2026\u2019 Which of course doesn\u2019t matter, it was only my own insecurities. The only thing that matter was that my DNA data was sold. For how much or little didn\u2019t matter, the selling itself was important, not the price. But it did get me thinking about what would change the price. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference in the order in which the 3 billion ACTG\u2019s are positioned, rather I think it could be a difference in context. Who sells it, when, where, how and why, meaning the value of DNA data resides in context rather than in production as perhaps is the case with all art. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me \u2013 selling human DNA data \nHave you never been worried by the fact that the work could have been bought by some private company that speculates on data? By Amazon or Google for example? \nI did, this was precisely the worry that made me think of the contract and start looking at the production price. The thing that scared me the most was that someone would buy it, analyse the sequenced data so they knew e.g. what my chances are on getting alzheimer\u2019s disease and publishing all this information so my family members could read about their own chances of getting it without having the chance to say \u2018no, I do not want to know this right now.\u2019. \nDuring the last 30 minutes of the year-long auction there where four different potential buyers of which one had a relation with the medical industry. What could have happened if Verbeke haden\u2019t bought it, I don\u2019t know, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be an artwork anymore, it would just be data. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : In ErasmusMC\u2019s data center: the hardware responsible for storing and analysing DNA \nPhoto by Erik Borst : Transferring 380gb of DNA data from ErasmusMC\u2019s data center to the artist\u2019s hard drive \nDo you think it could turn out that yours was actually a very wise move? That the Verbeke Foundation might do more to protect your DNA data than you (or anyone else) could do? That it now feels some kind of responsibility towards it? \nI never thought about it that way. Could be I guess. Since there is no contract they can do whatever they want with the work, sell it, show it, dismantle it, put it in a depot. I don\u2019t have any say in it, so when Aksioma asked me if it would be possible to show cellout.me , I first had to ask if I could loan the artwork. It would be interesting to document the opinion of Geert Verbeke , owner of the Verbeke Foundation , about his responsibility towards the artwork and the data. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : 3 vials of blood \nWas the \u2018blood-to-data\u2019 process a long and difficult one? What was it like and who did you work with? \nThe team of Andr\u00e9 Uitterlinden (Professor of Complex Genetics at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) helped me with understanding the procedure of sequencing my DNA and the actual sequencing. Through this understanding I could decide how many photos I needed to show the blood-to-data process. All photos were taken by Erik Borst , with which I discussed how the images should look. \nAfter generating a few blood samples the biological DNA was extracted from my blood. The sequencing itself took two full weeks, this was due the fact that my DNA data was sequenced in a 30-fold depth, meaning it was of laboratory quality. When the sequence was finished the data was checked by bioinformaticians, with which I discussed before hand what kind of output I needed for the artwork. The staff was extremely helpful and interested as they saw this work as an opportunity to communicate about their work and DNA in general. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me, exhibition view at Aksioma Project Space. Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nI\u2019m also curious about the aesthetics of the piece. The final installation looks like a normal server cabinet, it could host any type of data. What guided your artistic decision to showcase and communicate the process this way? Was it just the most practical option? \nOne of the most difficult tasks during the production of the work was to think of the medium in which I wanted to show the DNA data. I found it very difficult to create a visual link between the auction and the actual data. In my mind, the medium in which I wanted to show the work didn\u2019t need to be an artistic representation or imagination. The work is not a visualisation, it is a documentation. I struggled with this because I was mainly thinking about how it was going to look inside a gallery. I thought of tripods, pedestals, mounted screens, framed harddisks, printed DNA code and so on, all terrible. \nThe night before I had to finished my proposal, I got the idea of using a server cabinet (don\u2019t remember how I got the idea), I found it the most honest way of documenting the auction and the data since I could use a screen for each. Showing the actual raw data file on one screen and the realtime auction results through the website www.cellout.me on another, all inside the same object. The tall blackish server cabinet itself is beautiful; it\u2019s nearly the same size as me, the glass door reflects you when your looking at the data, it\u2019s an object that people know, they relate it to data, datacenters, google, facebook and so on. It\u2019s a closed cabinet with the data inside as if it\u2019s an box waiting to be opened. It was the perfect medium to communicate my thoughts, and indeed a very practical one. \nWhat are you showing at Aksioma exactly? The full installation? Other materials? \nI\u2019m showing, with the help of the Verbeke Foundation, the full installation. The presentation consists of the server cabinet, the blood-to-data photo series and the four texts written by Christie\u2019s, ErasmusMC, KPMG and Fox-IT \u2013 which have an English translation that the audience can take home. \nThanks Jeroen ! \nCellout.me , Jeroen van Loon\u2019s solo show is at Aksioma in Ljubljana from 21 March until 20 April 2018.

Na twee optredens in Zuid-Afrika gaat vanavond het eerste concert van zijn Europese tour van start. In een uitverkochte Melkweg Max in Amsterdam zet Myles een show neer waarin hij nummers speelt van onder andere zijn soloalbum, Alter Bridge, Mayfield Four en Slash. \nDe agenda's van Alter Bridge en Slash zijn de afgelopen jaren goed op elkaar afgestemd. Als Slash op tournee is, blijft Alter Bridge thuis en dat geldt ook andersom. Nu Slash weer op het podium staat met zijn Guns n' Roses-'maatje' Axl en daarmee in korte tijd het begrotingstekort van de Nederlandse overheid verdient, is er ruimte ontstaan in de de agenda van Myles Kennedy. Daardoor kan Myles eindelijk zijn al jaren geplande soloalbum uitbrengen. Een album waarop de 'verlegen' zanger het verhaal vertelt van zijn overleden vader en de invloed die het heeft op zijn leven. \nDe avond wordt geopend door de Utrechter Jasper Mook . Jasper stond een aantal jaar geleden in de finale van het televisieprogramma De Beste Singer Songwriter Van Nederland . De muziek van Jasper ligt niet helemaal in lijn met die van Myles. Zijn repertoire is meer gericht op pop dan op rock. Het is hard werken voor Jasper om het publiek enigszins op zijn hand te krijgen. Aan zijn inzet en enthousiasme ligt het niet en op zijn nummers en zang is eigenlijk niets aan te merken. Echter, het moet wel je smaak zijn. Persoonlijk heb ik er niet zoveel mee en gezien de lauwe reacties van het publiek, ben ik blijkbaar niet de enige. \nNa het ombouwen van het podium (wat in dit geval niet meer is dan het uitpluggen van de gitaren van het voorprogramma, het krukje voor Myles op de juiste plaats zetten en het aansteken van de vier kaarsen) is het tijd voor Myles Kennedy om zijn soloshow te starten. Alleen op een podium, zonder ondersteuning van een band. \nBeperkt licht gaat aan, Devil On The Wall begint. Myles komt al gitaarspelend het podium op en wordt met open armen ontvangen door het publiek. De sfeer zit er vanaf de eerste noot al in. Vervolgens gaat Standing In The Sun van start met wat technische probleempjes doordat Myles zijn voetpedaal niet in de juiste stand heeft staan, wat gelukkig snel verholpen kan worden. Als hij daarna vervolgens van gitaar wisselt en al begint te spelen zonder dat de plug van de versterker er al in zit, schiet hij in de lach. De spanning valt van hem af. Als vervolgens Before Tomorrow Comes start, gaat het publiek helemaal los. \nTussen de songs door neemt de zanger alle tijd om verhalen, ervaringen en grapjes te vertellen. De reacties van het publiek toveren de hele avond een grote grijns op zijn gezicht. Van de 'verlegen' Myles is niet veel meer te zien. Zo vertelt hij bewust gekozen te hebben om de show sober te houden, want hij wil de muziek voor zich laten spreken. En dat lukt! De semi-akoestische muziek in combinatie met de karakteristieke, perfecte zanglijnen en de stem van Myles levert geregeld kippenvelmomenten op. \nVerrassend is het Led Zeppelin-nummer Going To California , waarbij je je afvraagt of de inspiratie hiervoor is ontstaan toen Myles betrokken was bij een Led Zeppelin-re\ufffdnie zonder Robert Plant. Ook Traveling Riverside Blues van de grondlegger van de blues - Robert Johnson - is opvallend te noemen. Dat het optreden echt live is, blijkt wel uit het feit dat Myles de songlist op het podium gewoon aanpast naar wat voor hem goed voelt of wat er uit het publiek wordt gevraagd. Niets geen bandjes of ondersteuning die meelopen. \nDe Alter Bridge-fans komen ruimschoots aan bod want er staan zeven songs op de setlist. Na het drieluik Wonderful Life, Watch Over You en Open Your Eyes is het tijd voor de toegift die bestaat uit de covers Levon van Elton John en het gevoelige Hallelujah van Leonard Cohen. Voor de laatste keer krijgt Kennedy van het publiek een uitzinnig applaus waarbij hij letterlijk alle credits verdient voor deze kwalitatief hoge performance. Solo op het podium met af en toe ondersteuning van tourmanager Tim Tournier, wanneer dit nodig is voor de muziek. Het enige dat achteraf opvalt aan deze avond is dat er maar vier nummers van zijn persoonlijke soloalbum op de setlist staan. \nWie verwacht had dat de serieuze teksten van Myles zijn Year Of The Tiger -album ook de stemming van het optreden zouden bepalen heeft het mis. Wat een magische en energieke show is er neergezet door Myles Kennedy. \nSetlist: 1. Devil On The Wall 2. Standing In The Sun (Slash & The Conspirators-cover) 3.
