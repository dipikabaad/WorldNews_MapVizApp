Print version The Latvian Consumer Rights Protection Center (PTAC) has imposed an EUR 18,700 fine on Sugar Media concert organizer owner by an Estonian businessman, PTAC reported LETA. \nPTAC informed that in the time period from July 2017 until October 2017 the European Consumers Information Center and PTAC received 15 complaints about two-day festival Retro Beach Fest 2017 in Lithuanian city Zarasai and Egor Kreed \u2019s concert in Dzintari concert hall in Jurmala, Latvia, both organized by Sugar Media . \nPTAC discovered that during the Retro Beach Fest 2017, the performing artists were not those as promised by the organizer, and the organizer had not reduced the ticket price or refunded tickets after receiving complaints from customers. PTAC thus concludes that the company not only has failed to comply with the service agreement, but has deceived consumers, providing false information on artists performing at the festival. \nIn total, 5,000 tickets were sold to the festival, the prices ranged from EUR 18 to EUR 29, and the estimated loss is at least EUR 90,000. \nEgor Kreed\u2019s concert planned on August 8 was cancelled, and only a part of consumers got their tickets refunded because Sugar Media had not transferred all the necessary funds to Bilesu Service ticket office. Thus, 61 tickets for a total sum of EUR 3,055 were not refunded. \nPTAC has tried to contact Sugar Media several times, demanding to stop the unfair commercial practice and provide all the necessary information, but the company did not cooperate and did not settle the problems. \nPTAC thus concluded that Sugar Media \u2019s commercial practice is unfair and deceiving, and decided to fine the company with EUR 18,700. \nAccording to Firmas.lv business database, Sugar Media was registered in Latvia in May 2016. Its share capital is EUR 2,800, and the company belongs to an Estonian citizen. \nThe company closed 2016 with EUR 187,003 in turnover and EUR 742 in profit. According to the State Revenue Service data, on March 7, Sugar Media had a tax debt of EUR 14,920, and the company\u2019s value added tax (VAT) certificate has been annulled.

Print version The Latvian parliament today passed in the final reading amendments to the Education Law and the Law on General Education under which schools of ethnic minorities will have to start gradual transition to Latvian-only secondary education in the 2019/2020 academic year, reports LETA. \nThe 100-member parliament passed the bills with 58 votes for and 13 votes against. \nEducation and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity) proposed the education reform in early October 2017, which caused yet another wave of protests from Latvia's Russian-speaking community. \nPrime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) stressed the education reform had to be adopted quickly so that the question would not be used in the election campaigns ahead of the general elections planned in early October this year. \nThe government approved the proposed legislative amendments in late January 2018, and the parliament started discussing the bills at the beginning of January. The lawmakers also turned down the petition calling for preserving bilingual education in Latvia that was signed by over 10,000 Latvian citizens. \nDespite numerous proposals to alter the education reform in the ethnic minority school or to scrap it altogether, the bills submitted to the parliament for the third and final reading are practically the same as approved by the government earlier. The legislative amendments providing for a gradual transition to education in Latvian in all public schools will be implemented gradually from September 1, 2019, to September 1, 2021. \nAlready in preschools, starting from the age of five, new education guidelines will be introduced in 2019/2020 school year, providing for a bigger role of the Latvian language in the study process. \nA new bilingual education model will be introduced in grades 1-6, ensuring that at least 50% of the subjects are taught in Latvian, and in grades 7-9, ensuring that at least 80% of the study contents is in Latvian in 2019/2020. The final exams for the 9th grade pupils will be held entirely in Latvia. \nStarting from 2020/2021 school year all general education subjects in grades 10 and 11 will be taught only in the Latvian language, while children of ethnic minorities will continue learning their native language, literature and subjects related to culture and history in the respective minority language. \nStarting from 2021/2022 school year all general education subjects in high school (grades 10-12) will be taught only in the Latvian language, while children of ethnic minorities will continue learning their native language, literature and subjects related to culture and history in the respective minority language.
