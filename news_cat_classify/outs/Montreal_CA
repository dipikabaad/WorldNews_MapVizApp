My colleagues are innocent, my son, all these kids are innocent.\"\nBodil Geyer, who organized the march in Vancouver, said hundreds of people showed up despite a fake Facebook event showing the wrong time.\n\"We had a great turnout, all things considered,\" she said.\nGeyer said the real event page was also peppered with pro-gun comments she believed were generated by bots or international users, because the grammar was often incorrect and some messages were threatening.\nWhile the march was largely a show of support for the American gun control movement, Geyer said gang violence in Surrey also makes it a local issue.\nAll of the speakers at the Vancouver event were students, said Geyer, who represents both Democrats Abroad Vancouver and March On Vancouver.\n\"The crowd was amazing, they were awe-inspired, everyone was quite emotional listening to these kids,\" she said.\nTens of thousands of people were expected to attend the march in Washington, D.C., with smaller gatherings to take place in hundreds of cities across the world.\nRallies were also planned in most major Canadian cities, including St. John's, Ottawa and Calgary.\nMelissa Hennig, a survivor of the Oct. 1 mass shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, joined about 150 people for a rally outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton.\n\"While I don't know the ins and outs of assault rifles, I can tell you what it's like to be on the other end of one,\" the Edmonton-area woman told the crowd. She said it's difficult to talk about the \"terror, confusion and panic.\n\"I can tell you something more needs to be done -- something more than thoughts and prayers.\"\nWith files from Ben Singer and Nicole Thompson in Toronto, Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton and Amy Smart in Vancouver \nHundreds out for Ottawa's March for Our Lives rally @ctvottawa pic.twitter.com/dJwlTbUAp0 \n\u2014 Annie BergeronOliver (@AnnieClaireBO) March 24, 2018 McGill student Cyril Yared graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland FL.

When Belisle answered in the negative, Jean Gilles responded that the crime for which he was charged was municipal-related.\nThe four-year term will begin once Jean Gilles' current sentence for assaulting a police officer expires. He is eligible for parole in July in that case.\nBelisle said the dog attack was not a \"one-off incident but rather part of repeated behaviour that has been going on for years.\"\n\"The table was set for a tragedy,\" the judge said. \"The problem wasn't so much if the tragedy would occur but rather when it would happen.\"\nThe conviction carried a maximum 10-year prison term.\nMagdalena Biron said during the trial the attack in a park left her daughter Vanessa with fractures to the cranium and hand, as well as a cheekbone broken in seven places. She still has scars on her face.\nHer partner, Bernard Biron, said at the time Vanessa did not bear any grudges, even though the attack left her unable to eat solid food for months.\n\"She had to go to school with a device connected to her veins because her brain was infected,\" he said. \"Because her skull was crushed in the back and the saliva of the dog infected her system.\"\nIn a brief statement on the last day of his trial, Jean Gilles suggested to Belisle his animal might have been provoked.\nThe judge rejected the claim.\nThe dogs -- another of Jean Gilles' dogs was also at the park that day -- weren't wearing collars the day of the attack and were not on a leash, Belisle said. The accused's property was not adequately fenced in and he didn't have the ability to subdue the animals, the judge added.\nRelated Stories Accused at Quebec pit bull trial tells the court he won't testify Owner of pit bull-type dog found guilty Photos Magdalena Biron and Bernard Biron, whose daughter Vanessa was severely mauled by a pit bull-type dog, leave the courtroom in Longueuil, Que., on Feb. 20, 2018.

Another 14 people were injured in the massacre, including Nathalie Provost, who sustained four gunshot wounds, including one to the forehead.\nOn Saturday, Provost joined hundreds of thousands of others in Washington D.C. for the March for Our Lives rally against gun violence.\n\u201cI had the feeling that it may be a historic moment,\u201d Provost said in a telephone interview with CTV News Channel on Saturday.\n\u201cIt was amazing because they believe in what they say and they are strong and courageous,\u201d she added, speaking of her fellow demonstrators, many of whom are demanding stricter gun-control laws in the U.S.\n\u201cThey have a very, very extraordinary determination to change the world and they believe they can do it.\u201d\nThe growing momentum behind the U.S. gun control movement should offer lessons to Canada, Provost said. For example, the Ruger Mini-14 -- the semi-automatic rifle used in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre -- is still classified as a \u201cnon-restricted firearm\u201d in Canada, despite resembling an assault rifle.\n\u201cThe Liberals and all the politicians in Canada must have political courage to change our laws, and they are not strong enough now,\u201d Provost said. \u201cI think that even if we\u2019re not talking about the long gun registry, we can improve other things. We don\u2019t have any strong laws banning assault weapons.\u201d\nSuch weapons, Provost argues, should be banned altogether -- something protesters were also demanding in Washington.\n\u201cWe must show our support clearly to those kids in the United States,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if they do something before us, shame on us.\u201d\nProvost says she was also heartened to meet fellow survivors at the march.\n\u201cThey want things to change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe \u2018never again\u2019 shout is very, very strong here.\u201d\nRelated Stories 'I will vote you out': Teens vow to shake up U.S. politics at gun control rallies Canadian cities hold March for our Lives events Jennifer Hudson, Paul McCartney join students' gun-reform rallies 'I have a dream that enough is enough': Americans march for gun control Gun control rally begins where the movement was sparked Photos Nathalie Provost poses for a photograph following a news conference at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, Friday, November 28, 2014.
