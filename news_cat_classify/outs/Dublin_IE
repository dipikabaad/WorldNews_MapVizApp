Image: RollingNews.ie \nA 36-YEAR-OLD man told gardai he was \u201cabsolutely not guilty\u201d when he was charged today with the murder of Vincent Ryan during a shooting in Dublin in 2016. \nJeffrey Morrow from Burnell Court, Malahide Road, Dublin 17, was arrested this afternoon at Dublin Airport after he was extradited from the UK. He was taken to a garda station where he was charged with the murder of Vincent Ryan at McKee Road, Finglas, Dublin on 29 February 2016. \nRyan, a 25-year-old father, was gunned down while sitting in his car. \nMr Morrow is the second person to be charged over the fatal shooting. \nOn 12 March, Paul O\u2019Beirne, 35, with an address at Colepark Drive, Ballyfermot, Dublin, was also charged with his murder and was remanded in custody. \nDressed in a grey tracksuit and black runners, Mr Morrow was brought to appear before Judge Michael Walsh at Dublin District Court this afternoon. \nDet Sergeant Alan Brady told the court he arrested the 36-year-old at the airport at 12.18pm on foot of an arrest warrant. When he was charged at Finglas Garda station Mr Morrow replied, \u201cabsolutely not guilty\u201d, said Det Sergeant Brady. \nJudge Walsh said due to the nature of the charge there was no application for bail. He remanded Mr Morrow, who did not address the court, in custody. \nHe will face his next hearing on 27 March at Cloverhill District Court. \nBail in murder cases can only be granted in the High Court. \nDefence solicitor Stephanie O\u2019Meara made an application for legal aid and told the court her client was \u201cnot working and not in receipt of income having come in on foot of a European Arrest Warrant\u201d. \nNoting there was no Garda objection, Judge Walsh granted legal aid. \nAt co-accused Mr O\u2019Beirne\u2019s hearing on 12 March, evidence of arrest, charge and caution was given by Det Sergeant Gavin Ross of Finglas station who told the court that accused was arrested earlier that day at his home address at 2.36pm on foot of a warrant issued by the district court. \nDet Sergeant Ross had said Mr O\u2019Beirne was taken to Ballyfermot Garda station where he was charged. \nThe court heard he was handed a copy of the charge and in reply after caution said: \u201cNothing got to do with me at all.\u201d \nDet Sergeant Ross confirmed the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that Mr O\u2019Beirne was to face trial on indictment in the Central Criminal Court.

Had he been fit, I think we may have made it, who knows. \nHe would have given us a much better opportunity. \nI've said to him, and I'd rather say it when hes not in the room, he's an absolutely world class player. Advertisement \nWorld class or not, it is curious what O'Neill's overt praise of Coleman means for his able replacement Cyrus Christie. \nRecently awarded Ireland's Young Player of the Year during a weekend ceremony, although it was certainly not O'Neill's intention, his Coleman comments will inevitably lead to questions regarding Christie's future involvement in the squad. \nAt 29-years-old, O'Neill's comments would suggest that Coleman - injuries notwithstanding - will be in possession of that right full-back position for the foreseeable future. Having made such a tremendous recovery, seamlessly slipping back into Everton's side, his fitness and physical preparation will stand him in good stead. \nFour years his junior and having recently joined promotion-hunting Fulham, Christie will unquestionably be keen to hold onto his place in the side. Given O'Neill's comments however, he may have to settle for a prolonged spell on the sidelines.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cyrus christie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arthur james o'dea", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seamus coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin o'neill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aviva stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donegal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:22:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b84acd7f6817ccde397b8da9056aab6e1738b910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mF5HXnAwAm88Fk1nFYD6_id8WbUQtrqrDB5706YSba2K4tu2yQdnj", "site_full": "www.hotpress.com", "site": "hotpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.hotpress.com/rss/rss.php", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "hotpress.com - Latest", "title": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "title_full": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hotpress.com//store/images/adm/21/21860/21860612_PC_TM.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b84acd7f6817ccde397b8da9056aab6e1738b910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mF5HXnAwAm88Fk1nFYD6_id8WbUQtrqrDB5706YSba2K4tu2yQdnj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "text": "Read More The Gloaming will release Live At NCH album ahead of concerts this March \nThe Gloaming will play seven sold-out shows at Dublin\u2019s National Concert Hall, from March 5-12, their only live appearances of 2018.

I didn\u2019t realise these types of school drills were largely unique to America until I moved abroad. \n\u201cI want to help build an America where these kinds of drills don\u2019t need to happen anymore.\u201d \nJohnson said he would like the marches around the world to remind Americans that \u201croutine mass shootings just don\u2019t happen outside of the US\u201d. He is calling on elected officials to work across the aisle to protect people from gun violence. \nOslo \n(Sandi Salus/PA) \nActivist and scientist Sandi Salus, 45, helped to bring the Oslo rally together. This wasn\u2019t her first foray into the world of protest \u2013 she has helped to organise Women\u2019s March Norway 2017 and 2018 and the March for Science Norway 2017. \n\u201cI ended up meeting a few other American expats here during the first Women\u2019s March and one of them had started up an organisation called PAAL (Progressive American\u2019s Action League) here in Oslo with the intent of fighting against social, racial, and environmental injustice happening back home in the US but also locally in Oslo,\u201d Salus explained. \n\u201cI got burnt out a bit after this last Women\u2019s March but the Parkland shooting just really hit hard. I had already had a hard time looking to the US from Norway and seeing all of this gun violence occurring year after year with nothing being done about it.\u201d \n(Sandi Salus/PA) \nWhen the Parkland students announced the March 24 event, Salus felt ready to throw herself into organising again, to show the students they had international support, and show lawmakers in the US that expats were watching. \n\u201cI also think that it is important that we share our perspective \u2013 that we have had the chance to live outside the US and see how another place deals with gun reform.\u201d \nAt Saturday\u2019s rally, attendees lit candles and Salus gave a speech \u2013 then the floor was opened to others who had points to make. \n\u201cOne young woman, an American, told of how her life has been touched by gun violence, including knowing gun victims as well as teaching young students in San Antonio, Texas and having to keep them calm and ease the students\u2019 fears as they had to undergo gun-violence drills,\u201d said Salus. \u201cIt was very moving.\u201d \nAlso in attendance was a survivor of the Ut\u00f8ya attack in 2011, when a gunman killed 69 young people attending a summer camp. According to Salus, \u201che has now committed his life to gun safety as well as helping with the mental health issues of those who have gone through a horrible incident of gun violence\u201d. \nMumbai #MarchForOurLives Tanushka (@_tanushka13) March 24, 2018 \n\u2019s protest will be held on Sunday March 25 and 17-year-old student and writer Mahek Chacha is planning to attend. \n\u201cAs an Indian, it is thankfully a far-fetched thought for an adolescent to purchase a gun and terrorise the lives of countless people, whatever the reason may be,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWatching such events unfold as an outsider, as someone who is not American, the cause and prevention of mass shootings is painfully obvious to me. \n\u201cRaising the age for gun licences, thorough background checks for potential gun owners, better security in public places, especially schools, are just some of the ways to easily prevent gun violence, yet at the hands of gun owners and the NRA itself, no such action has been taken.\u201d \nChacha says that as a student herself, she finds the idea of students fearing gun violence at school to be \u201cincredibly painful\u201d. Although she cannot relate to that feeling, she is joining the protest to support American teens in their quest for gun reform. \nBarcelona \n(Rebecca Gonzalez/PA) \n\u201cI am inspired by young leaders like Florida students who instead of staying home being afraid, overcame the fear and stood up for their rights,\u201d said Rebecca Gonzalez, 21, a political science student who attended a rainy rally in Barcelona\u2019s Placa Catalunya. \n\u201cI truly admire them so I want to stand up with them as a young student in solidarity.\u201d \nDespite the rain, more that 75 people attended the rally, during which speeches were given and 17 pairs of shoes laid out in a circle to represent those who were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. \n(Rebecca Gonzalez/PA) \nJessica Craig, 44, who organised the small gathering, said: \u201cThis was the first time I organised a demonstration around such an intense and painful issue. \n\u201cSome of the stories other women shared were so much more emotional than I was expecting. \n\u201cIt makes you realise the insanely large number of people who are impacted by gun violence when even a small demonstration so far away from the US ends up including people who have had a direct experience of a mass shooting or people who live each day worrying about this.\u201d \nMelbourne The rain didn\u2019t stop us! persephone nihil (@IDidThisMyself) March 24, 2018 \nYoung activist Persephone Nihil took it upon herself to organise Melbourne\u2019s March For Our Lives with a friend, inspired by the actions of Florida\u2019s Parkland students. \n\u201cNot only has America been standing by and ignoring their gun problem, so has the rest of the world,\u201d the 16-year-old said. \nNihil would like the outcome of the global marches to be \u201ca reflection on the consistent weakening of gun laws internationally, and the lack of gun laws in America, and finally seeing some change in gun laws and the deadly culture surrounding them\u201d. \nLondon \n(Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nIn the UK, concerned activists headed to Edinburgh and London to stand with students in the US. \nStephen James Rushbrook, 47, travelled from the Isle of Wight especially to add his voice to the hundreds of children and adults outside the US Embassy in Nine Elms. \nThe computer game artist said he took part in the rally \u201cbecause I believe the way the USA proudly treats its guns and the current, distorted reading of the second amendment as a fetish is sick and perverse\u201d. \n(Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nRushbrook said he has done his own research on shootings in the US and felt he had to support the building opposition against the NRA, gun lobby and the gun manufacturing industry. \n\u201cI am sensitive that a certain percentage of the USA will tell us to mind our own bloody business, but it is important that the industrialised world shows solidarity with the US\u2026 We\u2019ve all gone through this and made the choice that individual liberty to own guns is outweighed but the need to protect the most vulnerable in out community, our children.\u201d \nTokyo Reminder, if you are in Tokyo and wish to support the #NeverAgain movement, there will be a @AMarch4OurLives event tonight at the Hachiko statue in Shibuya at 5PM. \u2014 Kat Callahan (\u9b8e\u5ddd\u304d\u304a) (@JezebelKat) March 24, 2018 \nKat Callahan, 34, who was at high school when the Columbine shooting occurred and now lives in Japan, said the US is no different from other nations that have implemented gun control, there is just a lack of political will to do so. \nThe writer and teacher joined American expats and Japanese citizens in Hachiko Square in Tokyo. Attendees held signs bearing the names of victims of various school shootings in the US. \nCallahan feels teenagers are not taken seriously by adults when raising important issues about their welfare. Today, I joined the #MarchForOurLives in Tokyo pic.twitter.com/Z3P0vapkgg \u2014 \u265bRica (@luthorscanary) March 24, 2018 \nShe said: \u201cWhile many are finally listening to the students of Parkland, they are not unique. This is not to suggest they are any less amazing than they are, but it is to highlight the number of teens over the last 20 years that have tried to raise awareness only to be shut down, ignored, shouted over, and sidelined. \n\u201cRelatively recently black teens and other teens of colour have led their own protests to gun violence, including police violence, which has to be part of the conversation, and have not been given the same attention as the Parkland students, despite being just as active, passionate, and hard-working. \n\u201cI\u2019m really glad people are listening to the Parkland students, and teens more generally, but I gotta ask, where the hell have you been for the last 20 years?\u201d \nCallahan has been touched personally by gun violence. \n\u201cWhen I was in high school, my school bully and I got into a fight. He went home, grabbed his abusive father\u2019s gun, and while there was a raging debate inside his own head (from what we can glean from the note), he decided not to become a school shooter,\u201d she said. \n\u201cInstead he shot himself in the head. \n\u201cI consider him a victim of the same easy access to guns as any others.
