In Washington, volunteers for the HeadCount voter-registration effort raised their fists and chanted \u201cdemonstration without registration leads to frustration\u201d before heading out with clipboards to sign up some of the nation\u2019s newest voters. \u201cParkland\u2019s Emma Gonzalez called for more Americans to vote and that is why Headcount is here today,\u201d volunteer Aaron Ghitelman, 26, said of the student who along with classmates forged a national, youth gun control movement following the Feb. 14 massacre at her high school in Parkland, Florida. Hugh Williams from Ypsilanti, Michigan, was among many 18-year-olds who answered her call. \u201cThe more I see people marching and standing up for a cause I believe in, I want my voice to matter, too,\u201d he said at the Washington march, adding that gun violence was a menace in his community. A student survivor of the Parkland massacre had a simple message for lawmakers. \u201cIf there is no assault weapons ban passed, then we will vote them out,\u201d Delaney Tarr, a senior at the school, told marchers in Washington. Organizers of the registration drive hoped to sign up at least 25,000 people on Saturday, a potential boost for Democrats who back stronger controls on assault-style weapons, bump stocks that let semiautomatic rifles fire like automatic weapons, and tighter access to guns for young people and the mentally ill.

Ford aircraft carrier. President Trump on Friday moved to formally ban most transgender people from serving in the military, with limited exceptions.\nThe White House issued a memorandum on policies determined by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, stating that transgender people are \"disqualified from military service except under limited circumstances.\"\nThe memorandum, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, states that \"transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.\"\nMattis will have some leeway in implementing the policy, the memo states, as will Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen when it comes to the Coast Guard. The pair \"may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals,\" the memo reads.\nLGBT advocates quickly denounced the move.\n\"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin said in a statement.\n\"Donald Trump and Mike Pence are pushing their extreme anti-transgender prejudices onto the military over the overwhelming objections of bipartisan officials, national security leaders and the American public,\" Griffin added.\n\"The Trump-Pence administration's continued insistence on targeting our military families for discrimination is appalling, reckless, and unpatriotic,\" added American Military Partner Association president Ashley Broadway-Mack.\nThe Palm Center, a group that promotes the study of LGBT people in the military, accused the Pentagon of having \"distorted the science on transgender health to prop up irrational and legally untenable discrimination that will erode military readiness.\"\n\"There is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy. Our troops and our nation deserve better,\" the group said.\nTrump first called for a ban on transgender troops in a series of tweets last summer, and followed up in August by issuing a memo banning transgender people from enlisting.\nThe ban has since been battled over in court, with Mattis in February giving Trump a final recommendation . It was expected that he would recommend Trump allow transgender troops to remain in the military.\nA Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on Mattis's recommendation in February, only confirming that the Defense chief had advised the president on the subject.\nSeveral federal courts blocked Trump's initial ban, with one ruling in November that the military would be forced to resume accepting transgender recruits starting this year.\nIn February, the Pentagon confirmed that one transgender recruit had joined a branch of the military after the ban was lifted due to the court order. That individual passed all tests including medical, officials said.\nIt's unclear what Trump's decision will mean for that unnamed recruit and the estimated thousands of other transgender Americans currently serving active duty in the military.\nWhile the exact number of transgender individuals in active duty service is unknown, a 2016 Rand Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon estimated the number to be anywhere from 1,320 and 6,630, with 830 to 4,160 others serving in the reserves.\nUpdated: 9:45 p.m.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/policy/defense/375151-mattis-expected-to-recommend-trump-allow-transgender-troops-stay-in-the", "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/375311-pentagon-mattis-has-given-trump-transgender-troops-advice", "https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9909.html", "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/375626-first-transgender-recruit-signs-contract-to-join-military", "http://www.thehill.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "avery anapol", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gerald r. ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "newport news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "langley air force base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T06:29:45.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d73e82e4113d81e3702a410d8cec4425aabd63b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VXqDNDj7TRxg_bdQk1tCOuNiP6MbCdCVAQMn9PHafiZKBNC.nIhOTWIqQpNJt4uWYkxRqkOBXBT28I4_iSELuI3fzcuUf.hkY-", "site_full": "komonews.com", "site": "komonews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Man rents fancy McLaren, then crashes it on I-5 | KATU", "title_full": "Man rents fancy McLaren, then crashes it on I-5 | KATU", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.222, "main_image": "http://static-10.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/a39aad8a-af81-4ee8-9947-5f5f7d138676-large16x9_blue.JPG?1521753949096", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 7443, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1230, "comments": 1, "shares": 1230}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d73e82e4113d81e3702a410d8cec4425aabd63b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VXqDNDj7TRxg_bdQk1tCOuNiP6MbCdCVAQMn9PHafiZKBNC.nIhOTWIqQpNJt4uWYkxRqkOBXBT28I4_iSELuI3fzcuUf.hkY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Komo Staff", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Man rents fancy McLaren, then crashes it on I-5 | KATU", "text": "Man rents fancy McLaren, then crashes it on I-5 KOMO Staff Published 10:12 pm, Thursday, March 22, 2018 Photo: KOMO News \nPhoto: Washington State Patrol \nIt was a four-hour rental.

(You can see all the eligible entries so far on the Tiny Desk Contest site , too.) \nWhile preparing your last-minute entry \u2014 totally fine, by the way \u2014 check out these entries below to see what we on the other side have been marking (stick around until the end for an important tip on entering, too). \nScorpio and the Hunter, \"Seven Sisters\" YouTube \nScorpio and the Hunter has a deep understanding of its sound, which made \"Seven Sisters\" a treat to listen to. The band describes itself as \"a Seattle based neo-soul group,\" whose music \"explores their identities as queer people and people of color through allusion to mythology, astrology, and religion.\" The group's cosmic poesy is profoundly effective, and the more I listened, the more I enchanted I became. The members play with an ease that wraps itself around the song like a cozy blanket of stars. The finger-picked guitar coming out of the first chorus and in the bridge twinkled like a constellation and was an especially nice touch. If you've ever wanted to know what it feels like to sip a cocktail in space, this song will get you there. \u2014 Pilar Fitzgerald \nErin Lunsford, \"Don't Leave Me In The Dark\" YouTube \nErin Lunsford is a singer-songwriter from Virginia who releases music both on her own and as the frontwoman of Charlottesville-based band Erin & The Wildfire. Her Tiny Desk Contest entry, \"Don't Leave Me in the Dark,\" starts off with a charming blooper \u2013 but don't let the goofiness fool you. The song is a tale of heartbreak and missed connection that shows off her impressive, expressive voice and some serious guitar chops. \u2014 Marissa Lorusso \nAviva Lipkowitz, \"Lovesick\" YouTube \nThe door to Aviva Lipkowitz's 2004 Toyota Siena slides open with a click, revealing a small desk adorned with fresh magenta flowers, a pale acoustic guitar and a neatly tucked bed. Everything about her entry \u2014 the song (which seems to sink into your muscle fibers), the setting (a vehicle that she's made her home for the past year) and the videography (that shakey, home-video intimacy) \u2014 is steeped in a profound delicacy. Two minutes in, the title of the song is finally uttered, and oh: The weight of it just sits on your chest. \"Lovesick\" is the kind of quiet acoustic ballad that can stop time for a few minutes and leaves you dizzy with nostalgia when the music stops. \u2014 Cyrena Touros \nNiambi Ra & The Blackstarz, \"C2B\" YouTube \n\"C2B\" is a delightful spiritual-celestial burst of energy from start to finish. MC Keziah \"Niambi Ra\" John-Paul sits front and center, spitting charisma and consciousness like a prophet. A recent graduate of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Niambi cites Jill Scott, Common and Erykah Badu on her list of musical influences, and there are nods to them in her vocal power and lyricism. She and Nichole \"Coax Marie\" Turner unite to ignite a rowdy (and not to mention incredibly catchy) hook that will have you \"automatic body rocking.\" If you didn't already know about Niambi Ra and The Blackstarz, learn. \u2014 Pilar Fitzgerald \nJulie Odell, \"St. Fin Barre\" YouTube \nNew Orleans-based musician Julie Odell sings with a distinct, smoky-yet-childlike voice in her Tiny Desk Contest entry, \"St. Fin Barre.\" Accompanied by Kenny Murphy on bass and Jonathan Arceneaux on drums, she sings a song of grit, loss and perseverance. \"I've had too many precious things just wash away,\" she hollers towards the song's end with a ferocious beauty, \"and it all got better when I changed my name.\" \u2014 Marissa Lorusso \nIvory Circle, \"Never Let Me Go\" YouTube \nI must confess: I'm a little slow, and originally thought this was the biggest band we've seen enter the contest so far. Turns out, Ivory Circle was just making use of some editing magic. \nNow, if you're still hoping to enter the Contest before it closes Sunday at 11:59 p.m. EST, I am here to reassure you that artists will be judged based on the quality of their song, not their video. But cool videos are highly encouraged regardless! I'm duly impressed by the ambition of this concept (outfit changes and all!) and the hours of shooting and editing required to pull it off. Oh, and the song? \"Never Let Me Go\" is a perfect, upbeat pop tune with a soaring chorus that would fit nicely on my Positive Friday Morning Feels playlist.

But when students around the nation took to the streets for the March For Our Lives, Gilliam made sure she was there with them.\nWith the help of her former art teacher Kate DeCiccio, Gilliam transformed her traumatic experience into a poster, one in a series that was distributed to students for the weekend event. \"Help me save lives,\" it says. \"Gun violence almost took mine.\" \"It's one thing to create a visual with powerful words to reach the people, but it's also one thing to be featured in the poster telling your story visually,\" Gilliam told CNN. \"I wanted people to actually see what gun violence has done to my family and I.\" The posters were curated by Amplifier , a design lab based in Seattle that fuses art and activism. The organization gave away more than 40,000 posters nationwide for participants to carry as they marched   Read More \"While the battle for gun reform has been going on for years, especially within black and brown communities most affected by gun violence, we have never seen this level of national energy around gun reform,\" Program Director Cleo Barnett told CNN. \"We knew that this was the moment for real change and we wanted to support the people on the ground pushing for policy change.\" Artist Laci Jordan worked with students from Get Lit, an organization that teaches poetry, to come up with this image. Amplifier designated seven cities around the country where protesters could pick up posters. They were also free to download on their website. All of the artwork focus on the experiences of young people who have been negatively impacted by firearms, like Gilliam. On November 30, 2015, she was hit by a stray bullet while at a gas station near her apartment in Charlotte, North Carolina. Gilliam was in the process of transferring to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to pursue a degree in pediatrics at the time. Her injury forced her to halt her studies, she said. Grossmont College student Koy Suntichotinun submitted this piece during Amplifier's youth open call. Many of the designs were submitted by students themselves during an open call held by Amplifier in early March. DeCiccio believes that conveying these messages from a subjective point-of-view allows people to empathize more than they would from reading statistics. One piece paid tribute to the black youth movements that began protesting shootings years ago.
