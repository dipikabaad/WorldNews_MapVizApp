Mixed precipitations of rain and snow and ice are expected in eastern Dobrogea.\nTemperatures below zero degrees Celsius are expected throughout the country until next week.

Romania lost the province in June 1940, however, when it was occupied by the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Army. Bessarabia is now part of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe former president Traian Basescu is one of the most vocals supporters of the idea of a union between Romania and Moldova. For example, in mid-January this year, he said the Romanian government should establish a \u201ccountry reunification ministry , adding that he would initiate in the coming parliamentary session a document through which the Parliament expressed its wish to reunite the country with the Republic of Moldova.\nAlso, PNL leader Liviu Orban said last week that Romania is ready for the union with the Republic of Moldova , adding that his party supports this idea.\nMeanwhile, more than 100 localities in the Republic of Moldova signed symbolic declarations of union with Romania, with some Romanian cities also adopting similar declarations. This has triggered a negative reaction from Moldovan president Igor Dodon, who said earlier this week that the Romanians who support the growing unionist movement in Chisinau risk becoming the Republic of Moldova\u2019s \u201cnumber one enemy.\u201d He also said Bucharest officials are tacitly supporting unionism, and this may affect the relations between the Republic of Moldova and Romania.\nIrina Marica, [email protected]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://unimedia.info/stiri/marea-adunare-centenara-de-duminica-basescu--orban-si-alti-oficiali-romani--vor-veni-la-chisinau-150292.html", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "traian basescu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national lib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constantin codreanu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel tudorache", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ludovic orban", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "red army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "popular movement party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great centennial assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bessarabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chisinau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bucharest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moldova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of moldova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:48:49.009+03:00"}], "totalResults": 22, "moreResultsAvailable": 12, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746189780&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3ARO+location%3ABucharest&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 884, "extra": {"place": "Bucharest", "country": "RO", "lat": "44.4267674", "lng": "26.1025384"}}
