[Photo by Elvis Ogina/Standard] \nThe Government has scrapped age and term limits for chief executive officers of State corporations. \nThe directive means that the CEOs can be re-appointed as many times as the appointing authority deems fit and work beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. \nThe removal of term limits is contained in a circular issued by Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua dated February 27, 2018, and titled \u2018Terms of Service for State Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officers\u2019. \nUnder the current regime, depending on the relevant Act creating the corporations, CEOs serve for a between three and five years and are eligible for re-appointment for a second term depending on their performance. The law also requires that the executives retire upon attaining 60 years. \nMr Kinyua\u2019s circular has overturned this requirements. \n\u201cThe Government has noted lack of clarity on terms of service for chief executive officers of state corporations and concerns at service period, which in some instance has led to litigation,\u201d Kinyua\u2019s circular copied to all Cabinet secretaries, the Attorney General, and all principal secretaries. Avoid fake news! Subscribe to the Standard SMS service and receive factual, verified breaking news as it happens. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840 \nThe circular states that the terms of service for CEOs are contractual and renewable based in performance and business requirements, and that they are not subject to the general public service policy on mandatory retirement at 60 or 65 years or limit as to the number of terms served. \n\u201cThe Circular No. OP. CAB.2/7A of March 20, 2009 on review of mandatory retirement age for public servants is therefore, not applicable to State corporations\u2019 chief executive officers,\u201d wrote Kinyua, referring to the policy that raised retirement age from 55 to 60 years. \nState corporations \n\u201cYou are required to bring the contents of this circular to the boards of directors of State corporations under your docket and to ensure they have put in place a robust mechanism for ensuring performance of CEOs and leadership requirements over time,\u201d Kinyua states. \nIt is not clear if the new directive supersedes section 80 of the Public Commission Act that bars public officers from serving beyond the 60-year age limit. \nWeed out officials \nThe section states: \u201c A public officer shall retire from the service with effect from the date of attaining the mandatory retirement age; and the commission or other appointing authority shall not extend the service of such retired public officer beyond the mandatory retirement age.\u201d \nAccording to the 2013 report of the Presidential Task Force on Parastatal Reforms, there are 257 State corporations in the country. \nThe report proposed mergers of State firms for efficiency but it has never been implemented. It stipulated that for the retained agencies no new contract of service shall be offered to a CEO who has served in the same State agency for two terms. \nThe proposal was designed to weed out entrenched officials and promote accountability. \nThe report proposed that the CEOs of retained agencies be allowed to serve their unexpired terms subject to performance and fully meeting the requirements for appointment or be allowed to serve the unexpired term up to a maximum period of six months. \nThe push to have the top civil servants serve beyond retirement age is likely to influence contract terms and succession plans for top State executive officers. It also adds to concerns about the ageing public service workforce and obstacles to succession management. \nData from the December, 2016 payroll revealed that 35 per cent of national government employees are aged between 51 and 60 years while 53 per cent are above 46 years. \nMajority of employees in management positions are over 46. \nCourt case \nThe decision to exclude CEOs from retirement age caps comes at a time when the Government is battling to retain Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner General John Njiraini, whose term has expired. \nThe KRA boss attained the age of 60 on December 19 last year while his second and final term expired on February 3 this year. \nA case has been filed in court to have him replaced. \nCentral Bank of Kenya Deputy Governor Sheila M\u2019Mbijjewe, who attained the official retirement age on Mach 6 this year, is still in office. \nCBK Governor Patrick Njoroge has said that his deputy would serve her full contract, which runs to mid next year. \nIn November 2016, Industrial Court Judge Nelson Abuodha issued orders stopping Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter from renewing then Kenya Power CEO Ben Chumo\u2019s term, ruling that he had reached the retirement age of 60. \nThe ruling also saw the then director general of the Energy Regulatory Commission, Joe Ng\u2019ang\u2019a, leave eight months before his contract expired. He was 61.

RETURN Dr Miguna is one of the Nasa leaders who paid the steepest price of 'swearing-in' Mr Odinga as the 'people\u2019s president' at Uhuru Park, Nairobi, on January 30. He was arrested, locked up incommunicado, moved from one police station to the other and deported despite a High Court order barring the same. The High Court on February 26 ordered his return to Kenya and suspended Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang\u2019i\u2019s declaration that Dr Miguna is a prohibited immigrant. Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita further suspended the cancellation of Dr Miguna\u2019s passport by the immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa. He ordered the Immigration Department to facilitate Dr Miguna\u2019s return from Canada, including arranging for his visa. The judge, at the same time, put on hold Dr Matiang\u2019i\u2019s gazette notice declaring the NRM, a wing of Nasa, a criminal gang. Judge Mwita ruled that Dr Miguna's rights were violated by his deportation. The Court of Appeal rejected government request to temporarily stop the High Court orders. The case is ongoing. The barrister, who practises in Canada, said he would land in Nairobi on March 26. \"The despots will fall, and they will fall starting March 26th when I arrive in Kenya. The Lunga Lunga dance for liberation will take place,\" Dr Miguna told the Nation at Heathrow. Additional report by Gabriel Otach in London.

By ROSE ODENGO \n\u201cMake yourselves indispensable,\u201d Viona Ojiambo\u2019s father would often tell her and her siblings. These words have been a lifelong guide to excellence for the 30-year-old mathematician. Viona grew up in Kahawa West, Nairobi County. Her father was a mathematics teacher at Nairobi Technical Training Institute, then a secondary school called Technical High school in Nairobi. Her father\u2019s life began humbly as a fisherman. He had experienced the power of hard work and self-drive, and instilled these qualities in Viona and her five siblings, besides taking keen interest in their academic performance. Mathematics for Viona came naturally, a factor she attributes to her father. To her, a mathematical equation was an exciting journey of discovery. \u201cMany people see big equations as complicated, but I ask myself, what is the secret behind it and how can I create a big equation like this?\u201d She says. Viona does admit that she struggled with languages in school, which affected her overall grades. Observing this, her parents encouraged her to focus on what she was good at, which was math, to improve her overall school grades, support Viona is grateful for. On graduation from Pangani Girls High School in 2005, she joined Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) where she pursued an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, graduating in 2011. She gives credit to Dr Duncan Kioi and Prof Matthew Kinyanjui, both mathematics lecturers who encouraged her to pursue her specialisation further with a Masters in Science in Applied Science at the same university, graduating in 2015. As Viona pursued her Master\u2019s Degree, she began to offer support to some of her lecturers, instructing classes, it was then that she fell in love with teaching. Now, just as her lecturers inspired her, she is offering the same inspiration to the next generation of mathematicians, instructing undergraduates in mathematics at JKUAT. An average working day for her starts at 4am or 5am and ends between 5am and 6pm, when she calls it a day and heads home to spend time with her three children. \u201cI believe in utilising the day hours well. Your brain can\u2019t function when you\u2019re tired, you need to rest,\u201d she emphasises. Her day is split between research, preparing for classes, instructing, marking assignments and setting exams, like most in academia. Viona also builds on her new research on her PhD, made possible through a scholarship from the Pan African University Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI). Her thesis is on the mathematical modeling of silica growth in geothermal pipes, in a field known as fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is the study in Physics of forces and flow within fluids such as liquids, gases and plasma (such as in human blood). For example, before buildings or drainage are constructed, a mathematician should develop a simulation of the flow of water, sewage and other gases or fluids from the building prior to construction. This provides the engineer with perfect dimensions for the pipes he needs for a building\u2019s drainage to avoid damage or even collapse of buildings due to leakage or cracks from pressure or corrosion. Viona\u2019s research explores the understanding of a common problem in geothermal pipes that causes corrosion, affects the efficiency of the geothermal pipes and in return increases the cost of maintenance of these pipes. Her research aims to find a way of resolving this problem by better understanding the cause of the silica growth. What is the difference between Pure and Applied Mathematics? Pure mathematics is the theory of mathematics. Ideally, it is explaining math in English form to understand the general concepts of the science of math. Applied mathematics, as the name suggests, you apply your knowledge of math to various disciplines such as medicine, physics and engineering, to come up with a specified solution. Many are convinced math is hard. How can we change this perception? The approach teachers take makes it very abstract. The best way to make mathematics exciting is to make it more practical. For example, X means cars or Y means the cost of labour. When you place these on a graph and make the derivative more relatable, the concepts are easier to grasp. What does one need to build a career in applied mathematics? You need an undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and explore an area of specialty in other scientific fields such as physics and medicine. How can we get more girls to build a career in Applied Mathematics? There are more girls enrolling now. People used to call JKUAT - Juja boys because the ratio of men to women was very high, but this is changing. Now in my average class of 180 students, women make up 40-50 per cent of the class. I believe the more we talk about and share stories of women in these fields the more we will encourage more women. What other careers can one pursue with a degree or Master\u2019s in Applied Mathematics? You need to place yourself in another discipline so that you can apply your mathematics in that discipline. For example, if interested in mathematical modeling of diseases, you can study a short course in epidemiology, the branch of medicine which deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health. With your bachelors of science in applied mathematics, you will be able create solutions in this field. You can apply this in medicine, physics, engineering, computer science, statistics, actuarial science, chemistry and psychology. What is the average income of a professor in Applied mathematics? It is an average of Sh100, 000 to Sh120, 000 net monthly, but this can go higher based on tenure, experience and qualifications. What is your advice to young girls interested in building careers in STEM? Be committed, focused and dedicated to achieving and realising your dreams.

[Photo by Edward Kiplimo/Standard] \nNational Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga's attempt to get senators to rescind their decision to remove Moses Wetang'ula as Senate minority leader has failed, yet again. \nAfter two hours of deliberations, Raila, who met 20 senators from the Opposition alliance in Nairobi yesterday, only managed to convince the lawmakers to convene a retreat within a fortnight. \nALSO READ: Raila, senators face off over Wetang'ula \nRaila had convened a crisis meeting just two days after the senators formally removed Mr Wetang\u2019ula and replaced him with Siaya's James Orengo. \nWetang\u2019ula, the Ford Kenya party leader, and Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, attended the meeting where, according to sources, the Opposition legislators stuck to their guns. \nAmani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi stayed away, with allies saying he did not want to join a meeting that would not yield any fruit. \n\u201cDuring the meeting, it emerged there were weighty matters that have to be deliberated and we have resolved that the senators will hold a retreat and report to the (NASA) summit within two weeks,\u201d Raila told journalists at the Panafric Hotel.   \nAsked if that meant that Mr Orengo's election stands, Raila and Kalonzo said an appropriate answer would be available after two weeks. \nHowever, three senators told The Standard separately that Wetang'ula's fate was sealed and not even the retreat could save him. \n\u201cWe just told our party boss that senators consciously made their decision to remove him and that has been done; there will be no reversal,\u201d one legislator said. \nThis was the first meeting the NASA summit was holding with senators following the ouster that threatens to break up the coalition. \nALSO READ: Raila futile bid to save Wetang\u2019ula \n\u201cWe have agreed as NASA that the unity of the coalition is important. All the principals are united, including our colleague Mudavadi, who had a board meeting hence his missing this meeting,\u201d Kalonzo said. \nWetang'ula's removal leaves NASA on the brink given that the three parties - Wiper, Ford-K and ANC - have complained about \"harassment\" by ODM. \nA similar attempt to save Wetang\u2019ula was thwarted by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, who rejected a letter from NASA Chief Executive Norman Magaya on grounds that it did not meet the threshold of Standing Orders. \nMr Lusaka proceeded to accept a letter from Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jr communicating the decision to elect Orengo as the new Leader of Minority. \nOn Tuesday, Kalonzo requested Orengo to decline the appointment \"so that he doesn't go down as the person who collapsed NASA\u201d.

Boniface Okerosi Misera and Cephas Kamande Mwaura will first serve a mandatory two-year jail term then pay the fine, the anti-corruption court ruled in Nairobi. FINE But if they do not pay the fine, they will serve an additional one year, the court ruled. Chief Magistrate Felix Kombo fined Mr Misera Sh40 million for fraudulently pocketing Sh10 million. The court slapped Mr Mwaura with Sh37.2 million fine for earning Sh9.3 million belonging to the defunct Nairobi City Council. The jailed men were part of a group of four city council officials and outsiders charged in the infamous Sh283 million cemetery land scandal that hit plans to acquire new burial grounds. The court convicted them after dismissing their defence that they did not play any role in the land scam . SCANDAL They were found to have doctored land transfer documents and earned from the scam illegally. The court fined them three times what they had acquired in accordance with the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. The cost of the land, which was located in Machakos County, was also found to have been inflated and did not meet the requirement of the land that the council needed for a graveyard. The court also agreed with witnesses who testified that the two were at the centre of the scandal. The court ruled that the prosecution proved the case to the required standards. In the cemetery fraud , public funds were used to buy 120 acres in Mavoko Township, which experts considered unsuitable for a graveyard. Taxpayers lost nearly Sh160 million in the scam.
