LNA forces also arrived at Brak Al Shatti airbase as part of the LNA\u2019s \u201cLaw enforcement\u201d operation in reaction to the ongoing fighting in the south of Libya. \nThe LNA forces\u2019 arrival also coincides with the arrival of the Faiez Serraj Presidential Council\u2019s committee in the south. \nTamenhint airbase is located 34 km from the southern regional capital Sebha, 769 km from the Libyan capital Tripoli and 1,146 km from Benghazi. \nThe airbase was re-taken by the LNA on 25 May 2017 after the Misratan-led Third Force withdrew from the area after the controversial massacre at the Brak Al-Shatti airbase in which dozens of LNA soldiers were killed. However, Taminhent remained under LNA-aligned forces from nearby towns and was used strictly for emergencies. \nSulieman Al Wahidi Al Si\u2019aiti nick-named as Al Massloukh (the skinny one) is now in command of the Tarik Ben Zeyad brigade, previously, Major Omar Emraja Al Magrahi and Issa Shu\u2019aib Al Barasi were in command. \nMeanwhile, in Sebha the Presidency Council (PC) formed Ceasefire Committee arrived on Wednesday and commenced engaging in peace talks between the warring Tebus and Awlad Sulieman tribes. \nAccording to the Faiez Serraj spokesperson, Mohamed Al Salaak, the committee is formed of the Minister of Local Governance, Bidad Gansu (a member of the Awlad Sulieman tribe), the Minister of Labour, Al Mahdi Al Wardami (a member of the Tebu tribe). the Minister of Refugees and Displaced, Abubaker Jalala, the Minister of Social Affairs, Fadi Al Sheafi and the Deputy of the Presidential Guard Commander, Brigadier Mohammed Lakri. \nThe Committee\u2019s plane took off back to Tripoli from the Sharara oilfield loaded with tens of injured and students. The Committee is trying to broker a sustained ceasefire deal and has been approaching disaffected parties through humanitarian channels. \nAccording to the Sebha health services office, some 4,500 people were forced to flee from mainly the Tayouri and Nassiriya districts of Sebha who were forced to seek shelter in schools at the Manshiya district. \nAn initial proposal is to clear the city from militia presence and weapons, especially residential areas where most of clashes are believed to have taken place. This will then be followed by work on strengthening and reactivating police departments and reorganising army units within the town. \nIt will be noted that the Tarik Ben Zeyad brigade is one of two powerful Salafist brigades aligned to the LNA, who alongside the Tawhid brigades, took part in the fighting against Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (BRSC) in the Benghazi district of Sabri. Abdul Fateh Ben Ghalboun, is another Salafist commander in charge of the Tawhid brigade in Benghazi and operating under the Saiqa Special Forces.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taminhent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarik ben zeyad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libyan national army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brak al shatti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya herald jamal adel press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faiez serraj presidential council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benghazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brak al-shatti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamenhint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tripoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T16:39:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78324305a81c7542a953f2539652eecfa5d2695f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwkPdgU4n1rl7KaOU8P890GDbfYqUGRbiWFy8QiwhzDMR776whP.1GW8pV6idEpqcvR1xbAKF0wHcrYsAjSaONt5pVFwOT6EZvRd.fvh0fTwkfe878rlEEWtXrHhPxrnZk5YEsrkPWYTR64hhdpc7X", "site_full": "www.marsad.ly", "site": "marsad.ly", "site_section": "http://www.marsad.ly/en/feed", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "Marsad Libya", "title": "Libya east forces say Tripoli SDF handed over Benghazi fighters detained in Tripoli", "title_full": "Libya east forces say Tripoli SDF handed over Benghazi fighters detained in Tripoli", "published": "2018-03-24T01:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "LY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marsad.ly/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/fc101268-1137-4ec3-9776-62f326c1858d_16x9_600x338-e1488133397773.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78324305a81c7542a953f2539652eecfa5d2695f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwkPdgU4n1rl7KaOU8P890GDbfYqUGRbiWFy8QiwhzDMR776whP.1GW8pV6idEpqcvR1xbAKF0wHcrYsAjSaONt5pVFwOT6EZvRd.fvh0fTwkfe878rlEEWtXrHhPxrnZk5YEsrkPWYTR64hhdpc7X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "asaeid", "published": "2018-03-24T01:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Libya east forces say Tripoli SDF handed over Benghazi fighters detained in Tripoli", "text": "Home / Normal / Libya east forces say Tripoli SDF handed over Benghazi fighters detained in Tripoli Libya east forces say Tripoli SDF handed over Benghazi fighters detained in Tripoli 23/03/2018 Libyan Express Press Articles The media outlets and social media of east-based Libya self-styled army led by Khalifa Haftar claimed Thursday that the Tripoli-based Special Deterrence Force (SDF) handed over fighters from the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) who were detained in Mitiga prison.

US air strike in southern Libya on Saturday, the government announced.\nThe strike was \u201ccoordinated\u201d with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj,

capital, Tripoli, Sallak said on his Twitter accound. \nHe later told AFP he was not immediately able to identify the jihadists targeted in the air strike. \nThe US African Command confirmed the strike. \u201cAt this time, we assess no civilians were killed in this strike,\u201d a statement said, according to Reuters . \nThe United States has carried out frequent raids on the Islamic State group in southern Libya. \nLibya has been gripped by chaos since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed dictator Moamer Gaddafi in 2011, with rival administrations and multiple militias vying for control of the oil-rich country. \nMilitants and people-traffickers have taken advantage of the chaos to gain a foothold in the North African country. \nIS has claimed several attacks in Libya, the latest in February when a suicide car bombing against the forces of Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar killed three militiamen. \nHaftar supports an administration in the east of the country, opposed to the Tripoli-based government of Serraj, who has struggled to assert his authority across the country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],
