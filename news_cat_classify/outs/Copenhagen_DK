Artists will use a variety of mediums including video, film and sculpture. \nLea Gulditte Hestelund is interested in how human bodies are ascribed meaning in contemporary western societies. In her solo exhibition, Consumed Future Spewed Up As Present (Overgaden, from April 7), she explores this topic through mysterious scenarios taken from science-fiction plotlines. \nDanish digital artist Christoffer Birkkj\u00e6r and Portuguese visual artists Duarte Filipe regularly collaborate to explore the intersection between classical drawing and computer visualisation. In their new installation, Even (Overgaden, from April 7), the artists examine landscape features such as mountains, cliffs, rivers and valleys. \nFirst day of the racing season April 6, 18:00; Klampenborg Galopbane, Klampenborgvej 52; 60kr; galopbane.dk Enjoy the fun and competitive spirit of Klampenborg Racetrack as it begins its 2018 season.

So it was perhaps a little surprising when the former minister, Helge Sander, and former bank boss Lars Seier Christensen floated the idea of bringing a Formula 1 grand prix to the streets of the capital. \nREAD ALSO: Copenhagen looking to host a Danish Grand Prix in 2020 This has now come a step closer. As a result of a request from the finance minister, Kristian Jensen, on Thursday this week, the idea was debated by the city council\u2019s Borgerrepr\u00e6sentationen. A slim majority consisting of Socialdemokratiet, Dansk Folkeparti, Venstre, Konservative and Liberal Alliance voted to enter into a dialogue with the government regarding the plan, reports DR Nyheder. Minimising the damage However, there are strings attached. \u201cIt is dependent on a number of conditions, amongst which are that it should not cost Copenhagen\u2019s taxpayers a penny,\u201d said Copenhagen\u2019s mayor Frank Jensen. The state will have to become a formal partner in the project and the municipality must not incur any extra expense. In addition, the inconvenience such an arrangement will cause must be minimised. On top of that, the race should be open to all and create job opportunities in Copenhagen. Not so green, perhaps One of the parties that voted against the plan is Enhedslisten. \u201cWe believe that Copenhagen should have a green profile. We would like to attract the tourists and companies that come to the city because of that,\u201d said Ninna Hedeager Olsen, the deputy mayor for technical and environmental matters. As far as the timeframe for a possible grand prix goes, it could take place in 2020 or 2021 if all the conditions are met.

The division is growing fast and is characterised by collegial, energetic staff and strong research collaborations with leading universities and industry worldwide. \nOur research focuses on understanding and improving the ways in which complex sociotechnical engineering systems are designed, managed, and operated throughout their life cycles. Our research spans the boundaries of 1. interdisciplinary engineering design, 2. engineering project, program and portfolio management, and 3. related policy, public engagement and strategic processes. By focusing on the themes of complexity, human behaviour, and uncertainty, we develop understanding, knowledge, methods and tools for public and private organisations to be more effective in the design, construction and operation of large-scale socio-technical engineering systems. Examples include applications in healthcare (e.g. development and integration of transformative technologies) or energy generation and distribution (e.g. design of industry cooperation networks). We believe that good design can deliver widespread benefits to society\u2019s challenges of health and wellbeing in the 21st century. \nThe Post-Doctoral Research Associate will be working in healthcare systems research at the intersection of design, technology, human behaviour, and health research. He/she will take a leading role in driving the research in healthcare system design forward, by engaging in the relationship between design and wellbeing, by bringing a systems perspective to health and care services, and thus by designing for life. \nKeywords include healthcare systems design, healthcare design, design for behaviour change, personalised health technologies, collaborative care, healthcare innovation, eHealth, Digital Health, healthcare analytics, behaviour monitoring, user-friendly and accurate visualisation of healthcare data. \nResponsibilities and tasks Technology is transforming healthcare. We are moving from centralised hospital care towards a more distributed connected care model that is widely accessible, personalised and collaborative. Mobile health applications and wearable sensing are empowering patients (and healthy users) to track and manage their own health, wellbeing and lifestyles. Data from medical and health/welfare technology can help care providers to understand and visualize trends, broadening their focus from diagnosis and treatment to prediction and prevention. The healthcare data landscape in Denmark is rich and accessibility for researchers among the best in the world. \nThe Post-Doctoral Research Associate is interested in leveraging technology both in the ways we conduct healthcare research and in the ways design can help to develop, adapt, and integrate technology and mobile health solutions into healthcare. The Post-Doc will have the opportunity to work in close connection with and build on ongoing university-hospital collaborative research on the adaptation and implementation of technology in cognitive rehabilitation, for active ageing, and for chronic disease management, with the long-term vision of improving the design of health care systems for connected and collaborative care. \nOverall, our healthcare research takes an engineering systems design perspective to integrate people, processes, and technology for more effective, personalised, collaborative, connected, and sustainable healthcare delivery and -improvement. We are motivated by the opportunities offered through the accelerating pace of technological innovation to ease the increasing burden of chronic disease. With a human-centric focus, we study how innovative technology and processes may be woven into existing health and care systems to improve treatment as well as early diagnosis and prevention. Our objectives are to develop conceptual design frameworks for healthcare improvement and to apply these frameworks to the real-life health and care challenges of our society, be it in the general population or in patient groups via collaborations with clinicians. Our ambitions are to provide both better and more cost-effective health care. In particular, all of our current projects aim to push the boundaries of how the interaction between people and novel Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), mobile-, and wearable technologies can help re-model care practices, especially in the fields of mental health, elderly care and active ageing, and hypertension. \nOne of our projects is exploring how wearables might be adapted to match the needs and capabilities of the dementia care network, how technologies and data might be used to understand patient behaviour and support clinical research, and how these findings can reinforce or rethink current care practices. Another of our initiative is related to the Stanford Medicine X Precision Research Challenge, for which we have been selected as one six finalists worldwide and enabled us to pursue a pilot study with more than 50 elderly participants enrolled. Another project explores how personalisation, patient apprenticeship/situated learning, and shared-decision making between patient and providers may promote behavioural change in hypertensive patients towards their increased engagement in therapy. The project will develop a conceptual healthcare design framework applied to the design, implementation and field trial of an ICT-solution for collaborative hypertensive care. \nSpecific tasks include the dissemination of knowledge in the form of peer-reviewed journal and conference contributions and the focus on acquisition of research funding for the group. \nThe Post-Doc will be working with partners from academic, health and industrial sectors. In particular, researchers from the Engineering Systems Division are active members of the Copenhagen Center for Health Technology ( cachet.dk ), connecting with researchers from other DTU Departments, health researchers from the Copenhagen University, representatives from the Municipality of Copenhagen and the Capital Region, neuropsychologists, doctors, nurses, patient organisations, caregivers and patients, and many more. The Post-Doctoral Research Associate will enter and continue to build health and care research and industry relationships across DTU, Denmark, and worldwide. \nQualifications Candidates should have a PhD degree or equivalent. \nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project means that applicants from a broad range of technical backgrounds will be considered. Applicants should have (or expect to obtain by the start date) a PhD degree, preferably in design, design engineering, engineering, computer or systems science, health sciences, computational social science, etc. Preference will be given to those candidates with a high level of English (and also Danish language skills) who can demonstrate an aptitude for conceptual and empirical work, modelling and programming, and the confidence to network within academic, public, and commercial organisations. \nFurther qualifications include: Excellent scientific dissemination skills and passion for writing.
