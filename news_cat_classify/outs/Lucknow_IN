TNN | Updated: Mar 24, 2018, 08:30 IST Highlights The party called off celebrations planned to mark the victory of its lone candidate Jaya Bachchan to show its solidarity towards the BSP SP had fielded Jaya Bachchan as its candidate with 10 MLAs to spare for the BSP nominee as per the tie-up with Mayawati The celebrations included a dinner at a five star hotel in Lucknow and a \"Bhajan sandhya\" at the party office Akhilesh yadav (File Photo) LUCKNOW: With the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate, backed by Samajwadi Party (SP), losing to BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls on Friday, will the bonhomie between the two arch rivals - who came together to hand out a stunning defeat to BJP in the recently-concluded byelections in UP - continue? The first strong signal, despite the loss, came from BSP national general secretary and Mayawati 's close aide Satish Chandra Mishra, who said that the \"SP did its best in supporting the BSP candidate.\" SP was equally receptive. The party called off celebrations planned to mark the victory of its lone candidate Jaya Bachchan to show its solidarity towards the BSP. \"We had the required votes to secure Jaya Bachchan's victory and had planned celebrations in advance. But, party chief Akhilesh Yadav cancelled the programme once results began pouring in,\" said Akhilesh's close aide and SP MLC Udaiveer Singh. The celebrations included a dinner at a five star hotel in Lucknow and a \"Bhajan sandhya\" at the party office where apart from Akhilesh and Jaya Bachchan, party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was also slated to attend among other top leaders. According top priority to his alliance with Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha polls, Akhilesh deputed some of his senior and trusted MLAs to vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) nominee on Friday. The move, that may have put to risk SP's own candidate, is being seen as an attempt of the SP chief to win over Mayawati for a more formal and strong alliance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Akhilesh picked trusted MLAs to vote for BSP With a total of 47 MLAs, SP had fielded Jaya Bachchan as its candidate with 10 MLAs to spare for the BSP nominee as per the tie-up with Mayawati ahead of the Lok Sabha bypolls. However, after party MLA Nitin Agarwal joined BJP just days before the RS election and another MLA Hari Om, who was in jail, was denied permission to vote, the party was left with only eight extra MLAs. This when the party had already assured support of at least nine MLAs to the BSP supremo in the RS polls. Taking no chances that could disrupt the new found SP-BSP bonhomie, SP insiders said Akhilesh went ahead to mend fences with independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh who was a member of his cabinet in the SP. Eventually, Raghuraj announced his support to Akhilesh at the SP\u2019s dinner party held on Wednesday. Thereafter, the SP chief hand-picked some of his most trusted legislators to vote for the BSP candidate to ensure that the party did not cut a sorry figure in case some of the party MLAs switched loyalties at the last moment. The final list of MLAs who would vote for the BSP was drawn on Thursday evening. On Friday, top SP leaders including leader of Opposition in assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary, Akhilesh\u2019s two trused MLAs Subhash Pasi and Shailendra Yadav alias Lallai\u2014who was the SP\u2019s polling agent for the RS elections\u2014voted for BSP, according to senior party leaders. \u201cThe list also included names like Manoj Paras, Nahid Hasan, Rafeeq Ansari, Virendra Yadav, Prabhu Narain Singh and Gauriganj MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh, who was the host of the SP dinner held on Wednesday,\u201d said a party MP who was privy to the list. \u201cPutting his trusted men in the list goes on to show that Akhilesh kept weak links with himself to vote for the SP candidate and in case of any crossvoting, it could have put the party candidate\u2019s election in jeopardy,\u201d said a political commentator. Political observers describe Akhilesh decision to depute party veteran like Ram Govind Chaudhary and Shailendra Yadav Lallai among others to vote for the BSP as an attempt to send a message across to the BSP leadership that he has not only lived up to the \u201cdharma\u201d of the SP-BSP tie-up but at the cost of putting to risk the election of SP\u2019s otherwise secure candidate.

The BSP leader exuded confidence that all the nine surplus MLAs of the Samajwadi Party as well as seven of the Congress and one of the RLD have voted in favour of his party candidate. \"All the seven Congress MLAs went together to vote, while the SP has given us a list of their loyal MLAs,\" Uma Shankar said.

Independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi said he was with 'Maharaj ji' and would vote for the BJP. There are 11 candidates for 10 Rajya Sabha seats and 37 first preference votes required for victory in each seat. Since the BJP and its allies have 324 seats in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the saffron party can easily bag eight of the 10 seats and will still be left with 28 surplus votes as the four-MLA strong Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has decided to go with the ruling party. \"There can be some contest on the ninth seat,\" a senior UP BJP leader said. The Samajwadi Party, which has fielded Jaya Bachchan, and the BSP, which nominated Bhimrao Ambedkar, appeared confident of winning one each of the remaining two seats.

BJP allotted 39 MLAs apiece to its first eight candidates though it needed only 37 to make them win. That left only 12 MLAs of the NDA (which has 324 MLAs) for BJPs ninth candidate, Anil Agrawal but BJP made sure he sailed through by the second preference votes cast enmasse for him by the 324 NDA MLAs. \"No chances were taken for the first eight candidates as we did not want any invalid votes to mar our chances,\" a senior UP BJP leader told ET. Senior MLAs were alloted to the three prominent candidates, Arun Jaitley, GVL Narsimha Rao and Anil Jain, as a further precautionary measure. Each candidate was also allotted a senior Minister who ensured the allotted MLAs cast their vote for their enmarked candidate - senior UP minister Satish Mahana for example oversaw the MLAs who voted for Arun Jaitley. Senior Union Minister Piyush Goyal was sent to Lucknow on Thursday to strategise the moves along with CM Yogi Adityanath and both leaders remained in close touch with all MLAs to ensure they voted as per the plan. Goyal supervised a mock voting drill of all NDA MLAs on Thursday as many of them were first-time MLAs. BJP also succeeded in getting three upper-caste MLAs outside its camp to vote for its ninth candidate, Anil Agrawal who ultimately got 16 first preference votes instead of 12 alloted for him by NDA. Nishad party MLA Vijay Mishra, Independent MLA Amanmani Tripathi and BSP MLA Anil Singh voted for BJPs Anil Agrawal. Independent MLA Vinod Saroj may have voted for Agrawal too. Saroj is loyal to independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh who said he voted for SPs Jaya Bachchan but went after voting to meet Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. \"We knew the BSP candidate will not reach 37 vote mark as one of that party's MLA was cross voting for us while one BSP and one SP MLA were denied permission to come out of jail and vote. The BSP candidate ultimately got only 32 first preference votes. Our strategy focussed on getting our ninth candidate to win by second preference votes - and it fell perfectly as per plan,\" a UP BJP leader said.

Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Updated: March 23, 2018 5:26 pm MLAs flash a victory sign as they are seen from a window waiting for their turn to cast vote for the Rajya Sabha in Lucknow on Friday. (PTI Photo) \nAs the polling on ten seats in the 245-member Rajya Sabha began in Uttar Pradesh, talks of cross-voting appeared to play spoilsport for the opposition, especially for BSP\u2019s ninth candidate, Bhim Rao Ambedkar. While each political party claimed that their votes were intact, some MLAs shifted their loyalties claiming that they voted in favour of \u201cMaharaj ji\u201d, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. \nA neck to neck fight continued between BJP\u2019s ninth candidate, who appeared short of atleast five votes and BSP candidate who was short of three votes, at the time of filing this story. Challenges for BSP\u2019s Ambedkar increased after party MLA Mukhtar Ansari and SP MLA Hariom Yadav was not allowed to vote by the court. \nFollow Rajya Sabha Elections 2018 LIVE UPDATES HERE \nAs the voting began at 9 am, SP MLA and former Minister Shivpal Yadav was among some of the early voters in the assembly. Amid talks of cross-voting, Shivpal hinting at Jaya Bachchan assured that \u201cboth the candidates would win\u201d. Earlier in the day, CM Adityanath, also visited BJP Legislative Party office to meet the MLAs. \nHowever, as the day progressed, NISHAD party lone MLA Vijay Mishra made it clear that he had voted in favour of BJP to keep the unity of the country alive. \u201cDesh ki akhandata, bharstachara mukti\u2026desh ke gareeboon ko dhyan me rakhte hue vote diya , (Voted for unity, corruption-free country, keeping in mind the poor people of India),\u201d said Mishra. The shift in allegiance comes on the heels of Gorakhpur bypolls where the party had supported the SP-BSP combine. Soon, BSP MLA Anil Singh also claimed that he listened to the \u201cinner voice\u201d and went with \u201c Maharaj ji \u201d. \u201c Antaratma ki awaj mein Maharaj ji ke sath chalegaye ,\u201d said Singh. \nThe cross-voting changed the arithmetic of votes for the opposition, especially with independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, clearing in a tweet that his support for Akhilesh does not mean his support for BSP. \u201cNa main badla hun na meri rajnaitik vichardhara badali hai. Main Akhilesh ji ke sath hun ka yeh artha nahi ki main BSP ke sath hun.\u201d tweeted Singh. \nMeanwhile, SP MLA Nitin Agarwal, whose father Naresh Agarwal had recently joined BJP, also made it clear that he voted in favour of BJP candidate and so did independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi. After casting his vote, Nitin said, \u201c Samajwadi Party chose someone who entertains the society, people will not accept her.\u201d \nCongress, which has seven MLAs in the state, had announced its support to BSP candidate issuing a party whip. Congress assured that their MLAs had not gone against the whip and voted for BSP. \nWhile the opposition alleged BJP of \u201chorse-trading\u201d, the party clarified that they have not approached anyone and that the support from various leaders was being offered as they expressed faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CM. \u201cWe are going to win all the nine seats. It is not we, who started this. In fact, BSP with just 19 MLAs fielded their candidate, so they started it. Since we had 28 additional votes for the ninth candidate we fielded too and all of them will win,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.

While the ruling BJP is assured of eight of 10 Rajya Sabha seats for which voting was underway today, the Samajwadi Party has fielded Jaya Bachchan and the BSP Bhimrao Ambedkar for the remaining two seats. As the parties totted their numbers, BSP MLA Anil Singh indicated that he had cross-voted in favour of the BJP, saying \"I am with Maharaj-ji\", a reference to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The Unnao MLA's vote could be crucial as it gives the BJP the edge in getting a ninth Rajya Sabha seat from Uttar Pradesh. However, reports also said that he met UP CM Yogi Adityanath after casting his vote. The Allahabad High Court has denied permission to BSP's Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in Banda jail, to vote in the Rajya Sabha elections. And a court in Firozabad has rejected a petition by SP MLA Hariom Yadav, who is in Firozabad jail. The Opposition is now banking heavily on the two votes of Independents -- Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya and his close associate and MLA Vinod Saroj. Both appeared set to vote for SP's Jaya Bachchan, prompting party chief Akhilesh Yadav to thank Raja Bhaiya and post a picture with him on Twitter. Raja Bhaiya, who has had a rocky relationship with BSP chief Mayawati, had tweeted this morning that he was with \"Akhileshji\" and specified that it did not mean that he was with the BSP. The BSP did not take an adverse view of Raja Bhaiya's comment. \"... had he any reservations he would have said openly,\" said BSP deputy leader in the Vidhan Sabha Uma Shankar Singh. He added that he could not be sure that Anil Singh had voted for the BSP candidate. Keeping it ambiguous, Anil Singh said that he had cast his vote and showed it to BSP agent Lalji Verma and the rest could be known from him. \"I have cast my vote after showing it to Lalji Verma and he will tell you the details... I am with Maharaj-ji (Adityanath),\" he said after voting at the Tilak Hall in the Assembly complex. According to Uma Shankar, 17 MLAs of the total 19 BSP legislators had cast their votes by midday and shown them to Verma. The BSP leader exuded confidence that all the nine surplus MLAs of the Samajwadi Party as well as seven of the Congress and one of the RLD have voted in favour of his party candidate. \"All the seven Congress MLAs went together to vote, while the SP has given us a list of their loyal MLAs,\" Uma Shankar said. Independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi also said he was with 'Maharaj-ji' and would vote for the BJP. There are 11 candidates for 10 Rajya Sabha seats and 37 first preference votes are required for victory in each seat. Since the BJP and its allies have 324 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the saffron party can easily bag eight of the 10 seats and will still be left with 28 surplus votes as the four-MLA strong Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party has decided to go with the ruling party. \"There can be some contest on the ninth seat,\" a senior UP BJP leader said.

An LMC team will conduct a survey to determine the number of vendors in a ward to be granted permission. \n\nMunicipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh has directed the committee working on tobacco-related issues to prepare a draft for the licence system which can be implemented soon. \n\nHe said, \"We aim to implement licence system for tobacco vendors from the next financial year.\" \n\nTill date there is no regulation of tobacco products' sale and vendors opened shops wherever they wished. Many are also seen flouting the guidelines of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003 (COTPA) which restricts sale of eatables at tobacco shops. The rule also says that there should be no tobacco shop within 100 metre periphery of a school. \n\nLMC is planning to keep the licence fee considerably high to discourage people from selling tobacco products. As per the latest Global Adult Tobacco Survey , the consumption of tobacco has declined in India, but has shot up in UP. \n\nTIMESVIEWIt is a good move but success will depend on following three factors: 1) It will be a herculean task for the LMC to enroll tobacco vendors given the huge number of shops across the city. 2) LMC will have to put a dedicated team for issuance of licences and monitoring to catch violators. 3) LMC's track record in implementing such measures has been poor. For examples, many tobacco shops can be found around schools and colleges in violation of law. Hence, implementation would require seriousness on the part of senior officials.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "uday raj singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow municipal corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:07:04.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 177, "moreResultsAvailable": 167, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746438729&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3ALucknow&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 860, "extra": {"place": "Lucknow", "country": "IN", "lat": "26.8466937", "lng": "80.94616599999999"}}
