According to forecasts, the dismal weather is expected in all of mainland Portugal until at least Sunday. \nSeven districts - Viana do Castelo, Braga, Porto, Aveiro, Coimbra, Leiria and Lisbon \u2013 will be on yellow alert on Saturday due to forecasts of rough seas and waves that could reach heights of 12 metres. \nThe bad weather is blamed on \u201cDepression Hugo\u201d which is centred northwest of the Azores archipelago. \nAnd with the Algarve having just recorded its 24th cliff collapse of the winter ( click here ), people are advised to stay away from coastal areas. \nVisit www.ipma.pt to stay updated on the latest weather warnings and forecasts.
