DEL Det var knyttet stor spenning til kampen. Tidligere LSK-trener Monica Knudsen har tatt over V\u00e5lerenga, mens flere tidligere Lillestr\u00f8m-spillere ogs\u00e5 har byttet ut gult med bl\u00e5tt. L\u00f8rdag var gjestene klart best og s\u00f8rget for at samtlige som er glad i Lillestr\u00f8m fikk en over gjennomsnittet god l\u00f8rdag. Hege Riises lag ga seg ikke f\u00f8r det sto 5-0, og det siste m\u00e5let kan fort st\u00e5 igjen som sesongens scoring n\u00e5r det skal telles opp til slutt. Guro Reiten dro med seg ballen over midtstreken etter 71 minutter, og hun s\u00e5 da at V\u00e5lerenga-keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela sto langt ute. LSKs nummer 10 dro til, og ballen forsvant i en bue over Korpela og dalte ned i den finske burvokterens venstre hj\u00f8rne. F\u00f8r det hadde Ingrid Engen gitt gjestene ledelsen etter fem minutter. I det 51. minutt doblet Sophie Roman Haug til 2\u20130 da hun p\u00e5 vakkert vis headet inn et str\u00f8kent innlegg av Synne Skinnes Hansen. LSK-laget la p\u00e5 til 3-0 etter 61 minutter etter vakkert angrepsspill. Ingrid Moe Wold fant Reiten inne i feltet, og p\u00e5 vakkert vis satte hun inn scoringen. Kun minutter senere ga oppskriften Skinnes Hansen/Haug scoring igjen. F\u00f8rstnevnte svingte inn et perfekt innlegg, og Haug kunne sette skotuppen til og juble for sin andre nettkjenning for kvelden. Ydmykelsen ble total for V\u00e5lerenga med Marte Berget fra Gran p\u00e5 laget da Reiten scoret fra midtbanen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ingrid moe wold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korpela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katrine buer s\u00f8nden\u00e5", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guro reiten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tinja-riikka korpela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "v\u00e5lerenga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terje pedersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terje av", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hege riises", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica knudsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ntb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "v\u00e5lerenga", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T22:25:16.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cca9db7494837b71b33e0154d226e275ab7f64c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83o2p0_l8sJvq3OJOC8pzEu.yUSzq4Qvv1NDVrFugw.g3BcZV81KckwlhC2e7ZfNPLAu_X.kUAQ1D6RrYPRPdz5GXx2oDDnzS1y3ZEVXe9zQ--", "site_full": "www.tradewindsnews.com", "site": "tradewindsnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.tradewindsnews.com/rss2/casualties/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.tradewindsnews.com", "title": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "title_full": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/article1458947.ece5/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_600/34bcdba050f873b6138470138f5715ca", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cca9db7494837b71b33e0154d226e275ab7f64c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83o2p0_l8sJvq3OJOC8pzEu.yUSzq4Qvv1NDVrFugw.g3BcZV81KckwlhC2e7ZfNPLAu_X.kUAQ1D6RrYPRPdz5GXx2oDDnzS1y3ZEVXe9zQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gary Dixon", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "text": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing Singapore OSV owner's new investor wants continued presence in Norway. \nThe restructuring of heavily indebted Singapore OSV owner EMAS Offshore is contingent on its retaining its primary Oslo listing, it has revealed. \nThe company is continuing to work together with its advisers, creditors and key bank lenders to ensure a vital refinancing. \nWhite knight BTI, a subsidiary of BakerTechnology, is looking to invest up to $50m in the company in return for a majority stake under a term sheet signed in early December. \nOn 15 March, the company received an improved restructuring plan from BTI, it said, without giving further details. \nThe plan requires the continued listing of the company\u2019s shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on terms that are acceptable to BTI. \nDelisting coming? \nThis could be a problem, however, as the Oslo bourse is on course to delist the company on 27 April. \nEMAS can continue to make representations to the exchange in the meantime, after an initial appeal failed this week. \nThe bourse has previously said EMAS was \u201cnot in a position to comply with its financial reporting obligations\u201d. \nEMAS said: \"The group will work closely with its investors, principal bank lenders and other stakeholders to bring to fruition the restructuring plan in the near future.\" \nIts principal bank lenders had indicated support for the refinancing plan in February. \nHuge loss last year \nThe company also revealed a loss of $705.66m for 2017.

Photo: H\u00e5kon Mosvold Larsen / NTB scanpix The Local 20 March 2018 08:15 CET+01:00 Sylvi Listhaug has resigned as Norway's Minister of Justice following a motion of no confidence against her by opposition parties. \nParliament had been set to vote on the motion of no confidence on Tuesday. \nBut the minister pre-empted the vote by announcing her resignation early Tuesday morning, stating she could not allow the Progress Party to lose power over her departure. \nListhaug is a high-profile figure in the anti-immigration party, which is part of Norway\u2019s tripartite coalition government. \nPrime Minister Erna Solberg earlier said that if there was a majority against Listhaug, she would call a vote of confidence ( kabinettssp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l in Norwegian) in the entire government, potentially resulting in new elections or either Solberg or Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, the head of the opposition, being asked to form a new government. \nThe minister said her resignation was made on her own initiative. The decision is reported by state broadcaster NRK to have come as a surprise to both Solberg and Progress Party leader Siv Jensen. \n\u201cI appreciate that Siv and the entire [Progress] party were prepared to prepared to set aside our position as a government partner to support me as justice minister. But I cannot allow my departure to result in the Progress Party losing power and influence,\u201d Listhaug wrote in a statement, which was also posted on her Facebook page. \nShe is reported to have given no indication on Monday to government or Progress Party leadership of her intention to resign. \n\u201cIt was entirely up to me whether to see this through to the end or to step down,\u201d she wrote. \nThe minister's resignation is the culmination of political and public outcry over an image and message posted by Listhaug on Facebook. \nIn the March 9th social media post , which contained a photo of al-Shabaab militants, she accused Labour of considering that \"the rights of terrorists are more important than the security of the nation\". \nShe was criticising Labour's opposition to a proposal to strip the citizenship of Norwegians who pose a threat to the nation's vital interests, without a court order. \nLabour members were the main victims of the deadliest attacks on Norwegian soil since the Second World War when, on July 22nd, 2011, Anders Breivik, who once was a member of the Progress Party, killed 77 people in twin attacks: one targeting then Labour prime minister Jens Stoltenberg's office in Oslo and another against a Labour youth camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. \nIn the message confirming her resignation, the minister wrote that her post \u201cwas nothing to do with July 22nd\u201d and claimed the subsequent outrage was a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. \n\u201cI have found this to be nothing but a witch-hunt, in which Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re\u2019s intention was to connect freedom of speech to an issue which is one of the most important things we must discuss for Norway\u2019s future,\u201d she wrote. \n\u201cThe most important thing for me is the Progress Party and that it will continue to govern Norway,\u201d she said at a press conference Tuesday according to NRK \u2019s report. \nShe also reiterated her criticism at Tuesday\u2019s press meeting of St\u00f8re for connecting her Facebook post to the July 22nd attacks. \n\u201cThe aim of the [2017] election campaign was to keep Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re away from the Prime Minister\u2019s office, and that is still my goal. I don\u2019t think he is suitable for the role of Prime Minister of Norway. I am happy that Siv [Jensen] and the rest of the party have supported me 100 percent.

She specializes in security politics, global order and opposition to liberal values, focusing in particular on Russia and the US. 21/03/2018 \nOn Sunday 18 March, Russians head to the polls. Several events in Oslo discuss Putin\u2019s victory. It is usually a bad testament to a regime\u2019s democratic character if such events can be planned in advance. \nYet, Putin is unquestionably popular. Although the opposition is limited in its room for maneuver, Russia is not a totalitarian regime, as some have argued. The election is nevertheless neither free nor fair. \nThis poses a challenging question: On what basis do we evaluate Russia? \nIn the 1990s, there was an expectation that Russia would become like \u201cus\u201d. Thus, we apply a different standard to Russia than for example China. Russia is close and similar enough to be compared to our own political praxis, yet also different enough to be kept outside the idea of what constitutes \u2018Europe\u2019. We criticize China, but far more cautiously. \nWhen Putin first came to power in the autumn of 1999, he gave a speech in which he argued that while Russia was European, it shouln\u2019t be measured by the same standards as liberal democracies. Since then, the regime has increasingly emphasized its distinctly conservative character, in particular from Putin\u2019s third presidential period in 2012 and onwards. In parallel, the regime has intensified its criticism of Western international politics. It is today easy to forget that Russian authorities were once open to join both the EU and NATO. \nFor many of us working on Russian foreign and security policy, it has been a point to nuance some of the criticism levied against our eastern neighbor with reference to what the world looks like from the Kremlin. The annexation of the Crimea in 2014 was, for instance, a clear violation of international law, but hardly a sign of a new, nationalist and/or expansionist imperialism. The Crimea holds a very special role in Russian identity and cannot be compared to for example the Baltic states, as some have done in various threat assessments. \nThe Russian threat has, at times, been presented as disproportionally large. This unfortunately also catalyzes negative reactions from the Russian side, not unlike the ones that come when people feel that they are being unfairly treated. \nBreakups rarely happen overnight or out of the blue. Western authorities have generally been dismissive of constructive input from Russia, as in relation to the war in Libya. Their criticism of Western military interventions is shared by many academics, but when the criticism is coming from Russia, it is interpreted as polemics. \nLast Tuesday, the independent UN Commission for Syria published a report detailing civilian casualties. \nThe report concludes that both Russian and American air strikes are the cause of mass civilian deaths. A Russian attack in November 2017 killed at least 84 people, an American attack in March 2017 at least 150 people. Both countries should be criticized heavily. Nevertheless, the criticism against Russia is far more visible in the media, which they can unfortunately use to undermine it. \nFrom a Russian point of view, the authorities are tired of being evaluated according to standards to which their critics do not adhere. Russia correctly points to the double standards applied to Western versus Russian behavior, such as in the US cooperation with Saudi Arabia. If we are to criticize someone morally in international politics, we should do so on principles that are clear and apply to everyone on an equal basis. As a result of the inconsistency in who and what many governments choose to criticize, Russian authorities can more easily and reject otherwise legitimate criticism. \nCriticizing Russia for interfering in US elections while tacitly looking the other way when the US meddles in other countries\u2019 elections and regimes raises tough questions. The US-based researcher Dov Levin has investigated election interference by the US and the Soviet Union/Russia during the period 1946-2000. Levin counts at least 81 interferences by the US, 36 by Russia. After 2000, the USA has interfered in elections such as in Kenya (2013), Lebanon (2009) and Afghanistan (2009). \nHe defines election interference as \u201ca costly act which is designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one of the two sides\u201d. \nIs the action itself good as long as the intent is \u2018good\u2019, and is the intent good as long as we consider the actor to be good? Some seem to argue that American interferences are legitimate due to the liberal foundation on which they are based, despite the occasionally very negative outcomes, such as in Iraq and Libya. The attempt to remove president Karzai from power in Afghanistan in 2009 was, on the other hand, primarily about US self-interests, not a larger moral good. \nDuring the past few years, Norwegian media have also jumped to rash and unfounded conclusions about Russian behavior. \nThe debate about Storskog in the autumn of 2015 is a clear example. As researchers Lars Rowe and Arild Moe have successfully argued, the accusation that Russian authorities controlled the flow of refugees \u2013 as a form of hybrid war \u2013 was unfounded. We should keep that debate in mind when we choose to judge Russia for a negative action which it may have had the motivation to do, but without any evidence to substantiate our claims. \nAs the enemy image has grown stronger, less documentation is apparently required to accuse Russia of transgressions. It does not mean that Russia, for example, is not behind the poisoning of the former spy Sergej Skripal and his daughter in England, but a potential motive cannot automatically be equated with guilt. \nThat said, the authorities aren\u2019t making it any easier for those of us who want to nuance the image of Russian politics. \nRussia is currently ranked 148 th out of 180 countries on the Reporters without Borders\u2019 annual index of press freedom. Critical journalists are risking their lives. If freedom of speech is a political and/or moral priority, we should be able to criticize. The same goes for the systematic stigmatization of gays, lesbians and other who do not fit into the hetero-normative family idealization. \nThe regime is moving in an increasingly conservative and authoritarian direction, on par with countries like Turkey. \nThere is, nevertheless, another important side of Russian foreign policy: the border cooperation. This year, we are celebrating 25 years of the Barents Cooperation. In 2017, the number of border resident cross-border journeys increased by 25.5 percent. Marit Jacobsen of the Barents Secretariat stated that this traffic \u201cshows that people want to be in touch with their neighbors and are curious about each other\u201d. \nOur neighbor is perceived differently in the north than in Oslo, where the image of Russia is more tightly linked to the regime and Putin. That is also why the arrest of Frode Berg, a driving force behind the people-to-people cooperation, was all the more disappointing. \nI have had the pleasure of spending parts of my childhood in Russia, and many journeys and stays in the years after. Russia has become a part of my identity, and the current enemy image is physically palpable. Criticism of the state\u2019s policies leaks into xenophobia against ordinary Russians. Over the past few years, it has also become more difficult to nuance the representation of Russia in research contexts. \nI can only imagine how difficult this enemy image might feel like for those of Russian origins in Norway.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "minda holm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "norwegian institute of foreign affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danish institute for international studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:05:12.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9058a329bfda19a12c42f3f083352d6c96f22eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IK5b9ahrgZ54icXlZtNN9jG9rFCYspAg.a0SB0SqywLkJhjc1zSwEItWaa_HGXvR.krRi5DcQhTg--", "site_full": "elverumfhs.no", "site": "elverumfhs.no", "site_section": "http://elverumfhs.no/feed/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Elverum folkeh\u00f8gskole", "title": "Film fra Teater/Musikal i Oslo", "title_full": "Film fra Teater/Musikal i Oslo", "published": "2018-03-23T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://elverumfhs.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/teater-musikal-i-oslo-elverum-folkehgskole.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9058a329bfda19a12c42f3f083352d6c96f22eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IK5b9ahrgZ54icXlZtNN9jG9rFCYspAg.a0SB0SqywLkJhjc1zSwEItWaa_HGXvR.krRi5DcQhTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eivind Ellingsen H\u00f8imyr", "published": "2018-03-23T15:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Film fra Teater/Musikal i Oslo", "text": "Film fra Teater/Musikal i Oslo 2018-03-23 2018-03-23 http://elverumfhs.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elverum-FHS-logo_web_retina_v3.png Elverum folkeh\u00f8gskole http://elverumfhs.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/teater-musikal-i-oslo-elverum-folkehgskole.jpg 200px 200px Skriv en kommentar", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elverum-fhs-logo_web_retina_v3.png elverum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T12:31:56.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a25cb24b4b874760c01b8adb4c96e07b6f22752", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApt2Sz72Xr9xK6Ssf9gUDUQbDgDe5GCJschyJyCw2NsfAAxWItCyEs8gMSQpgVfOw79F3ufsT_qgGK_ceETX3OZhS.Zol.2G.Nv_PIGqFSEJog--", "site_full": "montagesmagazine.com", "site": "montagesmagazine.com", "site_section": "http://montages.no/feed/", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Montages", "title": "Painful but necessary: Erik Poppe\u2019s U \u2013 July 22", "title_full": "Painful but necessary: Erik Poppe\u2019s U \u2013 July 22", "published": "2018-03-24T11:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://montagesmagazine.com/files/2018/03/utoys-720x310.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a25cb24b4b874760c01b8adb4c96e07b6f22752", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApt2Sz72Xr9xK6Ssf9gUDUQbDgDe5GCJschyJyCw2NsfAAxWItCyEs8gMSQpgVfOw79F3ufsT_qgGK_ceETX3OZhS.Zol.2G.Nv_PIGqFSEJog--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anne Gjelsvik", "published": "2018-03-24T11:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Painful but necessary: Erik Poppe\u2019s U \u2013 July 22", "text": "NRK special news broadcast Helge Lur\u00e5s : \u2018It doesn\u2019t have to be a group with an international agenda, these could be local groups, elements from Norwegian immigrant community exhibiting antipathy towards norwegian society.\u2019 \nThe perception that terrorist equals Muslim is also touched upon in the film. \u2018Is it, like, terrorism?\u2019, Magnus ( Aleksander Holmen ), a participant at the summer camp, asks when news of the bomb in Oslo reaches Ut\u00f8ya. One of the others, Issa ( Sorosh Sadat ), quickly replies \u2018I hope it wasn\u2019t Muslims who did it, or all hell will break loose\u2019. \nThis is why it the film\u2019s focus, in its closing titles, on the terrorist\u2019s goals, ideology and notion of an enemy is both crucial and correct; without it, the atrocities could not be contextualized. It is also important that other pick up where this film leaves off. * To see or not to see 18 February 2018 Now This: Emma Gonzalez (activist/survivor of the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School 14 February 2018): \u00abI know it is hard to watch those videos, and some people are saying \u00abhow dare they post something like that\u00bb. No, if we had to live through it you should have to live through it too, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take for you to understand what it feels like then watch the freakin video.\u00bb \nSeeing this film, thinking about it, and writing about it, has been difficult, and it has affected me for days. This film is not for everyone , but I think it is for many more than many think. \n\u2018Do we need to see this?\u2019 or \u2018What good will making a film do?\u2019, are of course pertinent questions. But, above all, it is important to remember that not everyone has their own memories of 22 July. Those who today embark on their teens were young children when this happened, and the narratives we create now are both for those who still remember and those who were not yet born. For the youth of today, as for many others, reaching for the books of \u00c5sne Seierstad, Aage Storm Borchgrevink ( A Norwegian Tragedy: Anders Behring Breivik and the Massacre on Ut\u00f8ya , 2012) or Kjetil Stormark ( Da terroren rammet Norge: 189 minutter som rystet verden /\u00abWhen Terrorism Struck Norway, 189 Minutes that Shocked the World\u00bb, 2012) to understand may not be the obvious choice. \nWhile choosing whether or not to see the film is up to the individual, it does come with challenges not so easily avoided. The media attention surrounding this film, and the other films soon to come (Reconstructing Ut\u00f8ya [Carl Jav\u00e9r] will appear in cinemas this autumn; Norway [ Paul Greengrass ] is to be released on Netflix around the same time; Sara Johnsen and P\u00e5l Sletaune s television series will premiere on NRK in 2019) can be difficult for survivors and loved ones, and is not something one can opt out of. \nI often defend film as a medium from those who see a contradiction between film and art, or think film can only ever be entertainment. We are so used to encountering killers, violence and gunfire as part of entertainment products, that the notion of a film about mass murder being something other than that might seem alien. Sitting down in a full theatre, where others in the audience had brought popcorn and sweets, to see this film, was thus disconcerting. \nPerhaps we have become more desensitized to violence. The latest crime fiction about serial killers, or the latest school massacre on the news, might pass us by without leaving much of a trace or spurring much reflection. But maybe film as a medium, and a film such as this specifically, can help combat our insensitivity, as Indiewire film critic David Ehrlich claims in a piece linking Poppes film to American school shootings. That was my sense, at least, as I, along with everybody else in a full theatre, sat quiet and motionless until all of the end credits, and the final notes of Wolfgang Plagge s moving soundtrack, were gone. \nCinema has qualities and characteristics that make unique experiences possible, and as such, film can offer different kinds of explorations of these incidents of terrorism than literature, music, or other visual arts can. When people hesitate to approach Ut\u00f8ya as a filmic experience, it is particularly in fear of encountering images they wish not to see, or have attempted to avoid creating for themselves. But the film does not visualise violence nearly as much as one might fear, and I am not the only one to express relief that it is less painful to watch than expected. Many of the young people who were there on that day did not witness violence directly; they saw paths, rocks, bushes, and other frightened and desperate kids. The facts described in the verdict from the 22 July trial is far, far more brutal than this film. \nAs a fact-based fiction film, U \u2013 July 22 supplements the information offered by the verdict, the reports, the non-fiction prose and the news media. Not even \u00c5sne Seierstad\u2019s literary approach and multi-faceted perspective provided the intensity Poppe and his team have achieved in their rendering of what the kids on the island experienced during those 72 minutes of executions. It is too soon to say how important this work will be to us, but I am already certain that it will provide us with new insights. It could also potentially become politically significant. \nWhat U \u2013 July 22 offers, as the first work on this subject matter so far, is a sense of presence. It brings us very close to the camaraderie, and the loneliness; it captures frightened breaths. It shows us how easy it was to trip on the steep slopes, how few places there were to hide, how muddy it was (although the real place was even wetter). What we are left with is not mainly images in our minds or sounds in our ears; it is an engulfing bodily sensation. I have felt the island against my back, because I have lain on pine needles along with Kaja and other terrified youths. I have felt Tyrifjorden against my shins, because I have tossed my shoes and attempted to wade to safety upon the sharp rocks there. I have been frozen, by fear and by the cold. I have felt my heart pounding in my chest as I try to hide behind a rock face that offers no shelter. 22 July has, with this film, been given body as well as face. \nAnd this is why I am happy U \u2013 July 22 was made, and that Erik Poppe was the one to pick up this immense challenge and put it on his own, and his collaborators\u2019, shoulders. Together with a strong team of contributors, not least the young amateur actors led by Andrea Berntzen, the director has given life and soul to the events of that day. Working through a trauma that has affected so many is a heavy undertaking, and bringing such a project home requires determination, skill, experience, and a strong moral compass. U \u2013 July 22 is Poppes most important work, and as such it is a good thing that it is also his best. *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik poppe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helge lur\u00e5s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magnus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksander holmen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "issa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorosh sadat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nrk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stoneman douglas high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ut\u00f8ya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T16:32:06.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34bbff9d28642783f9357df66cad59f28458b0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.JeAKxaZY6lAFOE.fzz1HL9WRZ5YrZivfz4mO6ZGXXcm4ufubgN5xPVHXP3e8MQt1DYaI9Yb90A--", "site_full": "www.mynordickitchen.no", "site": "mynordickitchen.no", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "title_full": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "published": "2018-03-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.258, "main_image": "http://www.mynordickitchen.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/byggryn-2-of-2-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34bbff9d28642783f9357df66cad59f28458b0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.JeAKxaZY6lAFOE.fzz1HL9WRZ5YrZivfz4mO6ZGXXcm4ufubgN5xPVHXP3e8MQt1DYaI9Yb90A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "text": "Primary Sidebar With love from Oslo \nHi! I am so happy you are here! My name is Therese Elstad and welcome to My Nordic Kitchen from Oslo, Norway.

The recipes you will find on this blog will be plant-based, nutritious and greatly inspired by the Nordic areas surrounding me with inspiration from the rest of the world. Food is something that affects everyone, no matter who and where you are. We should therefore all have enough knowledge about food to be able to live a long and happy life. It should not be a burden- nor should it be boring. Food should be something that makes you thrive to be able to live the life you want, it should bring people together in the most wonderful way and last but not least- it should be fun.
