His Bulgarian colleague Boyko Borissov announced that next years\u2019 summit will take place in Sofia.\nReuters reported earlier this month that China was considering paring back the summits, although China says preparatory talks for this year\u2019s summit in Bulgaria are continuing.

Meanwhile, Penguin, Lee, and Nygma enlist an unlikely ally as they seek revenge, and Selina asks Bruce for a favor to help rid her of her guilt over Ivy. \nReview: This episode is a bit of a race against time. Gordon and Bullock have reformed the band and are after an informant that could help them nail Sofia Falcone. Penguin, Nygma, and Lee are racing to kill Falcone for their revenge. While Falcone is trying to multitask by hopefully killing Penguin, but also going after Gordon\u2019s informant. Yes, it gets really complicated from here on in folks. Thankfully Falcone has the help of Victor Zsasz and his sidekick, but that doesn\u2019t seem to do her a lot of good. \nThe lesser stories in this weeks episode see Selina seeking Bruce Wayne\u2019s help in alleviating her guilt. Which allows for Bruce to open a can of Bad Ass and beat up some crooked pawnbrokers who are acting as a fence. \nWe also see Barbara having terrible migraine headaches, which may or may not have something to do with the pending return of Ra\u2019s al Ghul. \nStorywise this episode had a lot of moving parts, but it allowed for Lee to grow into an even meaner criminal than she was trying to be. Thankfully she still has a soft spot for Jim Gordon because she saves his life after he is shot several times by Sofia. \nTalking of Sofia. She is now in a coma. Apparently being shot in the head does that to you. In fact, Bullock tells Jim that is it is amazing that Sofia is still alive. Are you shitting me? I mean Lee shot her between the eyes at what must have been pretty close to point blank. How in hell is she still alive. Does she have her brains elsewhere? I mean I know this is all based on a comic book, but there are limits. Butch surviving being shot and soaked in toxic waste to become Solomon grundy limits. \nOverall. This was a pretty solid episode right up to the revelation that Sofia had survived a gunshot wound to the head. I can understand why the writers would want to bring her back. I mean Sofia Falcone plays really well with the other female villains on the show and her scenes with Lee have had an extra bit of sizzle. So don\u2019t be surprised if Sofia is up and about by the close of the series. As for Lee. Who knew that she\u2019d turn into such a bad ass.
