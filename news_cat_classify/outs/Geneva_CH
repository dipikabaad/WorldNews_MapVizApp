The review of Lebanon, which had started on 15 March, could not be completed as scheduled due to a strike called for by the United Nations staff at the United Nations Office at Geneva on 16 March. The review resumed on 22 March with the participation of Lebanon by a video conference from Beirut, and in the presence of the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva. Presenting the report, Salim Baddoura, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, informed the Committee of the adoption of a new electoral law which recognized the right to vote of the Lebanese diaspora; the next election would be held on May 16 and would see many new candidates running including more than a hundred women. In the face of a massive influx of Syrian refugees - an estimated 1.5 million joined the already large Palestinian diaspora - Lebanon refused to heed the calls to resort to a state of emergency and intended to remain a model in the region. An independent National Human Rights Commission had been established in accordance with the Paris Principles, and a standing commission against torture would be set up as well. A bill to protect whistle-blowers was being drafted, and Lebanon was also developing a personal status bill which would recognize the right not to declare religion and the right to embrace another religion, and would repeal some outdated provisions, such as the prohibition for a Lebanese woman to transmit the nationality to her children. The marriage under the age of 18 would soon be prohibited, said the head of the delegation, urging the Committee to consider the situation of the country in assessing whether the efforts in this regard were sufficient. Noting that it had been twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, Committee Experts started the interactive dialogue by praising the country for hosting more than one million Syrian refugees and assuming a burden which strained its infrastructure. They commended positive legal reforms including criminalization of torture and the new electoral law, and said that challenges related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and the country\u2019s cultural and religious pluralism continued to persist. While recognizing realities of domestic political instability and the regional geopolitical situation, Experts were nevertheless concerned by lack of action to overcome the confessional political system and asked about efforts to combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance. They urged Lebanon to address the reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including children; improve conditions of detention, alleviate overcrowding, and investigate abuses happening within prison walls. While Lebanon had made efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end had not yet been adopted, Experts remarked. They raised concern about the still unknown fate of the more than 17,000 people who had been disappeared between 1975-1990, and the comprehensive impunity in this area - there had been no prosecution relating to enforced disappearance to date. Discrimination against women continued as personal status laws created barriers to their equality in matters of marriage, divorce, custody and alimony, and Lebanon still lacked a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would include a definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination, and a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the Covenant. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Baddoura thanked the Committee for a courteous discussion which would hopefully represent a milestone in the cooperation between Lebanon and the Committee. Margo Waterwal, Committee Rapporteur, in her concluding statement, thanked the delegation of Lebanon in Geneva and in Beirut for their flexibility. The delegation of Lebanon consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of State to the Women Affairs, Ministry of State to the Human Rights Affairs, Ministry of State for the Displaced Affairs, the National Commission for Lebanese Women, and the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Committee will issue its concluding observations and recommendations on the report of Lebanon towards the end of its session, which concludes on 6 April 2018. All the documents relating to the Committee\u2019s work, including reports submitted by States parties, can be found on the session\u2019s webpage . The webcast of the Committee\u2019s public meetings is available at UN Web TV . The Committee will next meet in public at 10 a.m. on Monday, 26 March to discuss the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on the follow-up to the concluding observations, and the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on follow-up to views. Report The Committee is considering the third periodic report of Lebanon ( CCPR/C/LBN/3 ). Presentation of Report SALIM BADDOURA, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, started by reassuring the Committee of the commitment of his country to its international obligations. The electoral law recognized the right to vote of the Lebanese diaspora and the next election was to be held on May 16, in which many new candidates were standing, including more than a hundred women. The new Government had established a Ministry of Human Rights and a Ministry for Women. Mr. Baddoura stressed that in the face of a massive influx of Syrian refugees, in which an estimated 1.5 million had joined the already large Palestinian diaspora, Lebanon refused to heed the calls to resort to a state of emergency and intended to remain a model in the region. An independent National Human Rights Commission had been established in accordance with the Paris Principles, and Lebanon intended to set up a standing commission against torture. Lebanon had ratified the Convention against Torture and had submitted its first report to the treaty body responsible for its implementation. A bill to protect whistle-blowers was being drafted, said the Ambassador, and informed the Committee that sanctions had been imposed on law enforcement officers who had used disproportionate violence during demonstrations. The right not to declare religion or to embrace another religion was envisaged in the framework of a personal status bill, which at the moment was not unified. The bill would repeal some outdated provisions, such as a prohibition for a Lebanese woman to transmit her nationality. Lebanese women occupied a growing place in the world of work, including in senior positions in the public and private sectors, emphasized Mr. Baddoura. There was a system in place to enable women victims of violence to seek reparations. The law prohibited modern slavery and trafficking in human beings; a strategy was in place to improve the border control in this context, while bilateral agreements had been concluded with countries of origin of migrant workers. The marriage under the age of 18 would soon be prohibited, said the head of the delegation, urging the Committee to consider the situation of the country in assessing whether the efforts in this regard were sufficient. The Lebanese State was serious about developing its capabilities and was committed to respecting its international obligations, reiterated the Ambassador and went on to reassure the Committee that the civil society, whose activity was vital, could act and express itself freely. The authorities worked in cooperation with the civil society on the basis of shared values, he said and concluded by expressing hope that the dialogue with the Committee Experts would be constructive. Questions by Committee Experts A Committee Expert remarked at the beginning of the interactive dialogue that it had been twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, and then praised Lebanon for its approach to Syrian refugees, noting that, since the outbreak of the crisis in Syria, Lebanon had hosted more than one million refugees and asylum seekers, assuming a burden which strained its infrastructure. The Expert commended the State party for initiating positive legal reforms such as the adoption of legislation establishing a national human rights institution and a national preventive mechanism for torture; the criminalization of torture and the adoption of a new Electoral law. Challenges still remained, however, related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and the country\u2019s cultural and religious pluralism. The Expert had concerns about the status of the Covenant in the domestic legal order and its relation with the Lebanese Constitution. He asked the delegation to cite examples of case law where the Covenant had been invoked before national courts, and to explain steps taken to raise awareness about the Covenant in the judicial and legislative milieu. To ensure that the National Human Rights Institution became operative, the Expert inquired whether members had been appointed, what its budget was and under what mandate it operated. Lebanon planned to overcome its confessional political system however no action had been taken due to the domestic political instability and the geopolitical situation in the region. The Expert recalled that during the visit to the country in 2015, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief had taken note of the cautious approach to preserve the interreligious balance in various social spheres to ensure stability, and wondered whether such an approach could also lead to discrimination in various social spheres. What educational measures would be taken to combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance? Discussing the discrimination of women, civil society submissions flagged the continuing discrimination against women in the various personal status laws, for example in erecting greater barriers for women who wished to terminate their marriage, initiate divorce proceedings, ensure their rights concerning their children after divorce or secure pecuniary rights from former spouses. Had measures been taken to ensure equal treatment of women in the personal status laws? What were the plans concerning the adoption of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would include a definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination, and a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the Covenant, as well as an open-ended list of prohibited grounds related to social status and gender identity and orientation? What remedies were available to victims of discrimination? Lebanon should amend the Constitution to include a minimum list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, Experts urged. The Committee was concerned about the reports of a rise in arrests under article 534, which were based on physical characteristics or dress, and in fact targeted the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community. Although Lebanon had stated that prison sentences for members of those communities were more lenient, and even if they were only given a fine, it remained on their records for three to five years. Persons were harassed and attacked on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and for the most part were not protected by the police. Seminars to mark the day against homophobia in Beirut, were met with threats by the Association of Muslim Scholars, which posted threats on Facebook; rather than protecting the individuals, the authorities cancelled the events. What were the measures taken to protect persons subjected to discrimination and violence, including hate speech, on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity? Would Lebanon consider adopting hate crime legislation and abolishing article 534 completely? Another issue of concern was the persistence of discriminatory legal provisions and practices which prevented women from fully enjoying their rights, especially in the personal status law, nationality law and penal code. Women were poorly represented in political life and legislative bodies although there were no explicit obstacles to their participation in these institutions. With regards to violence against women, what was the status of the amendment to law 239 which the Ministry of Justice had proposed to strengthen the protection of survivors of domestic violence, and did it include also marital rape? The Experts also raised issues concerning sexual harassment in the workplace, corporal punishment of children and the age for contracting marriage, and asked about shelters for victims of violence. There were reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and also reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including children. Was arbitrary detention a common practice and what legal safeguards were in place for all persons deprived of liberty? While Lebanon had made efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end had not yet been adopted. No executions had been carried out since 2004, however the national human rights action plan to adopt the moratorium on the death penalty had not been implemented. Experts stressed that the right to demand a pardon on the particular circumstances of the case could not replace the judicial authority of whether or not to impose the death penalty. The Committee was pleased to see the institution of a Prison Refurbishment program, yet there was still a trend of prison overcrowding, with certain centres having a more than 185 per cent occupancy rate. Between 2012 and 2016, 81 people lost their lives in detention centres of \u201cnatural\u201d causes; hygiene conditions remained poor and there were reports of abuse by prison guards. Lebanon must improve conditions of detention, take steps to alleviate overcrowding, investigate abuses happening within their walls, and ensure that refugees and immigrant populations were held separately. There were more than 17,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Lebanon between 1975-1990, and reports of secret places of detention; yet, there had been no prosecution relating to forced disappearance to date. Impunity in this area was comprehensive, Experts said, reminding Lebanon that the right of families to know what happened to their members was enshrined in international human rights laws. A number of mass graves had been identified but only one had been exhumed with the identification of bodies. Did Lebanon have plans to exhume the others and identify the bodies and thus give closure to families? The criminalization of abortion was connected with religious beliefs and therapeutic abortion was only practiced if the life of the mother was in danger. The criminalization pushed some 40,000 women every year towards unsafe abortions at a great risk to their health, and significantly increasing maternal mortality rates. The law protected a person\u2019s right not to be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and Lebanon had broadened the scope of legal protection by ratifying the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in line with the provisions of article 7 or the Covenant. On October 26, 2017 the Chamber of Deputies had approved a draft act that criminalized the offence of torture, including a definition of the offence of torture, Experts said and remarked that it fell short of Lebanon\u2019s obligations under international law. Lebanese law also contained a set of rules aimed at ensuring that prisoners were treated with humanity. Preventive and punitive measures had been adopted and conditions for detainees held in Lebanese prisons were improving. Yet there were still concerns. Statistics showed that 60 per cent of persons arrested in Lebanon for over a year were subjected to torture and serious ill treatments, 52 per cent of female detainees were also victims of torture. Detained refugees were forced to sign a statement confirming their voluntary repatriation to their country of origin after being tortured. Children and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons were also subject to torture. What was the State party doing to address torture in prisons? What rights did the prisoners have? Responses by the Delegation In response to Experts\u2019 questions related to the constitutional and legal framework, a delegate said that the Constitution attached special importance to the Covenant, as reflected in its preamble. A number of judicial rulings had invoked the Covenant on political and civil rights, for example in the area of asylum law. Judges and prosecutors received continuing professional education, which included human rights training, said the delegate noting that the bar association in Beirut held at least one session per year on the principles and provisions of the Covenant. In addition, four or five years ago, Lebanese universities had adopted a decision on including human rights in the curricula in all sectors and faculties of academic training and universities. Non-discrimination and gender equality was the subject of a number of questions and comments, said a delegate, reiterating that the Lebanese civil law drew no distinctions between men and women. Women could take up positions on an equal footing with men, in the diplomatic corps, judiciary and public service, said a delegate. Religious law did not seek to oppress women; it provided everyone with their rights while civil law covered areas not covered by personal status laws which were based on a person\u2019s religious denomination. Referring to the 2014 Domestic Violence Act, certain amendments were being debated in Parliament with a law on early marriage and the movement of minors. With regard to civil marriage, there was a strong trend toward adopting a law concerning this but it was hampered because of the political situation. The law did not recognize marriage of Lebanese citizens abroad. The National Strategy for Women had been adopted in 2012 to ensure their equal treatment in all walks of life. Looking at the law, the media, social activism and training, efforts had been made in those domains regarding the progress of women\u2019s rights. There was a strategic aim to ensure equal rights and obligations for men and women. The Media Act raised the media\u2019s awareness to women\u2019s condition in Lebanon. Educational opportunities were equal between girls and boys but there were also efforts to integrate more women in the education system. With regard to health, continued the delegate, men and women equally accessed reproductive health rights and health care. The Government was currently amending laws that discriminated against women\u2019s economic and commercial rights. Many campaigns had been launched that insisted in including women in electoral lists. There were efforts now for Lebanese women to pass their nationality to their children. Procedures were being adopted to give residency rights to spouses of Lebanese people as well. Civil society organizations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons were invited to participate in activities organized by the National Human Rights Institution, said the delegation, emphasizing that everyone had the right to bring a legal case regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Specialized tribunals had handed down four judgments under article 504 of the penal law. Laws guaranteed sexual freedoms but there was no security campaign in place to protect those individuals in the private domain. As for violence against women, amendments to the law protecting women and families in a public space, had been submitted for approval in Parliament. Those amendments would indeed allow for the criminalization of marital rape. The law held that violence against women with a view to having sexual relations constituted aggravating circumstances. It was also compatible with international laws and instruments. There was a bill before Parliament, which sought to criminalize sexual harassment in the workplace and in the public sphere. A number of measures had been taken to address violence against women, said the delegation. Internal security forces had created a specialized centre for victims of domestic violence to receive complaints and ensure their temporary shelter while those complaints were investigated. A special prosecutor for intra-family violence was in place, and in cooperation with civil society, the police were trained in dealing with domestic violence and the victims. Victims of violence could always call on the support of a provisional, secret shelter. A new electoral law had been adopted in 2017 which required representation of all societal categories with particular emphasis on female candidates. There was an accelerated approach to establish human rights training in military spheres in Lebanon. Torture and other conflicts with international humanitarian law cases were reviewed in cooperation with other governmental bodies. Speaking on the death penalty, the delegation emphasized that the laws governing it were in line with the Covenant, as the capital punishment was only used for the most serious crimes. It was important to understand that the use of the death penalty required a decree on the part of the executive, stressed the delegate, noting that the death penalty had not been used since 2004. Judges were allowed to transmute the death penalty to life in prison on the condition that the victim\u2019s family was informed and received reparations. The dialogue with the delegation of Lebanon continued on 22 March via a video conference from Beirut; representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva were present in the room. Responses by Delegates With regard to questions of confessionalism, with roots dating back to Ottoman times, the delegation said that Lebanese society was multi-denominational, with 18 different religious communities recognized by the State. Each of these communities has its own personal status rules that applied only to its members. This confessional diversity was also reflected in the political system and the distribution of certain public functions. Faith diversity was considered one of the guarantors of coexistence as it ensured the protection of the specificity of each community and ensured its active participation in governance and public administration. It might seem legitimate to think that taking into account the confessional diversity in governance and administration had the effect of limiting the application of the principle of equal rights for all Lebanese, noted the delegate, since confessional membership could constitute a discriminatory element among the Lebanese. Moreover, the State committed, within the framework of the preamble of the Constitution, to the abolition of political confessionalism, but it had done almost nothing in this sense, because of the political and security instability. Already under the Ottoman Empire, confessionalism had ensured all Lebanese communities the enjoyment of a certain number of rights. With independence, a mixed \u2013 hybrid \u2013 system of governance had been put in place, in which confessionalism and democracy were mixed. Community identity did not stand in the way of national identity, stressed the delegate; when a soldier fell in the fight against terrorism or a hostile foreign state, when a judge made a verdict, they did not do so by virtue of the values \u200b\u200bof their confession. The constitutional amendments under the Ta\u2019if Agreement represented a stability of power, upholding the social fabric of Lebanon and the responsibility of all. Since 2008, every citizen could demand that the mention of his or her denominational membership be omitted from the registers of civil status, or be deleted. According to the inventory of the Directorate General of Personal Status of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, about 300 people had used this provision in 2016. The criminalization of torture had been effective at all levels according to international law. Lebanese law recognized torture in all circumstances and stipulated various levels of punishment which was proportional to the torture inflicted, and it also granted courts the rights to offer rehabilitation to torture victims. About 60 complaints of torture had been lodged in 2017, which resulted in sanctions for some 40 officers. The Committee Against Torture had been created under the Paris Principles and was tasked with investigating, reporting, and educating about human rights. The Committee visited detention centres in a random fashion and spoke with detainees concerning their conditions. They also gathered information from Lebanese administrative authorities and received recommendations on improving those detention centres. There also had to be a sufficient budget to cover the mandate, which would be part of the budget finance package of 2018. Referring to fundamental guarantees for detainees, community police had been adopted as part of the \u201ctogether towards a safer society\u201d, programme, whose goals were based on four objectives: safety, bolstering partnerships with society, accountability and human rights, and raising the level of professional expertise. Members of this body were trained and conducted programs and visited prisons, thus developing criteria to assure the conduct of those visits. Article 1 of the Convention against Torture was also adopted and integrated into Lebanese legislation, further protecting prisoners\u2019 rights, and a complaint mechanism was in place with cameras installed to monitor detention centres. The conditions of detention centres, said a delegate, in light of the surge of refugees, were overcrowded. To cope with that increase, new prisons were constructed in the north of Lebanon and the central Roumieh prison also had a new centre as well as a new juvenile detention centre. A commission to tackle poor prison conditions was to be established as well as investigate alternative means to confinement. There was also the complete separation of juveniles from adult detainees. There were 23 prisons in Lebanon suffering from overcrowding. They were working on programs to rehabilitate prisoners as well, and reintegrate them in society. In terms of pre-trial detention, the legal system required that people detained for longer than 72 hours be registered, and article 47 of the criminal procedure code reminded the detainee of their rights to contact a lawyer and to have an interpreter. According to this article, arrested people could only be held for 48 hours, prolonged only with the accord of the attorney general. Under Decree 6236, the International Committee of the Red Cross could regularly visit thirteen prisons so independent investigations could be carried out about prison conditions and treatment of detainees. With regards to enforced disappearances, a delegate said that the Ministry for Human Rights was in consultations with civil society organizations and victims\u2019 families, while the future protocol with the International Committee of the Red Cross, already approved by the Ministry of Justice, would enable the collection of the DNA from family members to help with the identification of the disappeared. The right to knowing the fate of their family members would be enshrined in law, while a national committee established to this effect would have centralized archives to help detect the locations where those persons had been buried, essentially in mass graves. Abortion was prohibited and therapeutic abortion was allowed only if the mother\u2019s life was at risk; outside this scope, a judge might grant abortion under \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d recognize the concept of \u201chonour crimes\u201d, but there had been a provision in the Criminal Code which had allowed it. The Chamber of Deputies had repealed in 2011 that article which had granted extenuating circumstances to the person killing or mistreating his wife, one of his ascendants or descendants or his sister because of adultery or unlawful sexual intercourse. Questions by Committee Experts In the continuation of the interactive dialogue, an Expert said that although there were no secret detention centres under the Ministry of Defence, there were allegations that such centres existed, and that children were detained, and even died there. The labour law excluded migrant workers\u2014primarily women\u2014from its provisions and placed them under the sponsorship system, also known as the kafala, which gave absolute control of the employer over the status of the migrant employee, and making migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Lebanon hosted a huge number of refugees and provided continued aid to those refugees despite the burden they placed on the country, Experts noted with satisfaction and asked about the regulations in place that resulted in the restricted access to asylum procedures and push-backs at the border with Syria. There were reportedly 20 cases of refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly Iraqi and Sudanese nationals, who had been deported from detention centres in 2017. Would the State Party adopt domestic framework for asylum or adhere to the 1951 Refugee Convention? There were also reports that refugees and asylum seekers were subjected to prolonged administrative detention and subjected to expulsion. How many migrants, refugees and asylum seekers were detained, on what grounds and how many among them were children? The mass surveillance of digital communications by the State Party had been reported, said an Expert, and that surveillance and subsequent interception of personal data was not compatible with the Covenant. Law 140 required prior judicial authorization for any interception of private communications and access to data but the Lebanese Prime Minister had the authority to circumvent this Law. The Expert asked if this surveillance was subject to independent oversight mechanisms and if Law 140 would be amended to ensure greater protection. The Committee expressed concerned about the lack of judicial independence and the absence of effective means for appeals. What was the status of the bill aimed at ensuring the independence of the judiciary? Three bills concerning the abolition of military courts were currently being discussed in Parliament \u2013 would they touch on the lack of the independence of judges or the use of the courts to impress political adversaries and suppress dissenting voices? The use of confessions extracted under torture, for example, was not considered grounds for appeal; civil society organizations documented at least eight cases where individuals had their confessions, given while under torture, were used against them in court. The Committee considered that defamation should be de-criminalized and the criminal code be reserved for only the most serious crimes. Provisions in the Code allowed for imprisonment for anyone who, for example, insulted the President or the flag, which was extreme. With regard to the right to access information, the Committee commended Lebanon on drafting that law as well as the update of a draft law that protected whistle-blowers in cases of corruption. The Constitution guaranteed the right to assembly, however during some demonstrations, including the 2015 protests related to the waste collection crisis and corruption and impunity for such acts, excessive force by security authorities had been used. When and how was force used by the authorities and were they trained on situations where using force was necessary? Experts were concerned about numerous reports of forced marriages among Syrian refugee girls and women, as well as rural women in Lebanon. What were the intentions concerning decriminalising consenting sexual relations between adults irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity? Could members of non-registered religious groups stand as candidates for election at national or local levels and what were the opportunities for their political and public participation? What concrete measures, including quotas or voluntary quotas, would be put in place to increase women\u2019s presence in decision-making positions? Lebanon continued to observe a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, but an Expert asked for clarifications on how many people had been killed by the death penalty. According to Article 24 of the Covenant, said the Expert, all children must be immediately registered after birth and were required to given a nationality. Still, many children in the country were stateless at birth, particularly refugee children. What was being done to simplify the birth registration procedure and what rights to nationality did children born to stateless parents had? Responses by the Selegation Responding to the question about the deportation of migrants, the delegation explained that the principle of non-refoulement was fully respected by the authorities: no person could be expelled if there was the slightest doubt that he or she could be subjected to torture in his country. Regarding privacy and censorship, intelligence interception did not interfere with private life. A safe Lebanon was a secure Lebanon, the delegation said, but using this intelligence was only in the interests of fighting terrorism and protecting Lebanon and its people. Regarding freedom of expression, the law stipulated that all audiovisual recordings must be controlled. The existence of a code of conduct that had classified artistic works was not contrary to freedom of expression; the broadcast of works that focused on Lebanon\u2019s diversity were encouraged and violent extremism, terrorism and hate speech were censored. An audiovisual bill was under consideration, and it would repeal prison sentences that can be used against newspapers. Domestic workers were protected by the law of obligations and contracts, as well as by the Criminal Procedure Code. Any mistreatment or withholding of salaries by employer could be lodged with a disciplinary board within the Ministry of Labour. To provide fair and equitable working conditions and to protect women from abuse and violence, the labour law required employers to give equal salaries to migrant workers, to be paid at the end of every month through a bank transfer or money wire. The workers were provided with 24 hours off and a 15-day annual leave as well as nine consecutive hours of rest per day. A guide published in the native language of foreign workers was given to them as soon as they arrived in the country. Audiovisual campaigns had been developed to raise awareness of employers concerning their obligations. \nTrade unions had a wide margin of freedom in Lebanon and a prohibition against social servants to hold a strike was now a theoretical thing. Protests had been held in 2017 to raise their wages, for example. Ad hoc or military courts had been created in 1968; they comprised 27 judges appointed by the Ministry of Justice and High Judicial Council. With regard to investigating minors in military courts, it was done in the presence of a juvenile protection delegate and they were only tried if they perpetrated a crime with adults; otherwise they were referred to a juvenile court. It was compulsory to have a defence council present in military court during the proceedings. Defence council would be appointed if the accused could not provide one. The delegation categorically denied the existence of secret detention centers and said that facts would be welcome, not allegations. The jury was an independent authority and all judgements were issued in the name of the Lebanese people, as consecrated in the Constitution. Draft laws promoting the independence of the judiciary were being discussed in Parliament and focused on the mechanism to appoint judges, how to appoint members of the Supreme Council and the budget of the judiciary. Lebanon had for the first time a Ministry dedicated to fighting corruption, and was responsible for, inter alia, illicit enrichment, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. A national strategy against corruption was in the process of implementation. Regarding birth registration, it was possible to register a child under the name of the Lebanese father or mother or both within 12 months of birth. It was also possible to register children of foreign parents born in Lebanon. A special mechanism had been put in place for the registration of Syrian children, even those older than 12 months; the mechanism also covered Palestinian refugees from Syria. The delegation said that 63 people had been sentenced to death. A draft law on early marriage removed the possibility for different denominations to set their own age of marriage, which would not be 18 years old; the new law would allow 16 years old to marry subsequent to the authorization of the parents and social entourage. A judicial authorization was required for the administration to register a marriage of a minor. The law also introduced penal sanctions for non-compliance and awareness campaigns for young girls to inform them that they could refuse to marry before the age of 18 was in place. Conferences and debated had been organized and a sub-committee had been established to deal with the political activity of women. There had been an increase in women\u2019s participation in decision-making positions because of those efforts. \nConcluding Remarks \nSALIM BADDOURA, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in his closing remarks thanked the Committee for a courteous discussion which would hopefully represent a milestone in the cooperation between Lebanon and this Committee. The Ambassador also noted with satisfaction the goodwill and flexibility which allowed for the completion of this interactive dialogue regardless of the strike by the United Nations personnel on 16 March.

Artists from all over the world are invited, through our cultural programmes, to spend time at CERN and work alongside particle physicists and engineers. \nToday, we announce the winners of Collide International and Collide Geneva. Both awards offer a fully funded residency of up to three months to one artist in each category in order to research new ideas and crossovers between artistic practice and scientific research at the largest particle laboratory in the world. \n\"Arts at CERN aims to break down the silos between arts and science, helping us to understand the world around us from different perspectives. It enriches all of us when barriers are overcome and new knowledge is enabled. We are grateful to all the participants in Collide International and Collide Geneva for helping us towards this goal and congratulate them on their achievements,\" says Charlotte Lindberg Warakaulle, CERN\u2019s Director for International Relations. \nCollide International is a three-month residency programme in collaboration with the UK\u2019s Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT) that provides a fully funded residency of up to two months at CERN and a month at FACT in Liverpool. A jury of experts in art and science selected Suzanne Treister as the winner of the international award. She will undertake a residency during spring 2018 to further develop her investigation \u2018Holographic Universe\u2019 and explore the artist\u2019s motivations and intentions through the history of art, from cave painting to modernism and global contemporary art, including outsider and psychedelic art, passing through the art of the ancient world, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Islamic art and the European Renaissance. Taiwanese artist Yu-Chen Wang and Danish artist Lea Porsager received Honorary Mentions this year and will be invited to CERN for a short visit as Guest Artists in 2018. \nThe Collide Geneva award was dedicated to performance and was assigned to the artists Anne Sylvie Henchoz and Julie Lang. They will spend three months at CERN during the autumn of 2018 further developing their project \u2018Space Time Energy\u2019 around the potential analogies between the human body and particles. Collide Geneva is a partnership between Arts at CERN, the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the City of Geneva to foster research on artistic expression and fundamental research. \n\" Today, artists from all over the world are invited to CERN, through our programmes, to explore new ideas and work alongside particle physicists and engineers.

Holding in-depth discussions about root causes and best practices will help us to make progress toward eradicating these unacceptable  ,\u201d said Victor Madrigal-Borloz, the United Nations Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender diversity. \nThe dialogue is taking place with the support of the Office of   Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. \nENDS \nFor more information and media requests, please contact: \nOHCHR: Michael van Gelderen (+41 22 928 9355 / mvangelderen@ohchr.org ) \nIACHR: Ms. Maria Isabel Rivero (+1 202 370 9001/ mrivero@oas.org )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "flavia piovesan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "inter-american commission on human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african commission on human and peoples\u2019 rights and united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T19:23:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3d5ea33858e56085b92b14adae465570e53f5f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6l3LBGBX1dXKQoyk_vVqD0oLt5xbXcnBGe.YkZdUy7D3LoKABfyq1_5YEHHttBMZXi6d2uS6yHDPE.n6Zy4VvozKecLvl5i4bMRWe4Nwisg--", "site_full": "www.finews.com", "site": "finews.com", "site_section": "http://www.finews.com/news/english-news?format=feed&type=atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "finews.com: Latest Headlines, Breaking News and Top Stories", "title": "Swiss Consultancy Looks to Asia", "title_full": "Swiss Consultancy Looks to Asia", "published": "2018-03-22T23:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.finews.com/images/news/2018/03/Mike-Coady-503.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3d5ea33858e56085b92b14adae465570e53f5f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6l3LBGBX1dXKQoyk_vVqD0oLt5xbXcnBGe.YkZdUy7D3LoKABfyq1_5YEHHttBMZXi6d2uS6yHDPE.n6Zy4VvozKecLvl5i4bMRWe4Nwisg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "finews.com (info@finews.com)", "published": "2018-03-22T23:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Swiss Consultancy Looks to Asia", "text": "Print Mike Coady, Swiss Global Group \nSwiss Global Group, a Geneva-based financial services firm planning an Asian expansion, has named a global sales head. \nA Swiss financial planning and advisory firm with offices in Geneva, Zurich and Basel outlined plans to expand into the Middle East and Asia.

The Council adopted resolutions to extend by a period of one year the mandates of   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic,   situation of human rights in Iran, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and   situation of human rights in Myanmar. In a resolution adopted without a vote, the Council decided to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea for a period of one year, and it requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide a full report at the Council\u2019s fortieth session on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts regarding accountability. By a vote of 27 in favour, four against and 16 abstentions, the Council decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and it requested the Commission of Inquiry to provide it with an oral update at its thirty-eighth session, as well as to present an updated written report at its thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions. The Council decided by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions, to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Iran for a further period of one year, and it requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the mandate at the Council\u2019s fortieth session and to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. In a resolution adopted without a vote, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for a period of one year, and it requested the Commission to present an oral update at the Council\u2019s thirty-ninth session, and to present a comprehensive written report at the Council\u2019s fortieth session. By a vote of 32 in favour, five against and 10 abstentions, the Council decided to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Myanmar for a further period of one year, and it requested the Special Rapporteur to present an oral progress report at the Council\u2019s thirty-eighth session, and to submit a report to the Third Committee at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly and to the Council at its fortieth session. Introducing draft texts were Bulgaria   Japan, United Kingdom, Qatar, Russian Federation, Sweden on behalf of a group of countries, and United States. Syria, Iran, South Sudan and Myanmar spoke as concerned countries, while Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was not present in the room to take the floor as a concerned country. Australia, Slovakia   Switzerland, Iraq, Belgium, Venezuela, United States, and Pakistan spoke in general comments. Cuba, Venezuela, China, Australia, Egypt, Mexico on behalf of a group of countries, Cuba, Brazil, Pakistan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, Philippines, United States, and Kyrgyzstan spoke in explanation of the vote. The Council at 3 p.m. will continue taking action on resolutions and decisions before it closes its thirty-seventh session. Action on Resolutions under the Agenda Item on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council\u2019s Attention Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.29 ) on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea , adopted without a vote, the Council reiterates the request\u2026 to the High Commissioner to provide a full report at its fortieth session on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability in its report to the Council; and decides to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 34/24 for a period of one year. The Council urges the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, through continuous dialogues, to invite and to cooperate fully with all special procedure mandate holders, especially   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to give the Special Rapporteur and supporting staff unrestricted access to visit the country, and to provide them with all information necessary to enable them to fulfil such a mandate, and also to promote technical cooperation with the  . Bulgaria, introducing the draft resolution L.28   said for a decade, the European Union and Japan had been at the forefront of bringing the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to the attention of the Human Rights Council, starting with the creation of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, and later with the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry whose landmark report had been released four years ago. Despite recent high-level talks held between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea being an encouraging signal and a positive step toward the improvement of inter-Korean relations, the European Union and Japan remained deeply concerned by the human rights situation, with on-going, systematic and widespread gross human rights violations taking place in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, some of which might amount to crimes against humanity. It was in the common responsibility as the international community and as members of the Council to ensure that this precarious human rights situation continued to receive the attention it deserved. The draft resolution aimed to address the most pertinent issues related to the human rights situation, and it welcomed steps to strengthen the capacity of the   for Human Rights, including its field-based structure in Seoul. Japan, also introducing the draft resolution L.29, said the text recalled last year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly resolution that underscored very serious concerns regarding reports of abductions and other forms of human rights violations. The international community must continue to maximize pressure on, and strongly urge, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to take concrete steps for cooperation with the international community and for the early resolution of the abductions issue. The draft resolution would continue to encourage the   for Human Rights to expedite the process of strengthening its capacity and it welcomed the recent steps taken to this end. The draft resolution also decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for another year. Japan called on the Member States of the Council to support the adoption of this draft resolution by consensus, as had been done the previous year. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, was not in the room to take the floor as the concerned country. Cuba, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, noted that the draft resolution was a confrontational step taken towards the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. As a position of principle, Cuba objected to country-specific mandates as those violated the principles of non-politicization that should be the real principle of this Council. The road of respectful dialogue and non-selectivity, and respect of sovereignty of States, was the only way to resolve human rights concerns. Adopting resolutions like this one would not contribute to the mandate of the Council and Cuba could not support such resolutions. The draft resolution did not provide added value and would not achieve any progress in current issues facing the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, reiterated that the draft text was promoting policy against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and stressed that the decision on measures concerning the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea must include the country itself. Since this was not the case, Venezuela objected to such an approach and dissociated itself from the resolution. China, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, stressed that human rights problems should be resolved through dialogue, and the promotion of a healthy human rights cause. The situation in the Korean Peninsula had recently experienced positive change, and China hoped that all parties would contribute to the amelioration of the situation. The draft text did not promote such an objective and China could not support the draft resolution by consensus. The Council adopted the draft proposal without a vote. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Syrian Arab Republic In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.38 ) on the human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic , adopted by a vote of 27 in favour, 4 against and 16 abstentions, the Council calls upon all Member States, especially members of the International Syria Support Group, to make renewed efforts to create conditions, including a comprehensive nationwide ceasefire, that support continued negotiations for a political solution to the Syrian conflict, under the auspices of the United Nations Office at Geneva, as only a durable political solution to the conflict can bring an end to the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law. The Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the continued use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic..., and expresses its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable; also recalls the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, and expresses grave concern at its findings that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the use of sarin on 4 April, 2017 in Khan Sheikhoun; and expresses grave concern at numerous continuing allegations of the use of chemical weapons in recent months and weeks, including in Idlib Province and Eastern Ghouta. The Council invites Member States to support actively the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, including by considering the provision of information and data on the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to provide adequate financial means for its functioning; and demands that all parties work towards a genuine political transition, including through the establishment of an inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers, and urgently work towards the comprehensive implementation of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), within the framework of the United Nations-led intra-Syrian talks in Geneva. The Council decides to extend for one year the mandate of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic; requests the Commission of Inquiry to provide an oral update   during the interactive dialogue at its thirty-eighth session, and to present an updated written report during an interactive dialogue at the thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions; and decides to transmit all reports and oral updates of the Commission of Inquiry to all relevant bodies of the United Nations, recommends that the General Assembly submit the reports to the Security Council for appropriate action, expresses its appreciation to the Commission for its briefings to members of the Security Council, and recommends the continuation of future briefings. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (27): Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States. Against (4): Burundi, China, Cuba and Venezuela. Abstentions (16): Angola,   Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. United Kingdom, introducing the draft text L.38 on behalf of a group of countries, said the human rights situation in Syria remained as urgent as ever. There was a need to continue shining a spotlight on the terrible events occurring in this country in which the people were enduring the devastating effects of conflict on a daily basis. The draft text had been shaped by the constructive participation of Member States, said the United Kingdom, and highlighted its importance as it renewed the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry. The United Kingdom welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings that the use of unguided bombs in the densely populated area of Atarib market by Russian fixed-wing aircraft might amount to a war crime. Qatar, also introducing the draft resolution L.38, said the text condemned all violations undertaken against the Syrian people and urged the international community to work to end impunity in Syria. The situation on the ground showed once again the disregard of Syria for the relevant United Nations resolutions. Qatar called for the full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 2401. The draft text under consideration condemned the targeting of civilian infrastructure and other atrocities, and stressed that all rights violators must be held accountable. Qatar reiterated the transparent manner in which the text was drafted. Russia, presenting amendment L.60, said that Russia could not support the draft resolution as submitted to the Council. The statement made by the United Kingdom had been excessively emotional and sought to mislead the international community. It was clear that the genuine purpose of this text was not concerned with the humanitarian needs or the needs of the people of Syria, but the desire to achieve politically motivated goals. The text aimed to shield illegal armed groups from responsibility for the crimes they committed - armed groups which the co-sponsors had provided with political, informational and armed support, and which continued to commit crimes, hold civilians hostage, destroy entire groups on the basis of religious and ethnic affiliation, torture women and children, and conduct mass killings. Nonetheless, the co-sponsors of the draft resolution tried to justify before the public opinion the investments and down payments they had made to these armed groups. Sooner or later those who supported jihadists would need to admit the choices they made, said Russia, noting that the draft resolution contained politicized words and distortions, which remained the hallmark of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other co-sponsors of this resolution. One could hardly have a positive view of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into Syria, said Russia, noting that it presented often unjustified and false information; at the same time, the more than $ 2.5 million that had been used by this Commission could have been used to truly protect and promote human rights, for example by providing technical assistance to the Government. The report contained accusations of the use of chemical weapons, but Russia was convinced that once Syria was freed, an impartial investigation must be conducted to investigate from where the illegal armed groups had received the components for the chemical weapons. The same applied for the supply chain of weapons and technology. The States that sponsored the draft resolution did not want to condemn all those who committed crimes and this desire was predicted by their need to protect and shield those who supported these armed groups; if they truly condemned all those who had committed crimes, then there should be no difficulty in accepting the amendment to the paragraph as proposed. The second amendment proposed by Russia was on the Syrian National Dialogue Congress which had taken place at the end of January 2018, and which was a vital part of the reconstruction of Syria. United Kingdom, as the sponsor of the draft resolution, requested a vote on amendment L.60. Australia, speaking in a general comment, noted that the human rights situation in Syria had been appalling for the past seven years, from the initial brutal response to protests in 2011 to the most recent atrocities in Eastern Ghouta. Australia deplored the use of chemical and other indiscriminate weapons, attacks on civilians, denial of humanitarian access, and the use of siege and starvation tactics, and said that the regime bore the responsibility for the suffering it caused to its own people. Surely it was time to say enough was enough, said Australia, recalling that the Security Council resolution 2401 had already requested an immediate ceasefire. Australia urged all sides to find a political solution and extended its support to the Commission of Inquiry. Slovakia, speaking in a general comment   said that the resolution not only condemned violence but also called for an immediate action to implement Security Council resolution 2401, and expressed full support for the United Nations led efforts to secure a political solution. The European Union welcomed the extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, and noted that during the high-level panel on the violation of human rights of Syrian children and the presentation of the report by the Commission of Inquiry, this Council\u2019s session had witnessed heinous violations of human rights in Syria. Security Council resolution 2401 remained largely unobserved due to the continued ground offensive and aerial bombardment as well as deliberate targeting of civilians and medical infrastructure in Eastern Ghouta, by the regime supported by Russia and Iran. The European Union had allocated over \u20ac10.4 billion to date for humanitarian and resilience assistance to the Syrians, and the second Brussels Syria Conference afforded a further opportunity to establish peace. Finally, the European Union urged States to bring to an end the suffering of the Syrian people. Switzerland, speaking in a general comment, remained concerned over all the violations of human rights in Syria and commended the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission of Inquiry and the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism which would allow for their greater cooperation. Switzerland opposed the proposed amendment which attempted to weaken the draft resolution which reaffirmed the central role of the United Nations in promoting peace in Syria. Iraq, in a general comment, said that the world was witnessing the Syrian crisis enter its eighth year. The world must not ignore the adversities and challenges in Syria and it must address the conflict without selectivity in order to develop a comprehensive solution. Iraq had been involved in the consultations on the draft text and had attempted to make it more balanced; however, because the current version would not contribute to bringing an end to the conflict, Iraq would abstain from the vote. Belgium, in a general comment, said that Belgium would oppose the amendment tabled by Russia. The text of the resolution, as it stood, contained strong language condemning terrorism, while Russian proposals had no direct link with human rights and went beyond the currently agreed language in the United Nations. Belgium would vote against the amendment and urged other States to do the same. Venezuela, speaking in a general comment, supported amendment L.60 put forward by Russia and underlined the importance of its paragraph 7 which strongly condemned all terrorist attacks. Venezuela would vote in favour of the proposed amendment. United States, speaking in a general comment, strongly supported the draft resolution and the extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, and welcomed the resolution\u2019s strong condemnation of systematic abuses of human rights carried out by the Syrian Government and its allies. The conflict had led to the displacement of millions of people and the deaths of hundreds of thousands. The Commission of Inquiry had helped to provide necessary documentation to hold those responsible to account. The United States reiterated the call for a political solution to the conflict and called upon all Member States of the Council to support the draft resolution and vote no to the tabled amendment, which the Russian delegation had put forward after failing to participate in either of the two public informal consultations. Refusing to engage in negotiations and then filing last-minute hostile amendments undermined this Council and made a mockery of all those who had participated constructively in the negotiation process. Syria, speaking as the concerned country, said the draft resolution was not an acceptable approach to deal with the situation in the country. Co-sponsors of the draft sought to achieve political goals through the text. Those States had no legitimacy to present a draft on Syria as some continued to occupy parts of Syria or contributed support to terrorists in the country. The draft was an insult to Syria and ignored a long list of crimes committed by other States. The co-sponsors were using unreliable information and the draft lacked neutrality. Syria hoped that those speaking about the suffering of Syrians would address the recent bombings perpetrated by co-sponsors of the draft. The extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry would only serve to prolong the war, said Syria and called on the Council\u2019s Member States to vote against the draft. Action on Amendment L.60 Australia, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, strongly opposed the amendment, which Australia said would introduce new language on terrorism. The draft resolution already condemned all terrorist organizations as designated by the Security Council, and Australia was concerned that the amendment would be used to further justify the horrors on the population of Syria. The amendment also spoke of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress, but did not refer to the negotiated and agreed United Nations Security Council and the Human Rights Council resolutions. Australia agreed on the role of the Special Envoy on Syria appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and regretted that Russia had not proposed its amendment in the two open consultations. Australia would vote no on this amendment and encouraged all other States to do the same. The Council then rejected the amendment L.60, with 8 votes in favour, 25 against and 14 abstentions. Action on Draft Resolution L.38 Egypt, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that Egypt was at a loss of words to express solidarity with the Syrian people who had been paying the price of the conflict for seven years. Egypt closely followed the situation and its impact on the Middle East at large, and said that Egypt usually rejected resolutions under agenda items 4 which were not accepted by the concerned State. The draft resolution continued to be unbalanced, especially when it came to the identification of perpetrators, and was using information from inaccurate sources. There was more than one reference to the International Criminal Court in the text and the position of Egypt in this regard was well-known, and additionally, Egypt had not supported the resolution that had established the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism. For all those reasons, Egypt would abstain from the vote. Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote that was also on behalf of Brazil, Peru and Panama, said that the report of the Commission of Inquiry had demonstrated serious human rights abuses. The draft resolution could have been more balanced and could have reflected different types of responsibilities that all State and non-State actors held. At the same time, Brazil, Peru, Panama and Mexico were concerned about the escalating situation in Syria and the lack of humanitarian access. Thus, those four countries would vote in favour, although they deeply regretted that their proposals had been rejected - they believed all countries should refrain from arms transfer that would further destabilize the region. There was a moral responsibility to reject gains generated from arms sales when such gains were obtained on the expense of lives of civilians. Cuba, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, reiterated its horror at the death of civilians in any circumstances and rejected approaches that singled out one party to the conflict as solely responsible. Interventionist agendas would not lead to a solution of the crisis and Cuba rejected persistent challenges to the territorial integrity of Syria. Cuba reaffirmed its support for a peaceful, just and negotiated solution to the conflict, and requested that the draft resolution be put to a vote, and said it would vote against it. Brazil, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, remained deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Syria and expressed support for the renewal of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry. All Syrians deserved respect for their human rights and human rights violators must be held accountable, stressed Brazil. Noting that the draft text retained imbalances from previous texts, it urged the Human Rights Council to unequivocally condemn the transfer of weapons that was exacerbating the conflict. Brazil also condemned any use of chemical weapons and said it would vote in favour of the draft. Pakistan, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said Pakistan was seriously concerned about the human rights of Syrians. The situation was grave, and the world could not afford a blame game and politicization. Pakistan believed in a solution that would respect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Syria and stressed that the challenges could only be overcome by a Syrian-led coalition. Pakistan also believed in a solution that would condemn violations by all sides. The killing of innocents must end, and for that, an impartial and non-selective approach was needed. There could not be favourites. Finally, Pakistan supported dialogue, and said that all parties must respect international humanitarian and human rights law. Pakistan had participated in the consultations in a constructive manner and had tried to balance the text; because the draft fell short of consensus and would reinforce divisions and not bridge them, Pakistan would refrain from voting for this draft resolution. China, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said China believed that a political solution was a fundamental approach to human rights in Syria and that the discussion should respect the Syrian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The international community should facilitate a political solution, mitigate the situation and combat terrorism. Since the draft resolution did not conform to those principles, it was not conducive to ensuring peace, and China therefore would vote against. Ecuador, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, expressed concern about the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by all parties to the conflict, and in particular the violations against refugees, medical staff, civil society groups, civilians, and protectors of cultural heritage. In many cases humanitarian aid was instrumentalized as a weapon of war. Ecuador maintained its position of not supporting resolutions against certain countries which prejudged situations and helped unilateral actions. Those resolutions did not help human rights in the countries concerned, they undermined a constructive dialogue, and compromised diplomatic solutions. Ecuador regretted that the draft resolution did not hold accountable all parties involved, which aggravated violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, destabilized the region as a whole, and exacerbated the negative impact of arms transfer and illicit arms trade. For all those reasons, Ecuador would abstain from the resolution. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said Venezuela would vote against the draft resolution and continued to condemn double standards contained in the L.38 which did not provide any benefits to victims of human rights abuses. Situation in Syria called for a genuine commitment to find politically negotiated outcome, taking into account national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Council then adopted the draft resolution L.38, by a vote of 27 in favour, 4 against and 16 abstentions. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.39 ) on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , adopted by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions, the Council decides to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran for a further period of one year, and requests the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the mandate   at its fortieth session and to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session; and calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to permit access to visit the country as well as all information necessary to allow the fulfilment of the mandate. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (21): Australia, Belgium, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States. Against (7): Burundi, China, Cuba, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Venezuela. Abstentions (19): Afghanistan, Angola, Brazil,   Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kenya, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo and Tunisia. Sweden, introducing draft resolution L.39 on behalf of a group of countries, said the draft was a short procedural text to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a period of one year. Sweden welcomed the work carried out by the previous Special Rapporteur, the late Asma Jahangir. Sweden noted the increased engagement of Iran with Special Procedures and urged Tehran to allow a visit to the country by the next Special Rapporteur. Sweden hoped the draft would be adopted by consensus. Slovakia, in a general comment   said the European Union remained committed to engaging in a constructive dialogue with Iran. The European Union supported the work of the Special Rapporteur and noted the improved engagement of Iran with the Special Procedures. The European Union called on Iran to fully cooperate with the next Special Rapporteur and invited all Human Rights Council members to join consensus on the draft. Pakistan requested a vote on draft resolution L.39. External interference through country specific resolutions was counterproductive. Iran had cooperated with the United Nations human rights bodies through the Universal Periodic Review and treaty body mechanisms. Iran had also accepted the majority of recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review, showing its willingness to adhere to international human rights standards. Engagement and not estrangement was the way to promote human rights. Since the draft resolution was not in conformity with views shared by Pakistan, Pakistan would vote against it. Iran, speaking as the concerned country, said that it firmly believed in the respect of human rights, which was why it had adopted a constructive approach, both internally and externally. The Government recently adopted amendments to the anti-narcotics law, which had been recognized as progress by the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. Iran was actively engaged in the implementation of recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review. In 2017, the landslide re-election of President Rouhani, who had campaigned on a platform of stronger human rights promotion, showed the importance that the country attached to human rights. Every delegate understood that the draft resolution on Iran was not about human rights aims, but about the continued abuse of the procedures for narrow political purposes. The authors of the resolution on Iran continued in their orchestrated efforts toward reproducing an unjustified and politically motivated resolution. The appointment of the Special Rapporteur for Iran was unnecessary and inappropriate. Iran reiterated its genuine intention to conduct constructive cooperation with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the Council thematic mandate holders. Australia, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, remained deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran and said it would like to see progress there. It appreciated the periodic reporting produced by the Special Rapporteur, which afforded impartial insight into the situation in Iran. It was saddened to learn of the death of the Special Rapporteur Asma Jahangir and looked forward to the appointment of a new Special Rapporteur in due course. Brazil, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it would abstain in the vote on the draft resolution on Iran. Despite legitimate concern on the human rights situation, Brazil welcomed the efforts by the Government to improve the situation. It noted the initiatives on reforming capital punishment as a first move in the right direction. Brazil hoped that this would bring about positive change. Brazil\u2019s decision to abstain had taken into consideration the Iranian political will to engage with the international human rights system, through the Universal Periodic Review and other mechanisms. Brazil\u2019s decision must be seen as an incentive for Iran to continue on a constructive track. Brazil remained concerned about human rights violations, especially of women, children, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious groups, among others, and took the opportunity to reaffirm the aspirations of the Bahai\u2019s to peacefully exercise their human rights in the country. It was saddened to learn of the death of the Special Rapporteur. Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it would vote in favour of the draft. The report presented by the late Special Rapporteur reflected persistent challenges in Iran and the growing desire in the country to work with the international community. Mexico welcomed Tehran\u2019s increased cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. Dialogue and cooperation were essential to strengthening the institutional capacity of States. Mexico remained concerned over the application of the death sentence and the human rights of women. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the draft did not promote dialogue and cooperation. The draft was an instrument for political confrontation and reflected the manipulation of a few super powers. Venezuela continued to reject selective practices targeted at certain States and would vote against the draft. Cuba, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the mandate on Iran was a clear display of discriminatory practices against certain States. Cuba reaffirmed its opposition to country-specific mandates. Only a cooperation- and dialogue-based approach within the Human Rights Council could help promote and protect human rights. Mandates imposed without the consent of States were bound to fail. Cuba would vote against the draft. The Council adopted draft resolution L.39 by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in South Sudan In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.40 ) on the situation of human rights in South Sudan , adopted without a vote, the Council, deeply alarmed by the report of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, noting that some of the human rights violations may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, decides to extend the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, composed of three members, for a period of one year, renewable as authorized by the Human Rights Council, with the following mandate [inter alia]: to monitor and report on the situation of human rights in South Sudan, and to make recommendations to prevent further deterioration of the situation with a view to its improvement; to determine and report the facts and circumstances of, collect and preserve evidence of, and clarify responsibility for alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes, including sexual and gender-based violence and ethnic violence, with a view to ending impunity and providing accountability, and to make such information available also to all transitional justice mechanisms, including those to be established pursuant to chapter V of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, including the hybrid court for South Sudan, once established in cooperation with the African Union; and to report on the factual basis for transitional justice and reconciliation. The Council requests the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan to present an oral update   at its thirty-ninth session in an interactive dialogue, and to present a comprehensive written report, in an interactive dialogue,   at its fortieth session. United States, introducing draft resolution L.40 on behalf of the core group, particularly welcomed the productive dialogue with the Mission of South Sudan in developing the resolution before the Council. The situation of human rights in South Sudan as reported was deeply alarming. The report of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, presented to the Council last week, had detailed serious human rights violations and abuses and concluded they may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. It contained chilling accounts of looting and destruction of homes and villages; rape and other forms of sexual gender-based violence; violence against children; and extra-judicial killings on the basis of ethnicity. The report also underscored that the situation continued to be characterized by impunity. The resolution condemned in the strongest possible terms ongoing human rights violations and abuses in South Sudan. The world must come together to address these atrocities and put an end to the crisis in South Sudan. Through this resolution, the Council condemned violence by all sides, and encouraged domestic and regional efforts to foster a national reconciliation process and work to ensure accountability. In light of the Commission\u2019s report, it was clear that much work remained in carrying out the Commission\u2019s mandate, which this resolution would extend by a year. Through this resolution, the Council welcomed the Government of South Sudan\u2019s stated commitment to cooperate with the   for Human Rights, United Nations Special Procedures, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and regional, sub-regional and international mechanisms on the ground. The core group called upon the Government to honour that commitment and to give the mechanisms unhindered access and engage fully and constructively with them. It also reiterated its call for all parties to the conflict, to allow and facilitate the full, safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel, equipment and supplies free of unnecessary duties and taxes, and the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need, in particular to internally displaced persons and refugees. The Government of South Sudan was urged to sign the Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union to establish the Hybrid Court immediately. South Sudan, speaking as the concerned country, noted that the Government did appreciate the mutual spirit demonstrated by the United States and the core group in negotiating the extension of the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan. It was time to sign the Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union. The international community was urged to support the existing peace processes, including the national dialogue, which had been a vital peace process initiated by the President. Moreover, people to people peace initiatives promoted social cohesion. Finally, the High-Level Revitalization Forum on the Peace Agreement was a process led under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to prepare the ground for national elections. Those three tracks were complementary processes and had to be firmly supported to achieve lasting peace. South Sudan was born out of a long struggle for peace. South Sudan called upon the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Troika and the international community not to pursue sanctions but to complement the Government\u2019s efforts toward achieving a sustainable peace. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.43 ) on the situation of human rights in Myanmar , adopted by a vote of 32 in favour, 5 against and 10 abstentions, the Council strongly condemns the reported widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations and abuses committed in Rakhine State since 25 August 2017\u2026, expresses its deepest concern about the disproportionate response of the military and the security forces and deplores the serious deterioration of the security, human rights and humanitarian situation, [and] the exodus of almost 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh; and calls for a full and independent investigation of the reports of systematic human rights violations and abuses committed, as reported by various United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Council independent international fact-finding mission. The Council decides that the fact-finding mission must ensure that the large and continually increasing amount of evidence of human rights violations and abuses it has collected is fully documented, verified, consolidated and preserved in order for the material to be effectively shared, accessed and used by credible justice mechanisms, and requests the Secretary-General to allocate the resources necessary for this to be done; and also decides to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Myanmar for a further period of one year, requests the Special Rapporteur to present an oral progress report   at its thirty-eighth session and to submit a report to the Third Committee at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly and to the Council at its fortieth session. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (32): Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States. Against (5): Burundi, China, Cuba, Philippines and Venezuela. Abstentions (10): Angola,   Ecuador, Japan, Kenya, Mongolia, Nepal, Senegal, South Africa. Bulgaria, introducing the draft   said the Special Session called by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on the situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities last December had been a sign of the indignation of the international community toward the actions of the Myanmar military against the Rohingya in Rakhine state. The draft resolution voiced its condemnation of the abuses taking place in Myanmar. Human rights mechanisms established by the Council played a real difference on the ground and States should cooperate with mandates. The draft called on Myanmar to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur. Adoption of the draft resolution by consensus would send a strong signal of support to the Rohingya community. Australia, in a general comment, reiterated its deep concern about events in Rakhine state, including reports of systematic and widespread violations by the army and vigilantes and the clashes in northern Myanmar. It reiterated its call for an independent fact-finding mission, and called upon Myanmar to grant it unhindered access to all affected areas. All perpetrators of violence and crimes must be held accountable. Displaced persons must be allowed to return in a safe, dignified and voluntary manner in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights. It encouraged Myanmar to implement fully the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Myanmar. Implementation would be a long-term process. It welcomed the Government of Myanmar\u2019s engagement within the Bali Process on people smuggling, trafficking in persons, and transnational crimes, and stood ready to continue to support the country\u2019s democratic transition and its peace and national reconciliation at this difficult time. Myanmar, speaking as the concerned country, said that in its long march to a democratic society, it had faced daunting challenges in peace, national reconciliation and development. Maintenance of the rule of law and providing security for all in Rakhine state and the humanitarian situation there, were particular concerns for present-day Myanmar. As repatriation was an immediate step, the Government had carried out necessary preparations for reception. Regarding repatriation, the Government was ready to receive the list of people at any time. A Memorandum of Understanding between Myanmar and the United Nations Development Programme and   Refugees for their role in development and repatriation was in the making. While Myanmar did not abdicate its responsibility, the focus should be on the way forward for finding a sustainable solution for the future. At this juncture, the world should be concentrating its efforts to help Myanmar with humanitarian assistance and capacity building to alleviate and end the suffering of internally and externally displaced populations. The draft resolution, in PP7 mentioned \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Diplomatic corps and United Nations agencies had already witnessed that most of the Muslim population and their villages remained intact and they were assuming their daily livelihoods as before. If ethnic cleansing was happening, why had many chosen to continue to reside there? Furthermore, PP12 expressed ongoing intimidation and violence. There was no basis for this allegation. Representatives of diplomatic corps, all United Nations agencies and journalists had been to the Maungtaw area numerous times in January and February 2018 and had witnessed the active resumption of normal livelihoods. Operational paragraph 7 was holding the military and security forces accountable for the security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Maungtaw areas in Rakhine State. Myanmar noted that threats, reprisals, instigations, false hopes, forced recruitments and slaughtering the dozens of Hindus by ARSA had played a critical role in the abrupt change of the daily livelihoods of all people. Immediate and primary causes and effects should be analyzed more closely in a balanced and forward-looking manner. Operational paragraph 9 was factually flawed as there was no curfew order in the whole of Rakhine state. The usage of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in OP11 was incorrect, while with regard to OP13, Myanmar had never rejected the allegations. Operational paragraph 17 related to the collection of evidence of human rights violations and abuses, the credibility of which was crucial. Operational paragraph 23 on land confiscations was unreasonable, and OP8 was most intrusive. The situation in Myanmar was linked to the authority of the Security Council and thereon, to the International Criminal Court. There must be concrete evidence and legal determination to what constituted a crime related to violations and abuses of international human rights law. The notion of this paragraph was a threat and a direct challenge to the State\u2019s sovereignty. Although Myanmar saw some paragraphs acknowledging and welcoming the efforts made by the Government of Myanmar, the aforementioned factually-flawed, intrusive, sovereignty-infringing paragraphs had surpassed these. Against this background, Myanmar categorically rejected the draft resolution. China, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, was concerned about the situation in Myanmar and condemned the escalation of violence. The situation was now calmer and Myanmar and Bangladesh had been continuing their talks, so the international community should lend its support to the dialogue. China always believed in dialogue and respect of sovereignty and did not believe that pressure could result in some progress. Action taken by the Council had to focus toward the continuation of the dialogue between Myanmar and Bangladesh. The draft resolution which was put forward did not reflect the progress made by Myanmar in bilateral efforts and was only putting pressure and conflicting elements on the concerned country. China had participated in the resolution of the conflict and had contributed toward a peaceful solution, but the authors of the draft resolution had not taken that into account. The draft resolution did not create conducive conditions to dialogue, it did not reflect the interests of parties concerned and it would not alleviate the suffering across the region. China called for a vote on the draft resolution, and said it would vote against it. Japan, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it had been actively engaged in informal consultations to achieve a balanced text, however, Japan would abstain from voting. The safe return of the displaced was crucial and the involvement of   Refugees was essential so the decision of Myanmar to cooperate with   Refugees was important. Bangladesh was praised for its generosity in hosting the displaced population and the international community needed to provide appropriate assistance. The Government of Myanmar was urged to implement the recommendations of Kofi Annan\u2019s Advisory Commission. Japan was providing humanitarian and development assistance to Myanmar, including to Rakhine state, and the international community was urged to do the same. Philippines, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it had been following developments of a complex inter-communal issue in northern Rakhine state, including the positive developments in Myanmar. Concern was raised about the humanitarian situation. All acts of violence were condemned. The provision of humanitarian assistance was supported and the international community was urged to further assist Myanmar and its neighbour Bangladesh. Philippines did not support the international fact-finding mission as it rested on the wrong assumption that domestic investigative processes were not independent and credible. For that reason, the Philippines would vote no. The Council then adopted the draft resolution L43, by a vote of 32 in favour, 5 against and 10 abstentions. Explanation of the Vote After the Vote After the Conclusion of Taking Action on Resolutions under the Agenda Item on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council\u2019s Attention United States, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said it remained a leader in the fight against impunity for international crimes. The International Criminal Court could play a critical role by exercising its power judiciously and within the parameters of international law. The United States reiterated its serious and fundamental concern with the Court\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek an investigation into allegations against United States personnel in the context of the conflict in Afghanistan. Egypt, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, referring to the resolution on South Sudan, said it took great care to participate during the consultation process and to ensure human rights objectives were not politicized. Concerns remained over certain paragraphs in the draft, namely operative paragraph 15. Egypt broke consensus on operative paragraphs 15 and 16(b) of the draft. Turning to the text on Myanmar, Egypt said it was closely following the situation in Rakhine state. Egypt did not support dealing with human rights issues through resolutions not approved by the country concerned. Egypt voted for the draft but voiced reservations over operative paragraph 8. Kyrgyzstan, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said it had not ratified the Rome Statute and therefore disassociated itself from the paragraph relating to this, in the resolution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "human rights council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "myanmar human rights council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "independent international commission of inquiry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission on human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic people\u2019s republic of korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:25:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "090f6b7205a359486c0ddc4b4ab35776ee69b549", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpUXjhVQR9dfclDaXKA3E3jBa40r3pIGsdR.BpQB9wNj6qs_9ASrxFk5iw8CKI_QDFFe6wrReDhQQvf79042rLy7ZPicYa4hB.5VbwsaxKHNMf0RRLYczh4SW7ZFjbDDvCIkeSMHTdw.HuBx55Bp5EHIDU5.ikWNiaPaZmrD3wrSbx8vFHlZouI99FZfMqVRSyybn86QJzF5CzQ2WzMMe40waBL1XEFMIfjfv0OSWg7cOmdiu7QJVWu9zHLzCQ4vZTDhz6e3N8djrn7ozjAqGBJjhEJFCarQCWAiqLmBS65A--", "site_full": "www.romandie.com", "site": "romandie.com", "site_section": "http://www.romandie.com/rss/flux.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Romandie", "title": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "title_full": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "published": "2018-03-23T09:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 52332, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "090f6b7205a359486c0ddc4b4ab35776ee69b549", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpUXjhVQR9dfclDaXKA3E3jBa40r3pIGsdR.BpQB9wNj6qs_9ASrxFk5iw8CKI_QDFFe6wrReDhQQvf79042rLy7ZPicYa4hB.5VbwsaxKHNMf0RRLYczh4SW7ZFjbDDvCIkeSMHTdw.HuBx55Bp5EHIDU5.ikWNiaPaZmrD3wrSbx8vFHlZouI99FZfMqVRSyybn86QJzF5CzQ2WzMMe40waBL1XEFMIfjfv0OSWg7cOmdiu7QJVWu9zHLzCQ4vZTDhz6e3N8djrn7ozjAqGBJjhEJFCarQCWAiqLmBS65A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T09:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "text": "M\u00e9dia suisse fond\u00e9 en 1997 - Toute l'information en temps r\u00e9el Min Max : 9\u00b0 C WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet WISeKey International Holding SA / BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet .
