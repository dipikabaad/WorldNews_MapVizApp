And I\u2019m a forward-looking guy who doesn\u2019t spend much time dwelling on whether I should be home again,\u201d says Amsler, born in the north-eastern Swiss canton of Schaffhausen in 1936. On a recent visit to Switzerland, he dropped by swissinfo.ch to talk about his study of a Ticino village with remarkable architecture. \nWithout knowing that he\u2019s an octogenarian, you wouldn\u2019t think to offer the elevator, and Amsler takes the stairs in stride, asking, \u201cIs this a new building?\u201d and looking around with curiosity. Atlantic crossing \nHaving been offered a travel fellowship to see American architecture first-hand, Amsler and his wife and two young children embarked on the five-day cruise from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to New York City. From there they headed up the coast to Duxbury, Massachusetts, where Amsler had a contact. \n\u201cThe idea was to have an experience and then to go back to Switzerland,\u201d laughs Amsler. But it didn\u2019t work out that way \u2013 \u201cprimarily because I immediately got immersed in very interesting and relatively independent work \u2013 even as an employee\u201d. \nOne of his most prominent projects was the control tower at Logan International Airport in Boston. Amsler\u2019s employer, architecture firm Desmond and Lord, assigned him the role of project manager. \n\u201cAt the time it was the highest control tower in the world. It\u2019s unusual because it has two legs and is connected at the top, and that was because Massachusetts required two exits, so there are stairs in each leg,\u201d explains Amsler. Also at Logan Airport, he designed a hangar and worked on the central power plant and international terminal, which was expanding at the time. \nAmsler also designed the Southeastern Massachusetts University campus, which is now the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Later, he and two friends started their own firm, and Amsler acted as an independent contractor as well. At home in Marblehead \nWhile working in Boston, Amsler found a dream house north of the city: a small \u201csummer\u201d home across the street from the ocean in Marblehead. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not unlike a small town in Switzerland. We were lucky to end up in a town that is much more European-feeling than American-feeling. All the houses are wooden and the streets are crooked. So we felt very much at home there,\u201d Amsler says. \nBut it was about five years before he and his family could afford a visit to Switzerland. \nAmsler says he was never homesick, but of course he missed friends \u2013 and certain foods. \n\u201cAt the beginning, you only got spongy bread in America, but we don\u2019t have that problem anymore. Same thing with cheeses. You had maybe two or three in the supermarket then, but that\u2019s changed so we can get everything now. We can even buy Swiss chocolate.\u201d \nWhat Amsler still misses is the traditional Swiss-style sausage, called \u201cBratwurst\u201d in German. He sometimes places an order with a special sausage company in Colorado. \n\u201cWhen we have a big party, I\u2019ll order 50 bratwursts to grill, and people love \u2019em,\u201d Amsler says with relish. \nMeanwhile, he\u2019s come to appreciate the local cuisine; particularly sweet corn sold at local farm stands and seafood from the local waters. \n\u201cWe have great fish restaurants in Marblehead. Great lobster, fish, seafood in general,\u201d Amsler notes. Something special about New England \nExcept for visits, Amsler can\u2019t imagine returning to Switzerland at this point. \n\u201cFor one thing, I can\u2019t afford it \u2013 to live in a place as nice as I live now. That\u2019s the main reason. And the other reason is that all my direct family is now American,\u201d says Amsler, now a dual citizen, divorced, and with a new partner. \nAnd besides, he\u2019s in love with New England, too. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in another country for that long, it\u2019s not only new friends that you make, but it\u2019s just the place itself. I love New England; there\u2019s something very special about it,\u201d Amsler says. He especially likes the rugged countryside and the ocean, and he also loves Cape Cod for its history, beauty, and the beaches where he goes windsurfing. \nIn winter, he\u2019s drawn to the mountains of New England. \n\u201cI still go snowboarding once a week if you can believe it \u2013 at my age! My kids say to me, \u2018You\u2019re crazy \u2013 you should stop\u2019,\u201d chuckles Amsler. You can tell he has no intention of doing so. \n\u00a9 swissinfo.ch The above content produced by swissinfo.ch is not intended for commercial use and may not be republished by third parties either wholly or in part.

The public defence takes place in the Senaatszaal at Erasmus University Rotterdam, at 11.30 a.m. \nThis study focuses on the civil justice system competition in the EU, a form of regulatory competition in which states try to attract parties to litigate in their jurisdictions. In this study, the term civil justice system refers to the whole apparatus involved in the resolution and enforcement of civil disputes. Many institutions and parties are engaged in this process, with courts, lawyers, and governments being the obvious examples. In this context, the present study\u2019s main research question is \u2018How do civil justice systems compete in the EU?\u2019 \nTo arrive at an answer, both a theoretical and an empirical approach are taken. The theoretical part considers various aspects of competition, but most importantly it offers an overview of regulatory competition, an analysis of the legal framework within which Member States operate, and an analysis of the civil justice system market and its elements. Based on the theoretical analysis, the empirical part is divided into two components; the first contains an analysis of data provided by the 2016 EU Justice Scoreboard, while the second analyses a survey on lawyers\u2019 court preferences in the EU that has been conducted for this research. The symbiosis between the theoretical and the empirical part adds more depth to the research, and contributes new data and analyses to the ongoing academic debate.

Photo: @geertwilderspvv / Twitter \nGeert Wilders and his PVV won city council seats seats in each one of the 30 municipalities the party participated in during the municipal elections on Wednesday. In total the PVV currently stands on 74 seats, the Volkskrant reports. \nDuring the previous municipal elections four years ago, the PVV only participated in two municipalities - Almere and The Hague. The party got fewer seats in those two municipalities this time around. In Almere the party dropped from nine to seven seats, and in The Hague from seven to two seats. \nIn Nissewaard, which covers Spijkenisse and its surroundings, the party won five seats. Relatively, the PVV got the most votes in Rucphen - 20.3 percent - giving it four seats. The PVV also won four seats in Terneuzen and in Venlo, and two in Rotterdam. The party is now also in the city councils of cities like Zaanstad, Enschede, Zoetermeer, Arnhem, Maastricht and Den Bosch. \nNot all the votes are counted yet, so the PVV may get a few more seats. In Utrecht the party stands on one so far, and in Stichtse Vecht on two. \n\"Fantastic!\" Wilders wrote on Twitter. \"Great results in Nissewaard, Venlo, Terneuzen, Rucphen, Maastricht, Zaanstad, Emmen, Almelo, Lelystad, Dordrecht and many other municipalities where the PVV sound will be heard from now on!
