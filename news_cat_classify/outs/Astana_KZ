The musician, whose performances are well known not only in Kazakhstan, but abroad, has presented to the public an unusual program: in one evening he led the audience through various eras of classical music.

But as the pianist says, the ability to adjust to the styles of different composers is not the most difficult part of the musician\u2019s work.
