Photo: AFP AFP 22 March 2018 20:41 CET+01:00 Austrian MPs on Thursday scrapped a smoking ban in bars and restaurants that was due to come into force in May, despite a petition in its favour collecting 545,000 signatures. \nThe overturning of the ban, introduced by the previous government, was approved by lawmakers from the ruling coalition of the conservatives and the far-right. \nIn an attempt to assuage critics, they also voted to extend the minimum age for smoking to 18 as well as to ban smoking in vehicles if a minor is on board, effective from 2019. \nScrapping the ban was a key campaign pledge last year by the cigarette-loving leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), Heinz-Christian Strache, 48. \nHe argued that a ban would infringe on \"freedom of choice\" and that he wanted to protect restaurant and bar owners whose businesses he said would be hit by a ban. \nThe Alpine country is one of Europe's last havens for tobacco lovers and is nicknamed by anti-smoking campaigners the \"Ashtray of Europe\". \nSmokers have to be seated in a separate area in bars and restaurants, but campaigners say that this fails to stop the smoke wafting elsewhere, and the rules are often flouted in any case. \nNo separate area is necessary in establishments smaller than 50 square metres (540 square feet) if the owner is happy to allow smoking on the premises. \nSome 13,000 people die of tobacco-related causes in Austria each year. The country has the third-highest proportion of smokers in the EU (30 percent of those over 15), according to Eurostat. \nThe ongoing petition in favour of an outright ban threatens to put the FP\u00d6 in a tricky position since another of its campaign pledges was to have more referendums and \"direct democracy\". \nChancellor Sebastian Kurz, 31, of the People's Party (\u00d6VP), a non-smoker, says he is bound by his coalition agreement with the FP\u00d6. \nHis party was part of the previous coalition with the Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) that approved the smoking ban in the first place. \n\"You are acting against science and without a conscience. You are making a deliberate decision today in favour of death,\" said Matthias Strolz, head of the small opposition party the NEOS.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heinz-christian strache", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "freedom party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T06:43:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d03744630f14748fbf7a9f97d224bcbaee6afd07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQr8gPav8dPNysBYgm.5wcKinVnP8BXi2NwaM8ost0g6yAlsu8geT_CbJqwHDGZfIHI9C5Krw1KZg--", "site_full": "www.wien.info", "site": "wien.info", "site_section": "https://www.wien.info/en/event-highlights.rss", "site_categories": ["travel", "eastern_europe"], "section_title": "Event highlights", "title": "Vienna Blues Spring Festival 2018", "title_full": "Vienna Blues Spring Festival 2018", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 57813, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d03744630f14748fbf7a9f97d224bcbaee6afd07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQr8gPav8dPNysBYgm.5wcKinVnP8BXi2NwaM8ost0g6yAlsu8geT_CbJqwHDGZfIHI9C5Krw1KZg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vienna Blues Spring Festival 2018", "text": "Vienna Blues Spring Festival 2018 20 March - 30 April 2018 \nVienna has the blues - with the world\u2019s longest-running blues festival.

The ICPDR is responsible for ensuring the sustainable and equitable use of waters in the Danube River Basin, and as such is committed to this year's World Water Day theme \"Nature for Water\" for the good of the 90 million people living in the Basin. \"At the centre of our activities in the Danube basin are human wellbeing and safety as well as good conditions for the environment,\" said ICPDR President Helge Wendenburg. Water availability and supply Following the 2015 droughts, the ICPDR has elaborated a report on the impact of droughts in the Danube Basin, the measures taken and lessons learned. The \"2015 Droughts in the Danube River Basin Report\" includes an overview on the main characteristics of the meteorological and hydrological situation during 2015. It also summarizes the main impact on water-related sectors and includes an overview of measures taken by the individual Danube countries. The ICPDR is updating its Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, which aims to provide the foundations for a common, Danube-wide understanding of the future impact of climate change on water resources. The strategy will look at possible adaptation measures for water management, ecosystem-based measures and managerial measures such as the promotion of water-saving behaviour, technological measures such as the development of more efficient irrigation systems in agriculture, and different policy approaches in the Danube River Basin and its sub-basins. River Basin & Flood Risk management In response to the danger of flooding, the ICPDR is engaged in a range of activities to manage flood risks. The ICPDR is a coordination platform for the implementation of the EU Floods Directive and for the preparation and update of the Danube Flood Risk Management Plan. Linking of flood risk management with the river basin management is one of the key goals of the ICPDR. Wetlands are a lot more than just a source of natural beauty and a recreational destination for locals. They offer a wide range of ecosystem services. They act as retention areas during flood events, which demonstrates how they are an essential nature-based solution for safety and risk management in the Danube River Basin. In addition, wetlands contribute to the control of water quality and are important hotspots of biodiversity. Wetlands also support considerate forms of tourism, fisheries and other economic and social interests of local communities. The ICPDR has dedicated considerable efforts to the protection, restoration and creation of wetlands and reconnection of floodplains to the river system in the Danube River Basin. \"We encourage all to raise awareness for using nature-based solutions in water management this World Water Day and beyond,\" said President Wendenburg.
