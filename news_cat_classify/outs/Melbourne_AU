The ultimate would have been to get 1,100kg, but it didn't happen.\" \nHe also broke the squat record of 435kg with his 440kg squat and broke his own deadlift record of 400kg with a 405kg lift, and bench-pressed 245kg. \nMr Manuel was Australia's powerlifting champion for five years in a row until he attended a meet-and-greet in Western Australia. \n\"I just had to tell them my story and they wanted to watch me train, and I was supposed to do just a few squats.\" External Link: Powerlifting FB \nHe made it to 340kg when disaster struck and he ruptured the tendon in his quadricep. \n\"It was more embarrassing because I was trying to teach people how to squat and I fell on my face.\" \nMr Manuel underwent surgery as soon as he returned to his hometown of Rockhampton, and the long road to recovery began. \n\"The doctor told me it was going to take 18 months and I laughed at him, because normally I recover from injuries quite well, even the major ones. \n\"But this time I think he was right.\" Mental scars \nIt took Mr Manuel a year to get back on track physically, but the mental scars have taken a lot longer to heal. \n\"Even when I did that 440kg swat on the weekend and I was in the hole, I was thinking about it, which you shouldn't when you're doing that. \n\"I was thinking, 'Geez, please don't blow,' and I pushed it up and it was good.\" \nHe was worried even when walking up and down stairs that he could have another rupture. \nThis didn't stop Mr Manuel from training, and even three months after his operation he was back into doing what he describes as \"reasonable\" weights. \n\"Not heavy, but enough to scare the doctors, but I didn't tell them what I was doing.\" \nHe took it day by day, week by week, and within a year he started to get better and made the decision to begin extremely heavy weights \u2014 400kg plus. \nWhile recovering, Mr Manuel had his title and record snatched away by Alex Simon, who lifted 1,077.5kg. \nSo when the ProRaw competition approached this year, it was time to dip his toe back into competition waters. \n\"Originally the goal was just to get back on the platform,\" he said. \n\"But as we started prepping, I realised it's starting to come back again, so I had the goal on the record to take a number one spot.\" \nThe aim was to get 1,080kg and reclaim the number one spot, and he did. The physical toll \nPowerlifting does take its toll, and this is not the first time Mr Manuel has been injured. \nThree years ago, he tore the tendon from his bicep during a deadlift and it cost him that particular competition. \n\"I tried to keep going but I could feel my bicep up around my shoulder and I thought, 'Nah, I'd better drop it'.\" \n\"That's the only time I've lost.\" Photo: Odell Manuel was quietly confident a week before the competition, but he didn't want to talk too much in case he jinxed it. (ABC Capricornia: Inga St\u00fcnzner) \nIt also puts pressure on the joints, and this is even more of an issue considering Mr Manuel has osteoarthritis. \nThis condition is why he ended an NRL career that saw him play for the Warriors, NZ Maori and the Canberra Raiders. \n\"It does get painful at times, but as long as you're taking your fish oils and joint formulas and all that, and that's why we use wraps. \n\"Even though it doesn't stop the joint from clinging together, I think with the wraps it helps me too. \n\"Sometimes it gets sore. I get weeks where I can't walk.\" Driving force \nConsidering powerlifting has caused more injuries than league, what drives Mr Manuel? \n\"I think this is a calling for me. \n\"I believe I was born to lift.\" \nAlthough he played in the NRL, Mr Manuel said he was not a natural player and had to work hard. \n\"When it came to lifting, that was different and later on I knew if I pursued it, I would not be too bad at it.\" \nThe focus now is on the biggest powerlifting competition in the country, the international Big Dog, in October. \n\"If we can get 1,100kg there, that will be really good. \n\"Who knows, we might get more \u2014 but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "odell manuel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manuel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian broadcasting corporation", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T23:11:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8032dfa575e0b072d0687987f7ee5c66621260c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nlWi4Rzc5PX8gpmmzuUspasen91xWHKKTvubt_wrhibkpR2YsZFctenlEsZRu5z.1le10WPwickeoHIPoOFBalTYss8GTn89E", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/au/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport", "title_full": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport | The Guardian", "published": "2018-03-23T07:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cc26d0fc8b0f9e8d935a3663c1b1f09d59c578/0_87_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw&amp;s=730e8e474ae77278de3a98fc2e3e40ba", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2973, "comments": 0, "shares": 2973}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8032dfa575e0b072d0687987f7ee5c66621260c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nlWi4Rzc5PX8gpmmzuUspasen91xWHKKTvubt_wrhibkpR2YsZFctenlEsZRu5z.1le10WPwickeoHIPoOFBalTYss8GTn89E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "theguardian.com", "published": "2018-03-23T07:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport", "text": "T he dramatic build up to this weekend\u2019s AFLW grand final escalated further on the eve of the game with Western Bulldogs captain Katie Brennan announcing she will lodge a formal sex discrimination complaint against the AFL with the Australian Human Rights Commission. It\u2019s a savvy legal move that will compel the AFL to completely rethink its approach to sanctioning women.\n\nAFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence Read more \nBrennan\u2019s two-game ban raised immediate allegations of sex-based discrimination . The reason was simple: were Brennan were a man, she would have been asked to pay a fine, instead of being suspended. The sole reason women do not get the option of paying a fine is wage disparity (the average wage for a men\u2019s AFL player is $371,000, whereas AFLW rookies receive just $10,500). Rather than opting to have the women pay smaller fines on a pro rata basis, the AFL went with a different system that results in them being sanctioned more severely.\nThere has been an explosion of public interest in the case this week. There have also been many misconceptions about the relationship between elite sporting competitions and the law. Although sporting competitions are entitled to develop their own rules, those rules must comply with overarching legal obligations. In Australia this includes the Federal Sex Discrimination Act, which prevents discrimination against people on the basis of their sex, except in very specific circumstances.\nBrennan twice appealed the suspension. Surprisingly, her legal team didn\u2019t pursue this line of argument at the first hearing. At the second hearing , she did, represented by a team of lawyers including Jack Rush QC and Bulldogs president, Peter Gordon. The AFL argued that Brennan\u2019s legal team should have raised those arguments the first time around, were barred from raising entirely new arguments the second time around, and were simply trying to have a second bite at the cherry. Disappointingly, the appeals board deliberated for just 15 minutes, gave no reasons for its decision, and dismissed the appeal. The failure to provide an explanation for its decision raised even more legal questions, including the possibility that this was itself a denial of a fundamental legal principle \u2013 that of procedural fairness. \nKatie Brennan falls victim to gender pay gap with AFLW grand final ban | Kate O'Halloran Read more \nAll eyes were on the Bulldogs\u2019 next move. Gordon is a renowned litigator who rarely shies away from a fight and as social media exploded with speculation, a #FreeKatieBrennan movement was launched, including a petition . There was growing recognition that Brennan was a victim of circumstance, and an imperfect system which yielded a result only made possible because there are different \u2013 and more severe \u2013 rules for women.\nOn Friday morning, the Dogs announced that they would not seek an injunction in the supreme or federal court. But then came the kicker. In an unexpected move, the club announced that Brennan is lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the suspension was unlawful on human rights grounds.\nThe Commission will not deal with the case before the grand final this weekend. Brennan will not play. But the lodging of a human rights complaint is a strategic masterstroke that forces the AFL into an impossible position. Here\u2019s why: the Commission is an independent third party, whose job is to investigate human rights complaints and to help parties resolve their disputes. The Commission will ask the AFL to consider the specifics of Brennan\u2019s complaint, before overseeing a conciliation. There, Brennan will sit down with the AFL to air her concerns and the Commission will try to help them both come to a resolution.\nBrennan will almost certainly demand three things from the AFL: that they admit the tribunal system unfairly discriminates against women; that they overhaul the system so that the rules are fair and no other woman will be put in Brennan\u2019s position again; and finally, that her suspension be wiped from the historic record, as a matter of principle.\nIf the AFL does not accede, Brennan can go to the federal court and seek a hearing. The AFL will be taking a huge risk if it allows things to go that far. It cannot afford a formal court hearing where such arguments are thrashed out by teams of lawyers, with QCs getting paid hourly rates comparable to an entire season\u2019s wage for many of the women. \nBrennan grand final suspension shows AFLW needs stand-alone tribunal Read more \nIt would be a public relations disaster for the AFL, and generate significant bad blood with players and fans, including the new audience it has found through the AFLW. Most of all, the AFL cannot afford to risk the chance of a formal federal court finding that its fledgling AFLW competition \u2013 a pillar of its putative commitment to gender equality and equal opportunity for women \u2013 is inherently discriminatory. It would be a disastrous result for CEO Gil McLachlan, and one that he will be desperate to avoid.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s almost certain that the AFL will capitulate at the first hurdle, and accede to some \u2013 and perhaps all \u2013 of Brennan\u2019s demands at conciliation. The AFL will be asked to admit that its system \u2013 while well-intentioned \u2013 wasn\u2019t perfect and produced a perverse result that has left Brennan on the wrong side of history. Her move is a hugely significant one, not just for current AFLW footballers, but for future generations of girls and women who will play the game. A star on the field, Brennan has now laid down a huge challenge to the code off it. The ball is now in the AFL\u2019s court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics AFLW Australian rules football Australia sport comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie brennan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriet cordner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sport western bulldogs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "human rights commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aflw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:23:56.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fe9a46395f85fc0e409b83b36e720d575aba399", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1BNiDBFlZOxxG2LdivEzStphX5eU.ZISApUJWei3ZkraroEiXla5X9dC4jYMKDNs46zry8A70Whm.mqgxFL4M5DdYcSYEcNX2MkJI_EoGlGYXNrbyzB6VzQ--", "site_full": "au.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "title_full": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "published": "2018-03-22T22:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.148, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/FIRvLsJ7EwxbjbRt6yc6qw--~D/cm90YXRlPWF1dG87Zmk9ZmlsbDtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVv/https://s.yimg.com/ea/img/-/180323/5ab42019913d1_stand_off_art_2_5ab42008d5a55.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2070, "comments": 0, "shares": 2070}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fe9a46395f85fc0e409b83b36e720d575aba399", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1BNiDBFlZOxxG2LdivEzStphX5eU.ZISApUJWei3ZkraroEiXla5X9dC4jYMKDNs46zry8A70Whm.mqgxFL4M5DdYcSYEcNX2MkJI_EoGlGYXNrbyzB6VzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "News", "published": "2018-03-22T22:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "text": "Father charged over teen's one-punch death \nDashcam video shows the motorists meeting on a narrow road in Toorak but sparks fly when neither agree to move out of the way. \nThe male driver filming the encounter can be heard expressing his frustration moments before the woman exits her car. \n\u201cYou\u2019re holding up the whole road,\u201d he tells the woman as she makes her way to his window.

No horned helmets \nMs Hejll said it was believed German composer Richard Wagner was partly responsible for the myth of the horned helmet. \nIn one of Wagner's Operas, his dressmaker wanted to emphasise the evil characters and used the symbol of horns to help the audience understand who was good, and who was bad. \nOther European artists also added horns to helmets to make their paintings more dramatic. A Viking isn't a type of person \nMs Hejll said a Viking was actually something you do. \n\"They were not an ethnic group or anything. You were not a Viking. You went on Viking. That was something you did,\" she said. \n\"A person could be a Viking in part of their life but most people and most of your life, you were farmers.\" \nMs Hejll said the long journeys they embarked on could often last four years. \nThe word has now been adopted to refer to the Scandinavian people living at that time. They were smart \nMs Hejll said that when going on a Viking, the men and women did not have any navigation instruments. \nThey often travelled to the same places several times. \n\"Imagine that you set off from the Norwegian coast for example to Iceland and Greenland,\" she said. \n\"How did they know they would land there the second time? \n\"They were skilled sailors, they were skilled navigators. They could read the nature, the currents, the birds, the stars, the winds.\" \nIntricately-made jewellery, artworks and clothing are on display throughout the exhibition, showing they were more than barbaric warriors. Being clean was important \nIf you search for images of Vikings, you'll get a lot of scruffy looking characters from the television series. Photo: It turns out combs were a must-have accessory for men and women. (ABC News: Joanna Crothers) \nArtefacts like washbasins, combs, ear spoons and tweezers actually suggest a lot of pride was taken in their appearance, according Ms Hejll. \n\"Everyone had a comb and I think you have that for a reason \u2014 to make your hair look good.You dyed your yarnto have colours in your home and on your clothes,\" she said. \nAristocrats also woredelicate brooches and jewellery as a sign of their wealth. \nClothes were also important for showing people which region you came from, as Vikings were centred around family. \n\"You would be buried with your personal belongings, and your own traditional dress,\" Ms Hauptman said. \n\"They had heavy brooches and the shape of the brooch tells people which region you're from.\" Women were powerful \nWhen a woman's husband was away on a Viking, a key that hung from her belt was a symbol to everyone that she was the lady of the house. \nWhen a woman's husband went on a Viking to trade, find new land or take part in wars, the woman looked after the farm and were responsible for all the people working on it. Photo: A bronze key with an animal depicted in the middle of the handle.

The behaviour that we exhibit rubs off on the kids. \n\"Making time to eat, eating together, all of these things are kind of important.\" We're supposed to limit our sugar to six teaspoons a day, but do you know how much of it is hiding in some of our most popular groceries? Colour and variety is key \nDietician Nicole Dynan said that when at home, young children should be eating the same meal as the rest of the family. \nShe said she would like to see restaurants make kids' menus more like the ones for adults. \n\"If there was some sort of pasta dish for the adults, it would be nice to have a modified version of that [for children],\" she said. \nMs Dynan said the secret to feeding children was colour and variety, and by thinking creatively it was even possible to get children to eat salad. \n\"They love things like iceberg lettuce, cucumber, carrots.\" \nShe said there was no reason for a restaurant to serve a processed chicken nugget when they could serve real chicken instead. \nMr Pangu said he called his initiative Death To Nuggets because they \"were a good symbol of everything that's going wrong with the food that we're eating\". \n\"Most factory-made nuggets are 30 per cent chicken. What's the rest of it? You probably don't want to know.\" Photo: Thinking creatively can help get children eating.

He believed 24 hours was long enough for people to bring their bins in after they had been emptied.\nMackay Mayor Greg Williamson said in response to complaints, the waste management team within the council had defined \u201creasonable\u201d to be 24 hours when drafting up the proposed local law.\nAlthough the law would now be able to policed, Cr Williamson said the change was not in response to a problem in the region where bins had been left out.\nSince April there had only been 18 complaints about people leaving their bins out on the street and nobody has ever been fined.\nCr Williamson said the purpose of the local law was to give local officers \u201csome teeth\u201d when dealing with people who were doing the wrong thing.\n\u201cLocal officers are out there trying and making sure (Mackay) has an urban environment that looks good,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the case where someone complains that there is a land owner or occupier of a dwelling not doing the right thing by the environment, and people that live in that area, we need this local law or otherwise it is a free-for-all.\u201d\nCr Williamson was insistent that the law wasn\u2019t to raise money and would only be policed if people complained about their neighbours.\nAccording to the draft law, the rightful place for a bin to be kept at a home is \u201cat ground level close to the rear alignment of a building\u201d.\nBrisbane City Council, which allows a fine of $1260, has retained similar working to the old piece of legislation.\nAnother section of the proposed law confirms only the local government- approved tip shop is allowed to take rubbish from the dump.\nShare this on Facebook social-facebook_circle Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle Comments nav_small_down nav_small_up Post Comment Hide Comments nav_small_down nav_small_up Most viewed \u2018Haunted\u2019 by midwife\u2019s sex confession \u2018Haunted\u2019 by midwife\u2019s sex confession Police say Bribie beach deaths suspicious Police say Bribie beach deaths suspicious Sack Smith now!

| Gay Alcorn | Opinion", "text": "I \u2019m a citizen of Melbourne . That\u2019s all. Not an economist, nor a politician, a property developer, a demographer. Just a resident with an affection for the city, with all its flaws and idiosyncrasies.\nAs a citizen, nobody has been able to explain to me clearly why Melbourne, and Australia for that matter, should be absorbing so many new people every year, at a rate far higher than the OECD average, faster than other developed nations, with no feasible plan to cope with it.\nThe epicentre of what former New South Wales premier Bob Carr calls Australia\u2019s \u201cweird experiment\u201d is Melbourne, my town. Melbourne is on the brink of being a city of 5 million and is growing at record rates (Victoria grew 2.3% in the year to June 2017, way above the national average of 1.6%, itself exceptionally high by developed nation standards).\nAustralia's fierce immigration debate is about to get louder Read more\nDear old Melbourne added a quarter of its population in just 10 years to 2016. At this rate \u2013 and projecting population growth is a wobbly science \u2013 it will be home to nearly 8 million by mid-century, overtaking Sydney as the country\u2019s largest city.\nThe impact of this growth is the single most important issue in this town (and no doubt in Sydney, too, and to a lesser extent in Brisbane and Perth). As a lowly if curious citizen, the refusal of any major political party, let alone business groups, for whom the more people the better, to question the pace of growth, even to explain it, is astonishing.\nI read report after report which assume with scant elaboration that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to record population growth. The result is a rumbling backlash, and a justifiable one.\nAt least this debate is now being held, when for too long it was stuck in our debilitating culture wars, with many progressives wary that questioning immigration rates would give succour to racists.\nWe can ignore the Pauline Hansons who want to stop Muslims coming here. We can ignore, too, those elements of Tony Abbott\u2019s argument that one reason for easing immigration is because in Melbourne, \u201cethnic gangs (are) testing the resolve of police.\u201d That\u2019s a dog-whistle.\nBut we can no longer ignore the tougher questions: the majority of our population growth is due to immigration, particularly in the past decade. Around three quarters of immigrants settle in big cities, where the jobs are.\nThose cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, are not coping and this circular argument that all we need is better infrastructure and planning and all will be well is arguing backwards. Can we answer first why we want record population growth, and then discuss infrastructure?\nThe truth is that successive governments, state and federal, have not improved public transport and housing affordability and facilities for the booming outer suburbs anywhere near the rate that is needed for the current population, let alone for the hapless people who arrive each week.\nEven with the will \u2013 and if the public were willing to pay for it \u2013 few state governments could cope with this level of growth. Some of Melbourne\u2019s boom is because people are moving here from interstate \u2013 we can\u2019t control that. Governments have little control over how many babies we have. But we can control immigration, which, absent a population policy, is our de facto population policy.\nThe case for easing immigration is compelling. Even if it\u2019s just for a few years, from an annual permanent immigration intake of around 200,000 to 100,000, to catch up. Even if it\u2019s just so we can take a breath and think about how big this country should be without having it decided for us by default.\nLet me offer two examples from the world\u2019s most liveable city, a wry joke if you live here. We are stuck in traffic, long lines of fumes and angry horns, for weeks of our lives. The state government is spending huge amounts on infrastructure, including Victoria\u2019s biggest-ever public transport project, the Metro Tunnel, an $11bn underground rail project that will add five new stations and ease bottlenecks. When will it open? Around 2025.\nWill our congestion get better? No way. The prediction is that in two decades, half of all car trips in Melbourne at peak times will be congested, up from a third now. And, according to Infrastructure Victoria , that\u2019s taking into consideration the planned road and rail upgrades.\nLet\u2019s take schools. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government a few days ago announced that it would spend nearly $240m to buy land for another 14 schools in suburbs with exploding population.\nEducation minister James Merlino boasted that 10 new schools opened last year, 11 would open this year and nine next year. That\u2019s great. But the Grattan Institute a couple of years ago estimated that Victoria would need 220 news schools within a decade. The school where Merlino chose to make his announcement, the John Henry Primary School in exploding Pakenham, is at capacity and is taking no new enrolments . It opened just last year.\nBusinesses and property developers want more and more people because they want bigger markets and more consumers. Most economists seem to like it because they argue it\u2019s great for the economy although, as a more sceptical Ross Gittins pointed out, the productivity commission has found its net impacts to be \u201cnegligible\u201d .\nAnd it is true that our migrant intake is skewed towards skilled migrants, with a smaller proportion of family reunions, plus this year, 18,750 people on humanitarian visas. There is nothing wrong with our system. The debate is about the sheer numbers, and whether that is serving us well now.\nWhat is immigration for? Who is it for? The most curious argument in favour of large population growth is that, somehow, Australians \u2013 those here for generations and those recently settled \u2013 owe it to the rest of the world to populate quickly. Fairfax\u2019s economics correspondent Peter Martin wrote that \u201cthe rest of the world has granted us a licence to use this continent on the implicit understanding that we populate it.\u201d\nReally? Says who? Fellow Fairfax columnist Jessica Irvine wrote that we need to weigh up the \u201cneeds of Australians versus foreigners\u201d in the immigration debate and she had \u201cnever placed the hopes and dreams of Australians so far above those of foreigners that their needs become unimportant\u201d.\nThat\u2019s bewildering. Apart from our humanitarian intake \u2013 which is a duty for an affluent country like ours \u2013 the primary purpose of immigration is to benefit people who already live here, or at least not to worsen their quality of life. The Productivity Commission made that clear , concluding in a 2016 report that it had \u201ctaken the overarching policy objective of immigration to be maximising the wellbeing of existing Australian citizens and permanent residents\u201d.\nWe have benefited enormously from immigration. We are a land of immigrants. We will, and should, keep growing and much of that growth will be newcomers settling here. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t pause a tad now. Just for a bit. Just so mug citizens like me can ask a few questions about the city I love.\nGay Alcorn is a Guardian Australia columnist Topics Australian immigration and asylum Opinion Population Australian politics Melbourne Victoria Victorian politics comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/tony-abbott-s-economic-argument-against-immigration-is-flawed-20180225-p4z1ml.html", "https://www.smh.com.au/national/there-s-a-case-for-immigration-and-it-s-not-about-us-20180314-p4z4bk.html", "https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/migrant-intake/report", "http://www.rossgittins.com/2018/03/immigration-cheap-and-nasty-way-to-grow.html", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-13/victorian-land-schools-growth-corridors-daniel-andrews/9542598", "http://jhps.vic.edu.au/enrolment/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob carr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alcorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:52:34.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "913cf68410a75daa8c4db29370e48123ec468295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3XZlrofKWTgcXAxJdKnoibSrpFGj.MZjVBC4b287SEPkUU2TnhWE2dDe1r_xnhd2_ImTaWZ_D6bdEfejc27OMkG_3MmkxS0_pSCKzhuZwwmKRIh8Xih3j6hOeTpm2nVnNs_2Dn4deqo3jg49xzUZomm3EI2OcWpV94pX6GjAVNsrn8va_NhxFqQE.fkTfSUUpm4KS.XQH.DvY-", "site_full": "www.foxsports.com.au", "site": "foxsports.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "AFL | AFL Ladder, Live Scores, Results &amp; News | Fox Sports | FOX SPORTS", "title": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father", "title_full": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father | Fox Sports", "published": "2018-03-22T12:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1f9ddd729bf424c6aaae331cdff70758", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 9920, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 723, "comments": 0, "shares": 723}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "913cf68410a75daa8c4db29370e48123ec468295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3XZlrofKWTgcXAxJdKnoibSrpFGj.MZjVBC4b287SEPkUU2TnhWE2dDe1r_xnhd2_ImTaWZ_D6bdEfejc27OMkG_3MmkxS0_pSCKzhuZwwmKRIh8Xih3j6hOeTpm2nVnNs_2Dn4deqo3jg49xzUZomm3EI2OcWpV94pX6GjAVNsrn8va_NhxFqQE.fkTfSUUpm4KS.XQH.DvY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Olle", "published": "2018-03-22T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father", "text": "GARY Ablett says his return to Geelong is made all the sweeter by his father\u2019s determination to become more involved with the footy club.

Her brother finally knows why", "text": "By Paul Biegler Updated 24 March 2018 \u2014 12:37am first published 23 March 2018 \u2014 8:00am I found my sister Sian slumped against the chest freezer in the kitchen. The early rays of a hot Melbourne morning were streaming through the French doors and lighting up the mustard fuzz of the carpet tiles. Leunig's poem My Shoe , cut out from The Age , was turning brown on a cloth-covered pin board on the wall, and a Philips portable radio sat on a sideboard, switched off, but tuned to 3LO.\nSian was wearing her black astrakhan coat and Cuban-heeled ankle boots. I was puzzled that she would have fallen asleep there, like that. I put my hand on her shoulder to wake her up but when I touched her it was cold. I still remember my sudden intake of breath; I'd never felt that coldness on a human being.\n\"There's something wrong with Sian,\" was all I could say to Mum when I ran down to her room. When she'd seen my sister for herself, I asked her if Sian, just 18 years old and my only sibling, was dead. Mum's answer came out hesitant, uncertain, as if her mind were prefiguring an enormous bleakness that was still out of conscious reach. \"I think so,\" she said. The shock couldn't quite erase Mum's Welsh lilt, but the sing-song of the valleys got knocked out of her then, pretty much for good.\nPaul Biegler\u2019s sister, Sian, was only 18 when she died.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler It has been 38 years and I don't really want to go back there, but I'm going to because I've got kids, full of life and energy, and I don't want whatever it was that pulled Sian down to creep up on them. Because creep it did. Mum died in 1997 but Dad is still alive, and he says the thing that really sticks is that none of us knew what was going on. I don't want that to be me. And so, after all this time, I've been trying to shine light on a side of my sister that has always been hidden.\nThere was a coroner's inquest and I have the documents, photocopies tinged with sepia. I learnt from the deposition of a 26-year-old woman called Elizabeth that Sian spent her last night on earth in a flat in Brighton Road, St Kilda: \"I saw Sian go on several occasions to the bathroom and I assumed that she was dropping more Tuinal \u2026 Sian appeared to be depressed because her boyfriend had not been in touch with her for a week and she was worried about him.\"\nAdvertisement Tuinal. The capsules look like little red, brown and blue torpedoes, which is kind of apt, considering how many lives they've destroyed. It's a barbiturate, the same thing they squirt into you when you're having an anaesthetic, and was a popular sleeping pill in the 1970s and '80s.\nSian was taking Tuinal, a barbiturate \u2013 \"the same thing they squirt into you when you're having an anaesthetic\".\nPhoto: Getty Images That was until its stats sheet became so awful \u2013 the overdose rate was 20 times higher than for drugs like Valium \u2013 that by the late 1980s, no one could justify prescribing it. The problem with Tuinal was that people would get tolerant to the sleepy euphoria and have to keep upping the dose to get the same kick. But the lethal dose sat stubbornly the same, so the habitual pill-popper, like a fisherman hooking a monster they'd never land, just reeled themselves in, ever closer to goodnight.\nHow do I know all this? I looked it up, sure. But I ended up studying medicine, so I come with professional bona fides, too. In fact, I did advanced training and practised as an emergency physician. It's a job that's all about keeping control in a crisis \u2013 something of a recurring challenge over the years.\nOn the afternoon of February 6, 1980, the day I found my sister, I played golf. I rang up my mate Stephen, who skipped school on that second day of year 12, and we lugged our golf bags down to Elsternwick Golf Club and played nine holes.\nLooking back now it seems bizarre, even callous, but I remind myself that I was 17, and that grief was uncertain, foreign and painful. I didn't know how to do it. The swing of an iron, or a wood, was predictable, familiar. Perhaps there was reassurance from its simple repetition that it would just keep going, and not cut out on me without warning.\nBut, as air always vents to the water's surface, my loss would rise up periodically to remind me of its presence, deep within, mammoth, silent, immovable. At night in bed I'd have sudden moments where I couldn't draw a breath. At school in a maths exam, I excused myself to take a much-needed piss, but when I got to the toilets it wouldn't come. Back in my seat, wound up with a full bladder, I didn't finish the paper.\nPaul Biegler, now at age 55.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler Years later, when I was faithfully recording my dreams for a Jungian analyst, I learnt that Jung himself thought all neuroses are born of illegitimate suffering. I suspect Dr Jung might have seen me as a straggler; I'm 55, and I'm still trying to feel all those feelings properly.\nAnyway, those Tuinals, traded and shared across sticky St Kilda bar tables as \"tuis\", \"chewies\" and \"lollies\", were embedded deep in the drug culture of the time. Prescription drug abuse itself, of course, is timeless. Eighty per cent of overdose deaths examined by the Victorian Coroner in the seven years to 2015 were from prescription drugs, and most of those were drugs in the same classes as Valium and codeine. In 2016, 372 Victorians died of prescription drug overdoses, a hike of more than 25 per cent in six years, and more than double the state's road toll.\nIn the US, opioid overdoses increased 30 per cent in the 14 months to September 2017, according to a report by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. In November, the US President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis called it an epidemic of \"epic proportions\".\nSo the question of why, and how you would know that your own baby-turned-teenager is doing drugs, prescription or otherwise, reaches out across the decades.\nMy first clues in Sian's case come from delving into her innermost thoughts, which would never have reached me in her lifetime, guarded, as they were, in a white wooden box under lock and key. I've carried that box with me, sacrosanct and unopened, for years. Until now. There are bits of rice paper with poems, foolscap sheets with meandering words, unsent letters and hotel meal tickets, among other souvenirs of a short life. It's adolescent, maudlin, threaded with loneliness and the hope of love, hinting at a new relationship here, ebbing away to bleakness and solitude there.\nWhat's unnerving is how this silent stream of desolation flowed hidden under a veneer of normality. And there is also the very conspicuous absence of me, Mum and Dad. Sian's pain is oriented to a world outside the weave of family. We're not a bulwark against loss, we're just missing from the equation, with all hope pinned on the horizon of her peers.\nIn 2017's The MassGeneral Hospital for Children Adolescent Medicine Handbook , three Harvard psychiatrists note the importance of choosing your tribe; friends who do drugs are a major risk factor for substance abuse. Family conflict and a lack of caring adults also figure prominently.\nDid we check any of these boxes? Well, before Mum and Dad split in 1976, there were definitely rows. I do recall the banging of kitchen pots. No violence but, yes, highly audible disharmony. And with my father gone, and my mother tearful and acrimonious over her nightly glass of red, Sian had ample opportunity to slip out her window and into the troubled night.\nElizabeth, Sian's companion on that last night in St Kilda, who deposed so helpfully to the coroner, was forthright on Sian's choice of peer group:\n\"I tried to talk to her about her boyfriend, whom I had known for 10 years, and I tried to tell her that he was an absolute no-hoper and wasn't worth worrying about. Unfortunately Sian was the type of girl who took the unfortunate people of this world under her wing in the vague hope of helping them. She was too kindhearted and sympathetic for her own good.\"\nIn the late '70s, Sian's haunts of choice were the Greyhound Hotel and the Gatwick in St Kilda, the latter home to an erstwhile, and much older, boyfriend whose troubles the white box bears witness to, with scripts for antidepressants and phone numbers for a psych ward.\nBoth institutions, as it happens, were subject to seismic real estate shifts in 2017. The Greyhound, where from all accounts a variety of substances could be bought and sold, was vaporised to make way for apartments, and the Gatwick, a modish private hotel of the art deco era, but latterly home to sundry unfortunates, was sold to Channel Nine to be kitted out for more genteel types on The Block .\nIt would be fair to say Sian's peer milieu fell foul of the Harvard doctors' warnings, with both her preferred public buildings sporting illicit substances in spades. But the Gatwick did not lack caring adults. In July last year, proprietors Rose Banks and Yvette Kelly, who had called the Gatty home since 1971, opened their doors for a day to the public. I heard too late and missed it. But, determined to see where Sian had hung out, I rang photographer Sandy Rogulic, who spent a year among its folk with her camera, snapping the etched faces of hard lives, all with the Gatwick's weathered glory as backdrop.\nOne of Sian\u2019s haunts, St Kilda\u2019s Gatwick boarding house.\nPhoto: Thom Rigney Sandy kindly met me beneath the hotel's iconic portico, and took me on a tour past the dark mahogany of reception, whose windows opened onto flowers like some porthole into Eden, up stately staircases jaded with use, past rooms boarded up to stop squatters availing themselves of the emptiness, down dark corridors and into shared bathrooms studded with 1930s tiles where residents once set off crackers and lit fires on the floor.\nBut the epicentre was a little room, lined with shelves still stacked with the articles of care wielded by Rose and Yvette over all those decades; the towels and linen for their displaced, homeless, drug-affected and abused residents. I had the privilege of meeting both sisters and wondered if Sian ever did, sure that if she had felt their stern but patient embrace, she would have been better for it.\nThings were unravelling for my sister. I come across her school report from year 11. \"This is just not good enough! Sian is skipping classes and leaving school without permission. Unless she conforms she will be asked to leave,\" it reads, ominously. Academic decline is another risk factor on the Harvard doctors' list.\nRecently, the wheels have been turning, ever so creakily, on prevention. The federal government pledged $16 million for a national prescription monitoring system in July, and Victoria passed its anti-doctor-shopping legislation, SafeScript, in October. Codeine-containing drugs became prescription-only last month.\nBut none of this will help if the doctors are dodgy. Sian's GP, who said he didn't know he was referred to as the \"lolly doctor\", had, in the preceding year, prescribed Tuinal to four other young people whose deaths were examined by the coroner. He was investigated by the medical board, struck off for \"infamous conduct\" (nowadays called serious professional misconduct), then reinstated a couple of years later. I saw his obituary in my trawling. He passed away in 2014, at 85. It was peaceful, apparently, after a long illness, and he was a beloved husband and proud father.\nPaul Biegler in 1979 with his mother Beryl, sister Sian and family dog Morgan.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler Sian, of course, who had turned 18 only five months before her death, was never to marry or have a child, turn her nascent love of art, music and poetry into a pastime or career, weather years with the love of family, get smile lines from laughing round the dinner table, or be blessed with the cross-hatched brow of the worried mum. Instead her chair just sits empty at our table. She hovers, in conversation, over the lives of my children. Auntie Sian, spoken of but unseen, never to influence how they grow, or what they think and do.\nPerhaps strangely, it never occurred to me that Sian could have taken her own life on purpose. The coroner was equivocal: \"The evidence adduced does not enable me to say whether such overdose was accidental or otherwise.\" His conundrum still echoes around the nation; in Australia nearly half of the roughly 1400 codeine-related deaths between 2000 and 2013 were accidental.\nHow in hell, though, do you kill yourself by accident? Well, as with Tuinal, people get tolerant to a drug's effects and end up taking too much, or mix it with other drugs and alcohol, or stupidly get behind the wheel. But whether or not Sian's death was intentional, she was, undoubtedly, deeply unhappy, and I guess I'll never really understand why.\nRight at the front of my file on Sian is the autopsy report, which reads:\n7 February 80. Woman. Sian Cathryn BIEGLER. 18 (found dead on \u2026 floor)\nThe body was that of a thin, young woman with a bruise beneath the right side of the chin and a short cut 1cm long. There was no evidence of any deeper damage and the skull and brain all appeared normal. The heart weighed 190g. The myocardium was normal. The coronary arteries showed minimal atheroma \u2026 The mucosa of the stomach was congested and the stomach contained a moderate amount of granular material which was probably ingested tablets \u2026\nThat's what happens when your loved one dies and it's a coroner's case. They become organs, weighed and measured, commented on like specimens in a pathology museum.\nMuch of death shocks and rattles, but coronial deaths mean that on the passage from living, breathing and loving, to nothingness, there is also a clinical carving of flesh, and a resewing for the funeral, all of which reinforces just how little they have become. The stock in trade of the autopsist, valuable as it is, becomes the stuff of nightmares for relatives.\nFor some reason, when my mum received the coroner's documents, it appears she also asked for the photos. I discovered them 20 years ago when I was cleaning out Mum's unit after she died. They were horrible to me then, and I gave them to my dad, who locked them away in his filing cabinet.\nMy dad just turned 80, and it seems I've come of age, because I'm now custodian of the photos. They show Sian on the kitchen floor after the doctor came and rolled her away from the freezer, which is why, because of rigor mortis, her arms are held unnatural, still and upraised, in a pose of helplessness, like those plaster casts of the victims at Pompeii.\nHer hair is spread out from her head on those carpet tiles. Her lips are pinched and colourless. Eyes closed, eyelashes a thin line between the lids. There's no real expression, and if there is it's one of being fed up, exhausted, resigned, over it, goodbye. There is no repose, there is no peace, there is no grateful relinquishing of life's breath. It's just a bad death.\nOne that I'm going to place carefully back in its folder, bury deep within my own filing cabinet, and keep well away from my children, out of harm's way.
