And, it isn\u2019t even done on the sly. At Murgi Patty on Fenwick Bazar Street behind New Market , these birds are openly sold and bought under the shadow of the clock tower. An overwhelming majority of customers are owners of roll, biryani and momo stalls that do brisk business on the city\u2019s streets, serving fares at unbelievable prices. Not just this spot, there are at least two other locations in New Market \u2014 one on Market Street and the other in the market\u2019s fish range \u2014 where sellers and buyers break into frenetic activity with lifeless and listless chicken when the rest of the city is asleep. This 45-60 minutes of business \u2014 whose turnover would run into crores a month \u2014 is so well-entrenched that civic officials and police officers deliberately look the other way. Shortly after 4.30am, the first of many trucks carrying chicken for the wholesale market arrives in the locality. Over the next hour, 20-25 trucks roll into the market, each carrying 1,500-2,000 \u2018live\u2019 chicken. But many among them are dead. They either die of temperature variation during the long hours of travel; or get suffocated in cramped cages used to transport them. Some also suffer from coccidiosis or chronic respiratory disease. The chicken are sorted out after unloading with dead and sick ones lined up on the road. Soon, the blacktop disappears as hundreds of motionless chicken pave the street and buyers converge from all over and strike deals for the dead meat. They all converse with a well-built man in the mid-30s. TOI reporters, too, approached him, posing as caterers looking for cheap meat. \u201cIt will cost you Rs 70 a kg,\u201d the man said, waving his arm at the insipid chicken. Live chicken sells for Rs 100 a kg in the market. He had a tip too. The dead and extremely sick chicken needed to be dressed immediately as transporting them could be risky given the sudden vigil on such birds following the chief minister\u2019s warning on Wednesday. All around, cash exchanged hands and the motionless birds were carted away in cycle vans. One of the buyers said he worked in a mid-rung hotel. \u201cMost of the chicken are picked up by small hotels and roadside eateries,\u201d he said. A few paces away where Fenwick Bazar Street met Market Street, a crowd had gathered before a shop where sick chicken were being dressed and sold. A couple of lay dead. Here, too, the rate was Rs 70 a kg for sick chicken. Abdul Latif, another chicken retailer in the area, said he sold them at Rs 65 a kg to regular customers. \u201cThere is no harm in consuming these chicken. They have either just died on the way or will expire soon,\u201d he reasoned. One of the buyers who has a biryani stall said he had been serving these chicken for over a year without any complaints from his customers. \u201cI sell chicken biryani for Rs 65 a plate. That includes a breast or leg piece. If I were to buy live chicken that sells for Rs 100 a kg, I would not have been able to do business,\u201d he said. Another few paces down Market Street and one lands at the fish range inside New Market. Here, too, ailing and dead chicken are sold.

And, it isn\u2019t even done on the sly.\nAt Murgi Patty on Fenwick Bazar Street behind New Market , these birds are openly sold and bought under the shadow of the clock tower. An overwhelming majority of customers are owners of roll, biryani and momo stalls that do brisk business on the city\u2019s streets, serving fares at unbelievable prices.\nNot just this spot, there are at least two other locations in New Market \u2014 one on Market Street and the other in the market\u2019s fish range \u2014 where sellers and buyers break into frenetic activity with lifeless and listless chicken when the rest of the city is asleep. This 45-60 minutes of business \u2014 whose turnover would run into crores a month \u2014 is so well-entrenched that civic officials and police officers deliberately look the other way.\nShortly after 4.30am, the first of many trucks carrying chicken for the wholesale market arrives in the locality. Over the next hour, 20-25 trucks roll into the market, each carrying 1,500-2,000 \u2018live\u2019 chicken. But many among them are dead. They either die of temperature variation during the long hours of travel; or get suffocated in cramped cages used to transport them. Some also suffer from coccidiosis or chronic respiratory disease.\nThe chicken are sorted out after unloading with dead and sick ones lined up on the road. Soon, the blacktop disappears as hundreds of motionless chicken pave the street and buyers converge from all over and strike deals for the dead meat. They all converse with a well-built man in the mid-30s.\nTOI reporters, too, approached him, posing as caterers looking for cheap meat. \u201cIt will cost you Rs 70 a kg,\u201d the man said, waving his arm at the insipid chicken. Live chicken sells for Rs 100 a kg in the market.\nHe had a tip too. The dead and extremely sick chicken needed to be dressed immediately as transporting them could be risky given the sudden vigil on such birds following the chief minister\u2019s warning on Wednesday.\nAll around, cash exchanged hands and the motionless birds were carted away in cycle vans. One of the buyers said he worked in a mid-rung hotel. \u201cMost of the chicken are picked up by small hotels and roadside eateries,\u201d he said.\nA few paces away where Fenwick Bazar Street met Market Street, a crowd had gathered before a shop where sick chicken were being dressed and sold. A couple of lay dead. Here, too, the rate was Rs 70 a kg for sick chicken.\nAbdul Latif, another chicken retailer in the area, said he sold them at Rs 65 a kg to regular customers. \u201cThere is no harm in consuming these chicken. They have either just died on the way or will expire soon,\u201d he reasoned.\nOne of the buyers who has a biryani stall said he had been serving these chicken for over a year without any complaints from his customers. \u201cI sell chicken biryani for Rs 65 a plate. That includes a breast or leg piece. If I were to buy live chicken that sells for Rs 100 a kg, I would not have been able to do business,\u201d he said.\nAnother few paces down Market Street and one lands at the fish range inside New Market. Here, too, ailing and dead chicken are sold. But the sellers here have become wary of strangers since last week. \u201cI don\u2019t sell cheap chicken to strangers,\u201d one of the traders said.

He\u2019s been doing well both in domestic and international cricket. This season there will be added pressure on him,\u201d Chawla, who is also Kuldeep\u2019s Uttar Pradesh teammate in domestic cricket, said. \nKuldeep has an ability to soak pressure, something that has reflected in his bowling for India and Chawla feels the chinaman will do well. \n\u201cWhen he came into the scene for the first time, he was quite raw and there was not much of expectations from him. But this season, when he enters the field there will be a lot of expectations. He will definitely do well with the kind of bowler he is,\u201d Chawla said on the sidelines of a KKR promotional programme. \nKKR\u2019s \u2018mystery spinner\u2019 Sunil Narine was once again reported for suspect action during the Pakistan Super League but Chawla backed the West Indian to do well for KKR. \n\u201cThe best thing is the way he comes back after that (reported for suspect action). The effectiveness is the same. It\u2019s just that the team has started playing him a bit on the safer side. When they play you on the safer side, it becomes a bit tough for the bowlers to pick up wickets. \n\u201cBut at the same time, it is an opportunity for us to take wickets as batsmen take chances against us. So me or Kuldeep, we get chance to pick up wickets. My role will always stay the same \u2014 to take wickets. When I joined KKR, Sunil was taking wickets and our combination worked really well.\u201d \nChawla said the team was looking forward to playing under the new captain Dinesh Karthik . \n\u201cI have not that played much under him. He is one of the experienced campaigners and who has done really well. The way he\u2019s playing right now, the confidence will definitely help him to lead the side well,\u201d Chawla said referring to the Karthik\u2019s last-ball six against Bangladesh in the Tri-nation T20 final in Sri Lanka. \nKKR also have roped in three U-19 World Cup winning cricketers in Shubman Gill, Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. \n\u201cWe all have seen their performances while winning the U-19 World Cup. All of them are top level cricketers. Shubman Gill is one amazing talent, and one to look out for. He looks different, the confidence when he walks in is different,\u201d Chawla said, showering praise on Gill. \nThe programme was also attended by Ishank Jaggi who helped KKR enter the Qualifier 2 by stitching a 36-run stand with then skipper Gautam Gambhir in a rain-affected game in Bengaluru last season.

The fast bowler\u2019s contract had been held back pending investigation into the possibility that he had received money from a man through a woman based in Pakistan. \nWhile the Kolkata Police is probing the criminal charges against Shami, including Section 307 (attempt to murder), based on a complaint filed by his wife Hasin Jahan, the BCCI restricted its inquiry solely to breaching the anti-corruption code for the players. \nThe Committee of Administrators (CoA) had asked the ACU chief Neeraj Kumar to look into whether Shami had taken any money from a certain England-based Mohammed bhai, sent to him through a Pakistani woman, Alishba, in Dubai. \nOn Thursday, the BCCI release said: \u201cThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India appointed Committee of Administrators had requested Mr Neeraj Kumar, former Police Commissioner of Delhi and Head of BCCI Anti-Corruption Unit, to investigate the allegations against Mohd. Shami insofar as they pertain to the provisions of the BCCI Anti-Corruption Code. \n\u201cMr Neeraj Kumar has submitted his confidential report to the CoA. Based on the conclusions in the said report, the CoA is of the view that no further actions/proceedings under the BCCI anti-corruption code are warranted in the matter. \n\u201cFor this reason, the BCCI shall proceed with offering a Grade \u2018B\u2019 annual retainership contract to Mohd. Shami.\u201d \nThe speedster now joins KL Rahul, Umesh Yadav , Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Hardik Pandya, Ishant Sharma and Dinesh Karthik in Grade B on Rs 3 crore per annum. And the BCCI clean chit also clears the decks for him to resume his association with his IPL franchise, Delhi Daredevils. The franchise had been waiting for the cricket board directive in this regard. \nAfter the BCCI verdict, Shami re-tweeted a DD post that said: \u201cWe\u2019re glad to hear the verdict! @MdShami11 has been cleared to play by the @BCCI.\u201d Talking to The Indian Express, Daredevils CEO Hemant Dua, too, welcomed the decision. \u201cWe are excited. You know it\u2019s for the (game of) cricket, not just for DD but more for cricket. He is a great bowler and he gets to go. We never had any doubts about that (on Shami). He is welcomed to join the DD camp, from March 27-28 (at Feroz Shah Kotla), when we start. We are very happy for him,\u201d Dua told this paper. \nMUST READ | Mohammed Shami-Hasin Jahan: How the sordid saga unfolded \nThe Daredevils exercised the Right-to-Match card option at the IPL 2018 auction to retain Shami for Rs 3 crore. \nLast week the Committee of Administrators chief Vinod Rai had told The Indian Express: \u201cAs per the recorded phone conversation, he (Shami) talks about taking money from some extraneous sources, from one Mohammed bhai. Now, the handbook for players specifically says that if they receive money from some extraneous sources, they are required to inform the BCCI. So we are asking him, what\u2019s the money for? The ACU will look into this. Rest we will follow the police inquiry.\u201d \nOff the field, however, a legal battle awaits the cricketer, as the Kolkata Police has booked Shami and his family members under non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code. Shami\u2019s mother Anjuman-Ara-Begum, brother Hasib Ahmed, Hasib\u2019s wife Shama and Shabina Ahjum, Shami\u2019s sister are among those who have been named in the FIR. The FIR has been lodged under section 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder), 376(rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. \nHasin, meanwhile, reportedly has sought an audience with the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as she said she wanted to have the chief minister\u2019s support in her \u201cfight\u201d against Shami. She has also recorded a confidential statement before a judicial magistrate.

Choudhary, in an email to BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, and copied to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) and other BCCI officials have also mentioned another article that described Gupta\u2019s take on the actress as \u201cSlut-shaming Deepika Padukone.\u201d \nQuestioning the BCCI\u2019s selection process that also involved recruitment firm Korn Ferry, Choudhary wrote: \u201cA simple search on the internet, revealed the following stories mentioning the candidate selected for the post we are presently concerned with, regarding an article that the person authored, the content of which is for everyone to see.\u201d \nThe two articles refer to the controversy that had started after The Times of India had tweeted a Deepika Padukone video with the caption: \u201cOMG! Deepika Padukone\u2019s cleavage show\u201d. To this, Deepika had responded with: \u201cYES! I am a Woman. I have breasts AND a cleavage! You got a problem!!??\u201d. \nGupta had defended The Times of India in an article with a headline \u201cDear Deepika, our point of view\u2026\u201d where she wrote: \u201cDeepika, just for the record, we do not zoom into a woman\u2019s vagina or show her nipples\u2026 What about all the times, and there have been many, when you have flaunted your body off screen \u2014 while dancing on stage, posing for magazine covers, or doing photo ops at movie promotional functions? What \u2018role\u2019 do you play there? So why the hypocrisy?\u201d \nAsked about Choudhary\u2019s objections, Gupta told The Indian Express: \u201cI really have no clue about it and I don\u2019t want to comment anything on it.\u201d \nKorn Ferry\u2019s candidate report on Priya Gupta, accessed by The Indian Express, gives the executive evolution, contact information, education, compensation package, personal and career details of the candidate.

This constitutes almost 95% of the television market. The government had imposed 10% duty on open cell panels in the last Budget as compared to nil which was earlier. \n\nThe industry was lobbying against the imposition of this duty and leading players like Samsung and Panasonic had earlier this month increased prices by up to 6% while others like Sony and LG had planned similar hikes for the new models which are rolled out in April. \n\nPanasonic India CEO Manish Sharma said the government\u2019s decision to revise the basic custom duty on open cell panels to 5% brings back the emphasis on \u2018Make in India\u2019 vision which will drive momentum and develop new capacities for television manufacturing within India. \n\n\u201cGoing forward, the consumer electronics industry can look forward to a developed manufacturing ecosystem whilst creating job opportunities,\u201d Sharma said. \n\nA senior industry executive said the companies will now try to absorb the impact of 5% taxation on open cell panels to boost demand, since television sales has not been growing since last October. \n\nSharma said with the new models now getting rolled out, the price increase, if any, will not be significant. \u201cWe will try to absorb the impact. With 5% duty, the overall impact on television manufacturing cost will be about 2.5%. We will make all efforts of not letting this passed to consumers to boost demand,\u201d he said. \n\nIn case of open cell panels, they are required to be finally assembled in the country to make the LED TV panel which is the heart of the LED televisions. Companies like Samsung, LG and Panasonic had started using this route for last two months and had invested on open cell assembling units. This was done after the government had increased custom duty on finished television sets and finished television panels to 20% and 15% respectively. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manish sharma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panasonic india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panasonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:30:32.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 221, "moreResultsAvailable": 211, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746428104&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3AKolkata&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 861, "extra": {"place": "Kolkata", "country": "IN", "lat": "22.572646", "lng": "88.36389500000001"}}
