The concept? To provide a sumptuous feast to the most vulnerable of Paris while also battling food waste. \nDon\u2019t talk to Bottura about charity. For the only chef in Italy to earn three Michelin stars, his chain of restaurants \u2013 the Refettorii \u2013 is above all a community project. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to recreate a soup kitchen where you have to stand in line. At the Refettorio , we serve them as clientele should be treated, with consideration and dignity,\u201d Bottura told FRANCE 24. \nIn Milan, Modena, London, Rio and, as of March 15, Paris, the most vulnerable will not have to accept food handouts or face the frequently dehumanising soup kitchens. At Bottura\u2019s Refettorio \u2013 which translates as \"recuperate\" or \"restore\"\u2013 they are invited to enjoy a delicious meal carefully prepared by a professional chef in a warm, convivial environment surrounded by exquisite artwork. The Refettorio in Paris opened its doors on March 15, 2018. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul French photographer JR (pictured right) came up with the idea of bringing the Refettorio to Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul The hands of Chef Massimo Bottura are pictured on the plates and wall of the Refettorio in Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul Renowned French chefs Alain Ducasse (pictured left) and Yannick Alleno (pictured right) were in the kitchen for the launch of the Refettorio in Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul \"Beauty restores the soul\". In each of his community kitchens, Bottura has sought to make beauty an indispensible element of his cuisine. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul \n\u201cOn the opening day of our Refettorio in London, a 92-year-old woman told me it was the most beautiful place she had been to in her life. For her, we had created a community. And that\u2019s the very essence of the project. We restore dignity for the forgotten with a stunning dining experience,\u201d the chef said. \nWaste not, want not \n\u201cDo you know what the most important ingredient in a kitchen is? Culture!\u201d Bottura exclaims. \nYet in a world where 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted each year, the link between a cultural experience and cuisine isn\u2019t always obvious. \n\u201cFrom culture comes knowledge, and from knowledge comes awareness, and from awareness comes action. The Refettori aren\u2019t soup kitchens, because in our kitchens we\u2019re not working with urgency. Our meals are a cultural, hopefully life-changing experience. We\u2019re trying to construct a better future. There are more than 860 million people who don\u2019t have enough to eat: the goal isn\u2019t to produce more, but to waste less,\u201d the chef said. \nFor Bottura, 55, a native of the northern Italian city of Modena, the birthplace of \u201ccucina povera\u201d or the art of simple cooking, the fight against food waste is almost innate. From his childhood kitchen table to his community kitchens, not throwing away food is instinctive. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t throw away bread \u2013 that\u2019s sacrilege! Even stale bread can be used to make a delicious recipe, like bread pudding or pesto,\u201d explains Bottura, whose Proustian madeleine cookie recipe calls for one cup of warm milk, bread crumbs and a dash of coffee. \n\u2018You make garbage taste so delicious\u2019 \nCooking with surplus ingredients is an art that Bottura has mastered. \u201cYou make garbage taste so delicious,\u201d the American late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel joked after inviting Bottura to cook on his show in February with leftovers found around the studio. \nThe subtitle of Bottura\u2019s most recent book of recipes, Bread is Gold , more or less sums up the chef\u2019s entire philosophy: \"Extraordinary meals with ordinary ingredients\". \nBottura was trained by the best. \u201cMy fight against food waste is an homage to my grandmother,\u201d he explained. \nGrowing up, food was no laughing matter in the Bottura household. They grew it, cooked it and ate it. \n\u201cI come from a large family. We were at least 10 at every meal \u2013 my brothers and sisters, my cousins, my grandparents, my friends. We grew up with the idea of being together at the table. It was a moment where we could talk to each other, share ideas, dream,\u201d Bottura recalled. \nHis career as a lawyer (\u201cto make my father happy\u201d) was short-lived. Since then, Bottura has been no stranger to success. The Osteria Francescana, his three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Modena is fully booked five months in advance. Want to reserve a table? Prepare to beg. \nAfter winning the \u201c Best Chef in the World \u201d title in 2016, Bottura has nothing left to prove. Yet despite his myriad of awards and honours, he isn\u2019t content serving just the rich and famous. \n\u2018Why should art and fine dining be reserved for the wealthy?\u2019 \n\u201cWhy should art and fine dining be reserved for the wealthy?\u201d Bottura demanded. When reminded of the massive gap between his wealthy clientele at the Osteria Francescana and the more vulnerable patrons at his Refettori community kitchens, Bottura replies matter-of-factly. \u201cThe ingredients may change but the process is still the same.\u201d \n\u201cWho says that a chef should keep his mouth shut behind his stove? That\u2019s absurd,\u201d Bottura\u2019s friend, the Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, exclaimed in a Netflix documentary on the Italian. \nBottura is also a famous activist. In 2010, while hiking in a regional park along the Po River, he came across a ranger who deplored the state of the neglect of the wetlands. The chef kicked up such a fuss that the local government eventually invested \u20ac16 million to restore the park. \nBottura, who is also an advocate of Italy\u2019s Slow Food movement (a group that promotes local food and traditional cooking), was approached in 2012 by a consortium of parmesan cheese producers. A string of earthquakes in Italy\u2019s Emilia-Romagna region had left more than 300,000 wheels of the famous cheese damaged. Bottura came up with the idea of transforming the recipe for cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) into a risotto that replaced the traditional sheep-based pecorino cheese with parmesan. Two months later all of the damaged wheels had been sold. \nThe beginning of Refettorio \nIn 2015, the organisers of the World Expo in Milan invited Bottura to talk on the theme, \u201cFeed the planet\u201d. The Italian chef, however, took it one step further. After founding the non-profit Food for the Soul, he opened his first Refettorio community kitchen in a suburb of Milan. Some of the world\u2019s greatest chefs flocked to support him, preparing meals for the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations using only surplus ingredients. A cuisine and design enthusiast, Bottura also invited artists and architects to help create a warm and inspiring venue. Mens sano in corpore sano , or \u201ca healthy mind in a healthy body\u201d, was his motto. The Refettorio provides a fine dining experience for the most vulnerable populations. \u00a9 Food For Soul To fight against food waste, only surplus ingredients are used in the creation of dishes. \u00a9 Food For Soul Bottura believes that culture is the most important ingredient in any kitchen. \u00a9 Food For Soul \u201cFrom culture comes knowledge, and from knowledge comes awareness, and from awareness comes action,\" said Bottura. \u00a9 Food For Soul \nThe initiative was such a success that the Refettorio, which was meant to shut its doors at the end of the World Expo, remained open. Even better, the model has since been exported abroad. In France, it was the French photographer JR who came up with the idea of launching a Refettorio in Paris while at a dinner party hosted by his friend Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rial, CEO of the travel agency Voyageurs du Monde. Rial is now president of the Refettorio in Paris. \n\u201cJR told me about Massimo Bottura\u2019s Refettorii around the world, and proposed launching one in Paris. I thought it was a great idea: restoring dignity to the impoverished through quality food, a quality environment and the quality of the chefs,\u201d Rial said. \nEvery evening, from Monday through Friday, a team of five staff, including one young chef, prepare approximately 100 meals in the Crypt Restaurant beneath the Madeleine church in Paris\u2019s 8th arrondissement for a clientele made up of migrants and the homeless. The kitchen will regularly be taken over by some of the most famous names in French cuisine, including Alain Ducasse, Yannick All\u00e9no, Jean Imbert, Olivier Rollinger and Michel Bras. \n\u201cChefs can no longer content themselves with cooking in their restaurants. They have a responsibility to the future of global food security,\u201d Bottura argues. On his left arm, a tattoo of the words \u201cNo more excuses\u201d serves to remind us of that.

The Made in France trade show - Premi\u00e8re vision The crafts and trades represented are accessory manufacturing, components, garment and knitwear manufacturing, fabric enhancement and raw materials. In addition, service providers, professional associations and training organisations will also be represented. Vocational training will be this edition's central theme, notably via the presentation of studio work by the Trans-faire workshops, the Atelier du Haut-Anjou and the flexible materials section (shoe and leather accessory makers, upholsterers and trunk-makers) of the Compagnons du Devoir and Tour de France craft associations, as well as via a showcase by nine international designers.The Rencontres du Made in France conferences, organised in partnership with the French Fashion Institute (IFM), will focus on the perennial issue of recruitment and training, at a time when the French government intends to review apprenticeship rules. While France's textile and apparel exports are growing, 45% of entrepreneurs say they struggle to hire skilled workers, and as a result have to cut back on output.One of the conferences will be hosted by the IFM's Dominique Jacomet, with panellists Delphine de Canecaude (Twenty Magazin), Jean-Luc Fran\u00e7ois (Groupement de la Fabrication Fran\u00e7aise) and Olivier Toussaint (of the Le Club des CHO think-tank).Four other conferences are scheduled, their themes ranging from the redirection of sourcing towards France, to the challenges of company acquisitions, the role that a digital approach can play for French craftsmanship, and how French manufacturing is regarded by foreign buyers. Made in France Premi\u00e8re Vision 2017 In 2015, French textile manufacturers' revenues were worth \u20ac7.2 billion, providing 5,700 jobs, while the French apparel industry was worth nearly \u20ac8 billion, with 39,826 jobs.

The 49-year-old, who claimed to be at the Bataclan concert hall where Islamic State attackers killed 90 people, had already been found guilty of fraud on three different occasions. Before her arrest in February she had also been holding a paid job at a charity for victims of the gun and bomb attacks in which jihadists murdered a total of 130 people. In her claim to police in February 2016 the woman told of \"bullets whistling past her ears\" at the Bataclan, but investigators found she had faked a receipt for the concert ticket and other documents to build up her claim for compensation. On top of the 25,000 euros ($31,000) she claimed from the state's FGTI compensation fund for terror victims, she received more than 13,000 euros from the French health service. She is not the first person to be caught impersonating a victim of the carnage at the national stadium and Paris nightspots on November 13, 2015, France's worst attacks since World War II. Two people have been found guilty of fraud and another 11 of attempting to swindle the FGTI out of compensation, according to the fund. In December Cedric Rey, an ambulance driver, was sentenced to six months in jail for pretending to have been at the Bataclan when he was not even in Paris at the time of the attack. He had described in vivid detail to the media how he escaped death when a pregnant woman \"took the bullets meant for me\" -- only for the story to be exposed as a lie.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bataclan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T11:38:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3632d1897175d301ff64c25f85002949ce238d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SPY4KAcu.ktQ0iC_wnF0AHEow4ZKhSyg.BX1nrdZTIQQtVmK2QiKZy6iQfT8XdXVVXDxjb1DcKMPd_AzFnnEoPKT8LzeSadayDovYe2ZN1Aqrv8SEwd5K2lzVwxNEqZQLGjPfCPjPCfQ--", "site_full": "au.fashionnetwork.com", "site": "fashionnetwork.com", "site_section": "http://au.fashionmag.com/rss/feed/au,1.xml", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "News - FashionNetwork.com Australia", "title": "Fall 2018 was reportedly the most racially diverse catwalk season", "title_full": "Fall 2018 was reportedly the most racially diverse catwalk season", "published": "2018-03-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.fashiongroup.com/m/bb80/c23e/63fb/c426/8c86/6e24/dea1/b213/8531/5b41/400x250/5b41.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3632d1897175d301ff64c25f85002949ce238d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SPY4KAcu.ktQ0iC_wnF0AHEow4ZKhSyg.BX1nrdZTIQQtVmK2QiKZy6iQfT8XdXVVXDxjb1DcKMPd_AzFnnEoPKT8LzeSadayDovYe2ZN1Aqrv8SEwd5K2lzVwxNEqZQLGjPfCPjPCfQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fall 2018 was reportedly the most racially diverse catwalk season", "text": "Home \u203a News \u203a Industry \u203a Fall 2018 was reportedly the most racially diverse catwalk season Fall 2018 was reportedly the most racially diverse catwalk season 23 March 2018 More women of color than ever before took to the catwalks of New York, London, Milan and Paris during \"Fashion Month\" earlier this year, a new report claims. See catwalk Prada - Fall-Winter2018 - Womenswear - Milan - \u00a9 PixelFormula According to The Fashion Spot's latest Runway Diversity Report, 32.5% of the models cast to walk in the Fall/Winter 2018 shows this February and March were women of color. The figure represents a 2.3% increase from the previous Spring 2018 season. Notable appearances included supermodel Anok Yai, who, upon opening the Prada show in February, became the first black woman to do so for 20 years. Overall, New York was found to be the most racially diverse fashion city during the Fall 2018 season, followed by London, Paris and finally, Milan.Transgender and non-binary models also saw an increase in catwalk appearances this season, with 56 transgender models and eight non-binary models walking in a total of 52 shows. New York, Paris and London all featured more transgender and non-binary appearances than the last season.However, when it comes to size, it seems the fashion industry is far from being diverse. Although plus-size models such as Ashley Graham and Candice Huffine have seen their profiles skyrocket recently, according to The Fashion Spot, merely 30 plus-size models walked in the Fall Fashion Month shows -- down from 38 last season. Similarly, the number of women aged 50 plus also declined compared to last season, with the total standing at 13 models across all four cities -- 14 fewer than Spring 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anok yai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:30:31.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "site_full": "www.infoconcert.com", "site": "infoconcert.com", "site_section": "http://www.infoconcert.com/rss/news.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Infoconcert - News", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "title_full": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://statics-infoconcert.digitick.com/media/artiste/artiste_suite/details/thom_yorke2018_120x150.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22927, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "text": "23/03/2018 RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !
