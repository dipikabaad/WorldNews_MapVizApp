During the commotion, Seow managed to flee from the scene, police added. \nLee succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. \nSeow will be charged in court on Monday for unlawful possession of a firearm. He faces life imprisonment if convicted. \nCommenting on the case, Criminal Investigation Department Director Tan Chye Hee said: \u201cI would like to express my utmost gratitude to the Royal Malaysia Police for their efforts to locate and arrest the suspect, for this serious case involving the use of firearms in Singapore. \n\"The arrest and extradition of the suspect after 38 years on the run would not be possible without the strong support from the Royal Malaysia Police, our closest crime-fighting partner.

Dr Koh also appeared before the committee at the public hearing on Friday (Mar 23).\nIn her written representation, which she stressed that she was submitting in a personal capacity, Dr Koh mentioned how attempts at exerting foreign influence over Singapore \u201care not new\u201d. \u201cWhat has and can change are the foreign entities that seek to do so, their objectives, methods and the stakes involved.\u201d\nFurther justifications for her suggestion include the fact that elections and national referendums are occasions when all voting-age citizens engage in consequential political decision-making. \u201cThese are important exercises of popular sovereignty and self-determination that must not be undermined either by foreign entities or even by how we design our political institutions and processes.\u201d\nThe availability of Internet-based media also means that communication of any material can spread with much greater ease and speed than before.\n \u201cWhile the credibility of these materials will vary based on readers\u2019 assessment of who might have created or circulated them, the key point here is that the identities of those who do so can remain anonymous or masked behind pseudonyms.\n\u201cMore critically, it is the design feature of the Internet that there is no single point of control and oversight; that there is no single source of content and no single kill-switch for the system and the material on it,\" said Dr Koh.\nHOW IT WORKS\nDr Koh highlighted several ways in which the Election Media Monitoring Commission could be set up.\nFirstly, it should be empowered through state legislation to monitor any media content that it deems and establishes to be election-related, as well as whether it is generated by foreign entities and individuals, she wrote in her written submission.\nIt will also examine the content for fabricated information or material, and whether it threatens good order and social harmony from the period that a writ of election is issued until the final polling result is declared by the Returning Officer in the case of an election or from the time notice of a referendum is issued till its conclusion.\nSecondly, it should comprise an odd number of former senior judges and professors who have no interest and have never been a member of any political party. Naturalised citizens will also not be allowed on the commission \u201cto avoid any risk of the questioning\u201d of judgement, said Dr Koh.\nMembers will be nominated and then appointed by parliamentarians six months after the start of each parliamentary term with the commission\u2019s monitoring activities taking place during all parliamentary elections, including general elections, by-elections, presidential elections and national referendums.\nThirdly, Dr Koh recommended that the commission be empowered by legislation to tap on all the resources of the state for its monitoring of election-related material. These will include intelligence and cybersecurity agencies of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Defence and IMDA.\nThe commission should be supported by a secretariat from the Elections Department, added Dr Koh.\nUpon its set-up, the commission should create a body of policy to guide its activities. These will include areas such as establishing the circulation threshold for the commission to decide if any material is election-related and has gained traction enough to shape public opinion. Dr Koh suggested for this threshold, which could differ for different types of communications, be reviewed at the start of each new term of the commission.\nWhile the commission should have mechanisms to monitor election-related media, she said it should also have a hotline that allows for the public to share material they think the commission should consider for scrutiny.\nIt should also establish its protocol for tapping a centralised task force for investigations, and how to make known its findings publicly and immediately.\nBy signalling to readers the likelihood of a foreign-sourced material, Singaporean voters can \u201cmake an informed choice\u201d about whether they wish to take the material seriously. The commission will signal with an advisory that further circulation is prohibited with penalties for not abiding by the prohibition.\nThe commission will, however, stop short of suggesting that other penalties be placed upon foreign entities for such material as that may lie outside Singapore\u2019s jurisdiction and in the realm of foreign policy, Dr Koh said.\n\u201cWith the guiding principle that the monitoring system is to ensure that Singapore\u2019s democracy and political institutions are not undermined, these protocols must also be designed and run in ways that uphold the spirit of democracy.\n\u201cThis system is on allowing voters to decide what to read and how seriously to take the material with the best knowledge available at the time on whether it is an attempt at influencing public sentiment by foreign entities, and especially if it is by using fabricated information,\u201d said Dr Koh.\n\u201cTo borrow a phrase, it is important that the cure is not worse than the disease.\u201d\nWHY FOCUS ON ELECTION-RELATED, FOREIGN-GENERATED MATERIALS\nIn her written representation, Dr Koh also explained why she restricted her submission to the spread of deliberate online falsehoods by foreign actors within the context of a parliamentary or presidential election, or a referendum in Singapore.\nFor one, she cited the presence of \u201cstrict rules for the regulation of mass media, both Internet-based and all other platforms\u201d that are designed to \u201cban and block material that can sow discord, threaten internal security in Singapore as well as material that may offend the sensibilities of citizens\u201d.\nThese include the Broadcasting Act, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, the Films Act, the Public Meetings and Entertainment Act and the Undesirable Publications Act.\nBut Dr Koh also stressed the challenge to respond to the threat of DOFs \u201cin a way that does not curb the freedom of expression much further or create an instinct of dependency by citizens on the government\u201d.\n\u201cThe default of Singapore\u2019s governance system must be to encourage the development of informed, discerning citizens, who strive not to give offence or take offence even within the cultural diversity that we find among ourselves.\u201d\nDr Koh also cautioned against recommending a solution that \u201clocks ourselves in a virtual communications prison\u201d or overreacting to the extent that it drives Singapore away from its position as an open and integral node of the global economy and community.\nCommittee member Dr Janil Puthucheary, who is also Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information, questioned the rationale behind Dr Koh\u2019s decision to restrict her suggestion to election periods. He pointed out that foreign actors who want to spread deliberate online falsehoods may not constrain themselves to a specific time.\nDr Koh agreed, acknowledging that there could be issues that require the Government to act outside election periods. However, she explained that her submission was focused on dealing with what she described as a \u201cnew threat\u201d, which is related to \u201cforeign interference during a time when citizens are making consequential political decisions\u201d.\nDuring her oral submission, Dr Koh also referred to points made by others, such as Singapore Management University\u2019s law school dean Goh Yihan , and noted that there could be gaps in the existing legal framework.\nHowever, she maintained that there remains many tools, \u201cwhich seem to be very efficiently mobilised\u201d in dealing with the threat of fake news at the moment.\nMinister of Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam asked about Dr Koh\u2019s suggestion for the commission to put out an advisory to a media content that it deemed to be a falsehood generated by foreign actors, instead of taking it down immediately. He questioned the rationale and purpose in allowing a deliberate online falsehood time to be circulated.\nTo that, Dr Koh said she was echoing a point about balance made by National University of Singapore\u2019s (NUS) law professor Thio Li-ann .\n\u201cIf you take down, it makes it even more attractive to read. People will be looking for it. In the Internet age, that\u2019s not entirely foolproof.\u201d\nBy sticking an advisory that prohibits further circulation as the commission confirms whether the material contains falsehood, it will \u201callow for a process of deliberation\u201d. She added that \u201cthere will be citizens that will need to be convinced in their hearts and minds firstly that it is false\u201d and the Government will need to provide this space.\nHowever, she stressed that when it involves an \u201cabsolute, clear data point that is completely false\u201d, there is \u201cno purpose\u201d in allowing it to be circulated.\nLastly, the analyst noted that her considerations undergird the \u201chonest advertising\u201d approach that global Internet and social media companies are proposing. However, Singapore should not rely on these companies, such as Twitter or Facebook, given that it has \u201clittle leverage\u201d over them.\n\u201cWe can only hope that these companies do adopt the strategy due to pressure from their larger markets but we cannot rely on it,\u201d she said.\nSource: CNA/sk", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gillian koh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "koh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "institute of policy studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:26:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "372f3ce7d3f76994b66c157b7d127743a2baccbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXimOiYDtYzyOLgQZr.ENjRvx7aajtUaHBvALmP1gyl.chmtSKeSHjcS2GGz6gL_i7ycAuXSZgn2N02fXqdNky9PEGU.jTonXZomAaDzfAi0fmKXRVE_Sj3ib", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "Breaking News, Singapore News, World and Asia - Channel NewsAsia", "title": "Reliability on Bukit Panjang LRT to 'improve significantly', but won't solve bumpiness issues: LTA", "title_full": "Reliability on Bukit Panjang LRT to 'improve significantly', but won't solve bumpiness issues: LTA - Channel NewsAsia", "published": "2018-03-23T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/8120052/16x9/991/529/d300e836117d8cd848e978c6352f26b9/lo/lrt-file-photo-4---1676734.png", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 6036, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 130, "comments": 0, "shares": 130}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "372f3ce7d3f76994b66c157b7d127743a2baccbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXimOiYDtYzyOLgQZr.ENjRvx7aajtUaHBvALmP1gyl.chmtSKeSHjcS2GGz6gL_i7ycAuXSZgn2N02fXqdNky9PEGU.jTonXZomAaDzfAi0fmKXRVE_Sj3ib", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Noor Farhan", "published": "2018-03-23T12:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reliability on Bukit Panjang LRT to 'improve significantly', but won't solve bumpiness issues: LTA", "text": "SINGAPORE: While the upcoming replacement of LRT vehicles and renewal of signalling systems on the Bukit Panjang LRT line will not address bumpiness issues, the proposed renewal works will still improve passenger service, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has said.\nFixing the bumpiness, which has long been a bugbear of commuters, would require tearing down and rebuilding the tracks - which means the line needs to be shut down for a long period, LTA said.\n\u201cThe electrical and mechanical issues from the train are something we know from the past few years of disruption issues and we want to tackle these head on,\u201d said LTA chief executive Ngien Hoon Ping, on the sidelines of a signing ceremony for the Bukit Panjang LRT renewal with manufacturer Bombardier on Friday (Mar 23).\nLTA chief executive Ngien Hoon Pin (centre, left), with Richard Hunter, Rail Control Solutions president at Bombardier Transportation, at the signing ceremony on Mar 23. (Photo: Noor Farhan) The replacement of 19 LRT vehicles with new ones that have better air-conditioning, as well as installing of the new Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system, is aimed at improving ride experience, while addressing disruption issues faced in the past.\nRENEWING WITH LEAST DISRUPTION\n Aware of bumpiness issues faced by commuters, Mr Ngien said that those can only be fixed by closing the line for an extended period - a \"disruptive\" option that he said was off the table.\n\u201cWe cannot solve all the issues by tearing down and rebuilding our tracks, which will take many years, but at least, in terms of ride experience you can feel the difference with the renewal works,\u201d he said.\nFor the renewal works on the Bukit Panjang LRT, one of the LTA\u2019s main requirements was that it must not require the full shutdown of the line \u2013 a criterion which was met by Bombardier\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cWe had also taken into consideration things like redesigning the viaduct structure. That can only happen with massive disruption, which means you have to shut down a large portion, if not, the whole system,\u201d said Mr Ngien.\n\u201c(Our decision) was analysed as the best move forward, given the need to keep services running while improving the system.\u201d\nMORE RELIABLE TRAIN MOTORS\nThe newer LRT vehicles will have AC motors, which are said to be more reliable than the existing DC ones.\nMajor sub-systems will also be renewed which allows for predictive maintenance.\nOn-site installation works will begin in the second quarter of next year, while all of the new LRT vehicles will enter full service by the end of 2022.\nWorks on the power rail will only be complete by 2024, when the old track circuit system will be decommissioned.\nPrior to the renewal works, the Bukit Panjang LRT line will be closed every Sunday from Apr 15 to Jun 24 this year for additional planned maintenance.\nThirty shuttle buses will be deployed as an alternative travel option.\nThe LTA also announced a new bus service \u2013 Service 974 \u2013 which will ply between Bukit Panjang MRT Station and Joo Koon Bus Interchange via Choa Chu Kang and Jurong West.\nSource: CNA/fr", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ngien hoon ping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noor farhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard hunter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngien hoon pin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bukit panjang lrt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lrt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "land transport authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombardier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombardier transportation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T13:23:48.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bef40c011a7c0e0427236edff69190cb3e1e2759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4fmbrTGI7gY4d9.E_h01dNkqD5cjks67qvVySRO7R8msuenpVtR_ehBkN5fYdBY4MFWOI1LkeeA--", "site_full": "yourstory.com", "site": "yourstory.com", "site_section": "http://yourstory.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Yourstory.com", "title": "\u2018I love being the CEO of my life\u2019", "title_full": "\u2018I love being the CEO of my life\u2019", "published": "2018-03-23T21:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.yourstory.com/2018/03/feature_image1.png", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 3406, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 110, "comments": 0, "shares": 110}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bef40c011a7c0e0427236edff69190cb3e1e2759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4fmbrTGI7gY4d9.E_h01dNkqD5cjks67qvVySRO7R8msuenpVtR_ehBkN5fYdBY4MFWOI1LkeeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sharmila.ail@ys.com (Sharmila Ail)", "published": "2018-03-23T21:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018I love being the CEO of my life\u2019", "text": "Sharmila Ail \nTravel liberated Chayanika Moullick from the Monday blues, setting her off on the #PassiontoPaycheck quest. \nArmed with a Masters degree in English and an advanced diploma in Commercial Art, Chayanika Moullick was doing well for herself in digital marketing and advertising. \nAll that changed in 2013, when she travelled to Singapore, fulfilling her childhood dream of visiting the Jurong Bird Park. Watching the spectacular avian display, it hit her that exploring new places, trying out local cuisines, meeting different people were what made her happy. She was well and truly bitten by the travel bug. \u201cFrom then on, travel became a necessity. Each time I was stressed at work, I would start reading up about a new place and book my next trip.\u201d Early explorations \nSoon, knowing her penchant for travel and as a repository of travel data, friends and colleagues started reaching out to her to plan their weekend getaways. She ended up becoming their go-to person for curating their itineraries. In 2015 she and her friend Tarun (now her husband) started a travel blog, gnawmadic.com . \u201cInitially, he would take care of the photography and I would write. But due to his busy work schedule, he found it difficult to take leave. It was he who taught me the technicalities of using the camera. To brush up my skills in photography, I went on a few photo walks and photo trips to places like Hampi, Varanasi, Kerala, Pondicherry and Ladakh.\u201d Taking the plunge \nAnd so, every month, Chayanika began to travel to new places. But, again, asking for leave was a bother. And so to pursue her passion for travel and photography, she decided to strike out on her own and freelance her design projects. \u201cI quit my full-time job in 2016. It was a huge risk, but I attended a few travel meet-ups, and met a lot of travel writers and digital nomads before making the final move. I realised most of them have no liabilities; they don\u2019t have any rents and loans to pay off. During my nine years of work, I had some savings. Moreover, I had never aspired to climb the corporate ladder. My ambition in life was to travel the world and find a bit of myself with every new place I explored.\u201d Lifestyle changes \nQuitting a good job comes with its fair share of challenges. \u201cI know that I have to fall back on my savings as there is no money coming to my account at the end of the month. Freelance projects are variable and hard to come by. A few lifestyle changes became necessary and I willingly did so. \nToday, I meet friends over coffee instead of drinks. I have swapped my luxury brand of toiletries with an Indian brand. \nI have stopped shopping at malls: instead, I shop online [for bargains]. \nI do not go to ticketed events unless I get a free pass. And I have put the Europe trip on the backburner and am sticking to South Asia only.\u201d \nHer main challenge now is to reach the right audience with her blog stories. She not only wants people to read her blogs but also wants to inspire them to travel and embrace new adventures. And so she continues working on the write-ups and microblogs on Instagram. The freedom \nToday, Chayanika has charted a happy space for herself, personally and professionally. The best part, she says, is that no one can make her feel guilty about having too much fun. \u201cI don\u2019t report to anybody so I am very flexible with my schedule. Some days I design all day and on other days I attend four or five travel or photography events. I do not suffer the dreaded Monday blues anymore. I backpack anytime that suits me.\u201d \nShe believes in the quote, \u2018No plan is the best plan\u2019 \u201cNothing in life is permanent and I may someday go back to designing and park myself on an office chair again. But right now, I love my life of food and travel; I love writing my blogs and absolutely love it when someone addresses me as Gnawmadic. I call myself its Co-Founder and, most of all, I love being the CEO of my life . And for that, I do not need a promotion paper or any kind of official validation.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chayanika moullick", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tarun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sharmila ail  travel", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "jurong bird park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T18:03:39.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a89e619b4b4df11d785e4ab15d196ce3a29b919f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXimOiYDtYzyOLtaCy1IQb8lcKwkfq8cHLC9I7RvB0gft_RGzjQBbFAxMZKYrBsw8vf.DlMXAy8TOfI_S0XE1WhDRZevYEMEkoRRhUhks1_a1prbKkLV8yL8q", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "Latest Singapore news and headlines - Channel NewsAsia", "title": "Election media monitoring body needed to fight fake news by foreign entities: Analyst", "title_full": "Election media monitoring body needed to fight fake news by foreign entities: Analyst - Channel NewsAsia", "published": "2018-03-23T13:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/10070808/16x9/991/529/83a96cdbb79fc750010d2018e92b10f2/YY/dof--institute-of-policy-studies---ips--deputy-director-for-research-dr-gillian-koh.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 6036, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 127, "comments": 0, "shares": 127}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a89e619b4b4df11d785e4ab15d196ce3a29b919f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXimOiYDtYzyOLtaCy1IQb8lcKwkfq8cHLC9I7RvB0gft_RGzjQBbFAxMZKYrBsw8vf.DlMXAy8TOfI_S0XE1WhDRZevYEMEkoRRhUhks1_a1prbKkLV8yL8q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tang See Kit", "published": "2018-03-23T13:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Election media monitoring body needed to fight fake news by foreign entities: Analyst", "text": "  \nSINGAPORE: To combat fake news, a legislation-empowered independent body could be set up to monitor and flag online media content related to elections in Singapore, specifically those designed by foreign actors to influence the country\u2019s politics and policies. \nMaterials created by Singaporeans located outside of the country should also be construed as material generated by foreign sources. \nThis was suggested by Dr Gillian Koh, Institute of Policy Studies\u2019 (IPS) deputy director for research, in her written submission to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods (DOFs). Dr Koh also appeared before the committee at the public hearing on Friday (Mar 23). \nIn her written representation, which she stressed that she was submitting in a personal capacity, Dr Koh mentioned how attempts at exerting foreign influence over Singapore \u201care not new\u201d. \u201cWhat has and can change are the foreign entities that seek to do so, their objectives, methods and the stakes involved.\u201d \nFurther justifications for her suggestion include the fact that elections and national referendums are occasions when all voting-age citizens engage in consequential political decision-making. \u201cThese are important exercises of popular sovereignty and self-determination that must not be undermined either by foreign entities or even by how we design our political institutions and processes.\u201d \nThe availability of Internet-based media also means that communication of any material can spread with much greater ease and speed than before. Advertisement Advertisement \n\u201cWhile the credibility of these materials will vary based on readers\u2019 assessment of who might have created or circulated them, the key point here is that the identities of those who do so can remain anonymous or masked behind pseudonyms. \n\u201cMore critically, it is the design feature of the Internet that there is no single point of control and oversight; that there is no single source of content and no single kill-switch for the system and the material on it,\" said Dr Koh. \nHOW IT WORKS \nDr Koh highlighted several ways in which the Election Media Monitoring Commission could be set up. \nFirstly, it should be empowered through state legislation to monitor any media content that it deems and establishes to be election-related, as well as whether it is generated by foreign entities and individuals, she wrote in her written submission. \nIt will also examine the content for fabricated information or material, and whether it threatens good order and social harmony from the period that a writ of election is issued until the final polling result is declared by the Returning Officer in the case of an election or from the time notice of a referendum is issued till its conclusion. \nSecondly, it should comprise an odd number of former senior judges and professors who have no interest and have never been a member of any political party. Naturalised citizens will also not be allowed on the commission \u201cto avoid any risk of the questioning\u201d of judgement, said Dr Koh. \nMembers will be nominated and then appointed by parliamentarians six months after the start of each parliamentary term with the commission\u2019s monitoring activities taking place during all parliamentary elections, including general elections, by-elections, presidential elections and national referendums. \nThirdly, Dr Koh recommended that the commission be empowered by legislation to tap on all the resources of the state for its monitoring of election-related material. These will include intelligence and cybersecurity agencies of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Defence and IMDA. \nThe commission should be supported by a secretariat from the Elections Department, added Dr Koh. \nUpon its set-up, the commission should create a body of policy to guide its activities. These will include areas such as establishing the circulation threshold for the commission to decide if any material is election-related and has gained traction enough to shape public opinion. Dr Koh suggested for this threshold, which could differ for different types of communications, be reviewed at the start of each new term of the commission. \nWhile the commission should have mechanisms to monitor election-related media, she said it should also have a hotline that allows for the public to share material they think the commission should consider for scrutiny. \nIt should also establish its protocol for tapping a centralised task force for investigations, and how to make known its findings publicly and immediately. \nBy signalling to readers the likelihood of a foreign-sourced material, Singaporean voters can \u201cmake an informed choice\u201d about whether they wish to take the material seriously. The commission will signal with an advisory that further circulation is prohibited with penalties for not abiding by the prohibition. \nThe commission will, however, stop short of suggesting that other penalties be placed upon foreign entities for such material as that may lie outside Singapore\u2019s jurisdiction and in the realm of foreign policy, Dr Koh said. \n\u201cWith the guiding principle that the monitoring system is to ensure that Singapore\u2019s democracy and political institutions are not undermined, these protocols must also be designed and run in ways that uphold the spirit of democracy. \n\u201cThis system is on allowing voters to decide what to read and how seriously to take the material with the best knowledge available at the time on whether it is an attempt at influencing public sentiment by foreign entities, and especially if it is by using fabricated information,\u201d said Dr Koh. \n\u201cTo borrow a phrase, it is important that the cure is not worse than the disease.\u201d \nWHY FOCUS ON ELECTION-RELATED, FOREIGN-GENERATED MATERIALS \nIn her written representation, Dr Koh also explained why she restricted her submission to the spread of deliberate online falsehoods by foreign actors within the context of a parliamentary or presidential election, or a referendum in Singapore. \nFor one, she cited the presence of \u201cstrict rules for the regulation of mass media, both Internet-based and all other platforms\u201d that are designed to \u201cban and block material that can sow discord, threaten internal security in Singapore as well as material that may offend the sensibilities of citizens\u201d. \nThese include the Broadcasting Act, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, the Films Act, the Public Meetings and Entertainment Act and the Undesirable Publications Act. \nBut Dr Koh also stressed the challenge to respond to the threat of DOFs \u201cin a way that does not curb the freedom of expression much further or create an instinct of dependency by citizens on the government\u201d. \n\u201cThe default of Singapore\u2019s governance system must be to encourage the development of informed, discerning citizens, who strive not to give offence or take offence even within the cultural diversity that we find among ourselves.\u201d \nDr Koh also cautioned against recommending a solution that \u201clocks ourselves in a virtual communications prison\u201d or overreacting to the extent that it drives Singapore away from its position as an open and integral node of the global economy and community. \nCommittee member Dr Janil Puthucheary, who is also Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information, questioned the rationale behind Dr Koh\u2019s decision to restrict her suggestion to election periods. He pointed out that foreign actors who want to spread deliberate online falsehoods may not constrain themselves to a specific time. \nDr Koh agreed, acknowledging that there could be issues that require the Government to act outside election periods. However, she explained that her submission was focused on dealing with what she described as a \u201cnew threat\u201d, which is related to \u201cforeign interference during a time when citizens are making consequential political decisions\u201d. \nDuring her oral submission, Dr Koh also referred to points made by others, such as Singapore Management University\u2019s law school dean Goh Yihan , and noted that there could be gaps in the existing legal framework. \nHowever, she maintained that there remains many tools, \u201cwhich seem to be very efficiently mobilised\u201d in dealing with the threat of fake news at the moment. \nMinister of Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam asked about Dr Koh\u2019s suggestion for the commission to put out an advisory to a media content that it deemed to be a falsehood generated by foreign actors, instead of taking it down immediately. He questioned the rationale and purpose in allowing a deliberate online falsehood time to be circulated. \nTo that, Dr Koh said she was echoing a point about balance made by National University of Singapore\u2019s (NUS) law professor Thio Li-ann . \n\u201cIf you take down, it makes it even more attractive to read.

In the Internet age, that\u2019s not entirely foolproof.\u201d \nBy sticking an advisory that prohibits further circulation as the commission confirms whether the material contains falsehood, it will \u201callow for a process of deliberation\u201d. She added that \u201cthere will be citizens that will need to be convinced in their hearts and minds firstly that it is false\u201d and the Government will need to provide this space. \nHowever, she stressed that when it involves an \u201cabsolute, clear data point that is completely false\u201d, there is \u201cno purpose\u201d in allowing it to be circulated. \nLastly, the analyst noted that her considerations undergird the \u201chonest advertising\u201d approach that global Internet and social media companies are proposing. However, Singapore should not rely on these companies, such as Twitter or Facebook, given that it has \u201clittle leverage\u201d over them. \n\u201cWe can only hope that these companies do adopt the strategy due to pressure from their larger markets but we cannot rely on it,\u201d she said.

One look at him and you'll be quick to categorise him into the folk-y, indie singer-songwriter category, but his debut full-length album, Raised Under Grey Skies , will open your ears to more. Released last October, it includes 'September Song', the upbeat, sing-a-long number the world knows him by, as well as soul-filled tracks that betray his gospel roots such as 'All This Love'.Growing up in Manchester in the '90s on a healthy diet of Oasis and Michael Jackson, the 34-year-old would go around record store Vinyl Exchange to discover artists such as Donny Hathaway and Bj\u00f6rk. Although he played in rock bands (one's called Baz Gets Bullied), Cooper also sang in a gospel choir. \nRaised Under Grey Skies features honest-to-goodness autobiographical lyrics, a skilled he honed during his early interest in creative writing. While playing music and writing songs, the self-taught musician also took odd jobs in cafes and bars, and even worked in a Pizza Hut once. Now, he's since collaborated with the likes of Jonas Blue, Stormzy and Craig David, his varied musical style earning him praise. One of his songs, 'Birthday', was even featured in a scene in Fifty Shades Freed . Given his musical beginnings, we ditched a regular interview format and took him to Choice Cuts Goods + Coffee to have him sift through records. Watch the video above for his recommendations. \nSpecial thanks to Choice Cuts Goods + Coffee for location . Check out the cafe and record store at 451 Joo Chiat Rd.
