First time in Davao, if there is any race in the Philippines I would love coming here. It\u2019ll be very difficult for me not to race,\u201d he said.\nMendez, for his part, said that he\u2019s hoping for back-to-back titles in two weeks following his successful stint in Chile, although he too considers it to be a tough competition.\n\u201cI feel great. It\u2019s just amazing to be here, I love the people. I\u2019m super excited for the race. As you see it\u2019s a tough field, I just to do my best,\u201d said the 22-year-old Mendez. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really hard, it\u2019s going to be a really tough race. I\u2019ll do my best to win the event.\u201d\n\u201cI raced in Chile before coming here, which is part of my preparation. I won, so winning back-to-back titles in two weeks would be great. That\u2019s the goal,\u201d added Mendez.\nAlexander, who bagged Ironman world titles in full Ironman in 2008, 2009 and 2011, as well as 70.3 Ironman world championships in 2006 and 2011, thinks that Reed and Mendez, together Australia\u2019s Tim Berkel are the \u2018men to beat\u2019 in this competition.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot\u2026 Tim Berkel, Tim Reed, Mauricio (Mendez),\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of good guys here.\u201d\nAs for his chances, Alexander, who has competed in Subic and Cebu in previous years, said it would be nice if he can have a podium finish considering his seven-month layoff following a bike crash\n\u201cI broke my collarbone and four ribs, but all the indications in training were very good. I trained three months\u2026 I\u2019m lucky to be back. I\u2019m not in my best form but I\u2019m confident I\u2019m going to have a good race,\u201d said Alexander.\nMeanwhile, last year\u2019s Century Tuna Ironman 70.3 Subic titlist Radka Kahlefeldt of the Czech Republic headlines the women\u2019s elite category with Australia\u2019s Dimity Lee Duke and top favorite Anna Eberhardt of Hungary.\n\u201cNot at all (pressure for being top favorite),\u201d said Eberhardt. \u201cActually it\u2019s nice to be ranked number one, I will just try to do my best.\u201d\nOther backers of the event are 2Go Express, Powerade, Wilkins Pure Purified Water, Sportswear, TYR, GU, Aboitiz Power, Davao Light, David\u2019s Salon, Intercare, Davao Metro Shuttle, Prudential Guarantee, HyperHD on Cignal, AsiaTri.com, FinisherPix, TriLife and The Philippine STAR, Alaska, AlcoPlus, ApoAgua, Cetaphil, Daylong, Devant, Fern-C, Penong\u2019s Barbecue Seafood and Grill, Sanicare, Storck, Timex, Seda, Park Inn, Waterfront, Marco Polo and Active Network.\nMore than 1,800 participants from 39 countries are seeing action in the first Ironman in Mindanao, as triathletes will take a 1.9K swim, 90K bike and 21K run to finish the event.\nIronkids 13-14 years old boys and girls division champions Clifford Pusing (L) and Moira Frances Erediano (R).\nMeanwhile, in the Alaska Ironkids, Clifford Pusing and Moira Frances Erediano captured the title in the 13-14 years old boys and girls divisions also at the Azuela Cove here.\nPusing finished the course the with a time of 41 minutes and 24 seconds, besting Adrian Thomas Dionisio (41:48) and Irienold Reig Jr. (41:49), while Erediano had a time of 43:30 as she edged Marielle Estreba (43:31) and Nicole Maria de Rosario (45:36).\nTags: Bellevue Resort Triathlon , Ben Allen , Bradley Weiss , Craig Alexander , Ironman 70.3 , Ironman world winner , Mauricio Mendez , Timothy Reed", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reed", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azuela cove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauricio mendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradley weiss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davao city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cebu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T08:50:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0f341b0d38f32de92e6eeb179079c12f323abcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXe_FwmsTkrzzzFX7JG9Bt.2uJri3Lmgmk96ZK0WdyBJXdgkDfuX9xbhLcDWxF6NK5nfiVJTYKUJiYBtBX6WwzVywxN6L8Kg3c0_P7uGNtrJQ--", "site_full": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "site": "inquirer.net", "site_section": "http://newsinfo.inquirer.net", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Inquirer News | INQUIRER.net -

The 22-year-old Mendez rallied in the closing stage of the 1.9K swim, 90K bike, 21K run event to beat three-time Philippine Ironman 70.3 champion Tim Reed and Tim Van Berkel. \u201cThat was a hard battle,\u201d said Mendez, the reigning Xterra world champion. \u201cI was in second place until the final 13 kilometers. The effort was just too hard.\u201d From fifth in the opening swim part, Mendez worked his way up in the bike stage then outlasted his veteran rivals in the grueling run event to nail his first Ironman 70.3 victory in 3:50:32. Reed clocked 3:52:26 to finish second while Van Berkel came in third in 3:53:45 followed by five-time world champion Craig Alexander, also of Australia (3:56:24) and Bradley Weiss of South Africa (3:58:37). But while Mendez needed to unleash a strong finishing kick to snare the crown, Kahlefeldt dominated the women\u2019s pro side and completed a wire-to-wire triumph in 4:25:38. She came out on top in the swim leg then sustained her charge in the bike and run, posting a more than 11-minute victory for her sixth career championship. Japanese Naomi Washizu took runner-up honors in 4:36:53 while many-time Philippine triathlon champion Dimity Lee Duke settled for third in 4:39:12. Lisa Tyack, also from Australia, clocked 4:41:01 and placed fourth in her first pro race while Kirralee Seidel, also from Down Under, timed 4:53:04 for fifth in the event held in Mindanao for the first time in a decade of triathlon staging by Sunrise Events, Inc. Mendez still trailed Reed in the early part of the run stage but grabbed the lead in the last seven kms and stayed ahead all the way to the finish. \u201cWhen I passed him, I never looked back,\u201d said Mendez. Reed rued dropping his bottle of power drink off his bike in one of the humps and opted not to stop to get it back in fear of losing precious time. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to stop,\u201d said Reed who also thanked countryman Berkel for sparing a couple of (power) gels. Rounding out the top 10 of the elite pros were South Africa's Bradley Weiss (3:58:37) and Kyle Buckingham (4:01:43), Australians Sam Betten (4:03:36), Eric Watson (4:13:59) and Ben Allen (4:18:08) and Canada's Brent McMahon (4:20:38). Jorry Ycong emerged as the top Filipino finisher in the race that generated so much interest and a monstrous traffic in and around the city on race day. He locked 4:24:15, followed in the Filipino elite category by August Benedicto (4:25:02), Banjo Norte (4:25:07), Jumalil Paul (4:36:24) and Benjamin Rana (4:40:42).

Jeeves de Veyra MANILA -- Besides celebrating World Macaron Day on Saturday by giving away free macarons to their customers, Bizu Patisserie also launched four new macaron flavors for the summer.\nThis French confection has garnered a following in the Philippines, thanks in large part to Bizu, which helped popularize macarons in the early 2000s. Whether eating them with tea or coffee, or on their own, these melt-in-your-mouth treats are always a delight, especially now that they come in local flavors.\nThe Malagos Chocolate macaron uses 65% dark chocolate from Davao, creating a great interplay of sweet and slightly bitter -- ideal for those that like it not too sweet.\nWith local cheese and white chocolate ganache sandwiching yellow almond meringue discs, the Queso Macaron has a very light cheese flavor.\nThe Ube Macaron, meanwhile, has purple and white discs, and a dark violet Bohol yam infused buttercream filling. Ube is the world\u2019s flavor de jour of the moment, and Bizu\u2019s macaron is unapologetically ube\u2014a great representation of our favorite local yam.\nLast but not the least, fans of Davao\u2019s pungent fruit will love the Durian Macaron. With durian-infused buttercream, one can tell Bizu didn\u2019t scrimp on the flavor with just a whiff.\nThese summer macarons will only be available until April 31.\n ", "highlightText": "",
