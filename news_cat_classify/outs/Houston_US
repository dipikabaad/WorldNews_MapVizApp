According to the indictment , Bennett allegedly injured a a 66-year-old paraplegic, who was working security at NRG Stadium. \nBennett was at the game to watch his brother, Martellus, who was playing tight end for New England. After the Patriots beat the Falcons 34-28, Michael was trying to get down to the field when the incident happened. According to the indictment, Michael was trying to shove his way on to the field when security personnel informed him that he would have to take another entrance. Apparently, Michael didn't listen to their request and he decided to push through security at the field entrance he wasn't supposed to be using. \nDuring the pushing, a 66-year-old disabled female was injured. The indictment for the case came down on Friday from a Harrison County (Texas) jury. The punishment for the charge carries up to ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \nPolice in Harris County have issued a warrant for Bennett's arrest. According to prosecutors in Harris County, authorities are working with Bennett's team in regards to his surrender. The indictment comes less than three weeks after the defensive end was traded from the Seahawks to the Eagles. \nThe incident in Houston was one of two times that Bennett had a brush with the law in 2017. The 32-year-old was also involved in an incident in Las Vegas in August. During that incident, Bennett claimed he was racially profiled by members of the Las Vegas Police Department following a skirmish at a nightclub after the Mayweather-MacGregor fight.

Bennett was told to use a different field entrance, but he pushed through the security detail, which included a 66-year-old paraplegic woman in a wheelchair, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference. The woman suffered a sprained shoulder in the February 5, 2017, incident, Acevedo said. Seahawks' Michael Bennett: Trump stooped so low with his NFL attacks \"It's offensive to me that a man who's supposed to be an example, a professional athlete, thinks its OK to act like this,\" Acevedo said. Read More Bennett's legal team does not have a comment at this time, Frank Perez, a member of the team, said Friday night. CNN reached out to Bennett for comment through his representative Doug Hendrickson but has not heard back. Harris County said the felony charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Bennett was one of the most vocal NFL players in protesting the national anthem before games. He appeared on CNN and said he didn't understand why President Donald Trump would \"stoop so low\" as to say that NFL owners should fire players who protest. Bennett, 32, played with the Seattle Seahawks for five seasons and just signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played high school football in Houston and college ball at Texas A&M University. Acevedo said Bennett's lawyer has been notified. The chief said Bennett has not been arrested yet but should turn himself into police as soon as possible. When asked why it took more than a year to file charges against Bennett, Acevedo said police had to prioritize more serious crimes. Also, Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August, he noted. Acevedo said an officer at the game witnessed Bennett pushing the woman but decided to check on the elderly woman rather than immediately arrest Bennett, whom he recognized. \"We knew who the suspect was,\" Acevedo said. \"We knew what he had done and we knew where to find him.\" The Philadelphia Eagles said in a statement Friday: \"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\" Last September, Bennett complained that police in Las Vegas unfairly singled him out, threatened him with a gun and detained him briefly after he attended a prizefight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor. Las Vegas authorities said officers were responding to a call of battery and assault with a gun that had turned into an active shooter situation and thought that Bennett might be involved.

Mr. Washington said he still wonders if race had something to do with the attack. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Ora Houston, an African-American councilwoman here, stood as a proclamation was read inside City Hall on Thursday.\nIt had nothing to do with the Austin serial bomber, Mark Conditt. It had to do with a deeper, older and far more invisible hurt \u2014 the 90th anniversary of a 1928 city plan that created a \u201cNegro district\u201d on the east side of town.\n\u201cThe Negro district was intentionally created by the Austin City Council to force Negros and Mexicans who lived in other parts of Austin to move to the Negro district,\u201d Mayor Steve Adler said as Ms. Houston, a longtime East Austin resident, looked on at his side. \u201cAnd the effects are apparent in the racial and economic disparities found in East Austin today.\u201d\nThree of the five bombs that terrorized Central Texas this month went off in East Austin, where the majority of the city\u2019s black and Hispanic residents live, prompting the police to investigate them as possible hate crimes. When the fourth bomb was planted in an upscale gated and largely white community west of Interstate 35, the issue of race disappeared from most official statements \u2014 a fact that has stirred deep resentment among many black residents. The only two people killed, many have been quick to point out, came from two of the city\u2019s most prominent black families.\n The debate over how to characterize the bomber\u2019s nearly three-week campaign of violence has been a reminder, for many, of the ways in which race, geography and class continue to play out in a city that prides itself on tolerance and diversity.\n Though Austin is widely seen as a liberal island in a deeply conservative state, the attacks have stoked the raw racial, economic, political and geographical divisions that continue to shape life here, 90 years after the city was segregated by decree. Austin and its suburbs remain sharply divided by class, race and even religion. Like Houston, it is an urban, diverse and Democratic hub surrounded by largely white, Republican suburbs, including Pflugerville, Mr. Conditt\u2019s hometown.\n\u201cAustin has gradually started to become aware and conversant about its race issues over the past five years, so the initial suggestion that these bombings could be race-related made people deeply nervous that the problem could be that bad,\u201d said Cecilia Ball\u00ed, a writer and cultural anthropologist who lived in Austin from 2008 to 2014 and who now lives in Houston. \u201cWhether or not the bomber\u2019s motive ends up being race, this brought to the forefront one of the city\u2019s challenges and worst fears.\u201d\nThe police have said that Mr. Conditt, who is white, gave no indication in a 25-minute confession left on his phone that he was driven by racial hatred. News emerged Thursday that one of the explosive packages he sent at a FedEx store was addressed to a spa employee who is white. His past statements, including the views he expressed on a community college blog opposed to gay marriage, have added to speculation that he was anti-gay.\nIn East Austin on Thursday, Daniel Arriaga, 51, a furniture mover, said he still believed the bomber had a hatred for blacks and Hispanics. He had harmed the two white victims, Mr. Arriaga theorized, \u201cjust to throw it off.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In his hometown Pflugerville, about 20 miles northeast of Austin, the mayor, Victor Gonzales, is Hispanic. One of the candidates who ran against him was Philip Emiabata, who was born in Nigeria. One of Mr. Conditt\u2019s roommates was black. And one of his friends was Sierra Davis, a transgender woman and Marine veteran who is part Hispanic.\n \u201cHonestly, Mark was a lot like I was,\u201d said Ms. Davis, 23, who got to know Mr. Conditt when they were teenagers. \u201cHe was a home schooler, Christian, and I was the same. I mean, we were all awkward at the time. Growing up, Pflugerville had a small-town feel to it. It was a lot more conservative than Austin, a lot more home-school friendly.\u201d\nMs. Davis said that Mr. Conditt told her she was \u201cgoing to hell\u201d when she was transitioning. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t surprised by what he said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were raised like that and I was tied to those beliefs, too.\u201d\nIn Austin, I-35 has long been recognized as the dividing line separating most of the city\u2019s minority residents from its white population, and much of its have-nots from the haves. That dividing line has an ugly, decades-old history. In an online examination of the city\u2019s racial and economic divide by The Austin American-Statesman, a real estate ad circa 1915 reads: \u201cHyde Park is exclusively for white people.\u201d\nJesse E. Washington, 68, a retired city inspector who is black and was born and raised in Austin, lives in a small ranch house his parents built in the 1960s in East Austin. He graduated from a segregated high school in 1967.\n\u201cIf you wanted to buy a home and own property in Austin, you could only get your utilities turned on if you were in East Austin,\u201d Mr. Washington said.\nNow, of course, East Austin is far different.\n\u201cIf you walk up and down here you see the white kids walking their dogs and riding bicycles,\u201d he said. Many of his black neighbors, he said, \u201chave sold off.\u201d\nPhoto A mural in East Austin depicting influential African-American and Latino icons. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Mr. Washington lives next door to the scene of one of the explosions, the one that killed Draylen Mason, 17, an African-American classical musician whose grandfather was a well-known dentist. The blast woke Mr. Washington around 6:45 a.m. that morning. At first he thought it was a falling tree limb.\nMr. Washington listened with interest to the police chief\u2019s description of Mr. Conditt\u2019s confession. But he said he still wonders if race had something to do with it.\n \u201cYou know, the possibilities are endless,\u201d he said. \u201cThese mental conditions that are in our minds growing up, the influences people have from the older generations.\u201d\nBlack leaders and residents have accused the police of failing to take the first bombing seriously because the victim was black, an accusation that police officials have denied. At the time of the first bombing on March 2, the authorities believed it was in retaliation for a drug raid the police had conducted on a similar-looking house on the same street three days beforehand.\n\u201cWe had a pretty strong working theory that day that led us to believe it was an isolated incident that day,\u201d the Austin police chief, Brian Manley, told reporters recently. \u201cIt was very unique. We had no information to believe it was related to a larger plan at that time.\u201d\nThe bombings have come at a critical time for the city\u2019s black population. A 2014 University of Texas report highlighted the drastic decline in the number of black residents in Austin, even as the city has boomed. Austin\u2019s overall population growth rate was more than 20 percent between 2000 and 2010, making it the third-fastest growing city in the country. But the number of African-American residents declined by 5.4 percent \u2014 making it the only one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the United States to experience a loss in black population.\nIt was the result, the researchers wrote, of \u201cpersistent structural inequalities.\u201d The emerging tech industry was not hiring black and Latino residents. People of color were losing trust in the public schools on the traditionally black east side.\nMs. Houston, the city councilwoman, said she now occasionally feels unwelcome in restaurants in the east side neighborhoods where she grew up, and which are becoming whiter.\n\u201cAs a black female they look at me like, \u2018Why is she here?\u2019\u201d she said.\nRace has played out here in the backdrop of the case in other ways. KVUE, an ABC-affiliated TV station in Austin, issued an apology, after the words \u201cthis monkey\u201d appeared in a sentence about Mr. Mason during its breaking-news coverage of the bombings. KVUE\u2019s closed-captioning provider, VITAC, issued its own apology and said the error was \u201cnot intentional.\u201d\nKVUE said it had severed ties with VITAC \u201cdue to the terrible mistake.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "austin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cecilia ball\u00ed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conditt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pflugerville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:29:36.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fda2316b161be013a03af6a26b17cd12ce0f6c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2M8sQoApIexdQjkZVzVOvBnUc7kNatISLT1riKV0CQieVDuvuPUbCwx0FzNij0PBPHGvD1RtBW_O8f5b6hkq8cdg--", "site_full": "www.cosmopolitan.com", "site": "cosmopolitan.com", "site_section": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/contenttype/news/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News ", "title": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "title_full": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "published": "2018-03-24T12:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-03-24-at-9-10-23-am-1521907847.png?crop=1.00xw:0.862xh;0,0.0386xh&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1970, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2765, "comments": 0, "shares": 2765}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fda2316b161be013a03af6a26b17cd12ce0f6c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2M8sQoApIexdQjkZVzVOvBnUc7kNatISLT1riKV0CQieVDuvuPUbCwx0FzNij0PBPHGvD1RtBW_O8f5b6hkq8cdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cosmopolitan.com", "published": "2018-03-24T12:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "text": "A Wisconsin man who tried to sell his 4-year-old daughter for sex was sentenced to 60 years in prison.\nKHOU reports that Andrew Turley, 30, was convicted for trafficking of a child and compelling prostitution of someone under the age of 18.\nIn 2015, Turley placed a Craigslist ad with the title, \"Play with Daddie's Little Girl.\" According to the district attorney's office, in subsequent emails with undercover police officers, Turley wrote that he had a girl who was \"younger than 10\" and he would give her \"sleep meds\" before the encounter.

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett has been indicted for a felony charge of injury of the elderly in Houston\u2019s Harris County, and a warrant is out for his arrest. Bennett allegedly injured a 66-year-old paraplegic who was working at NRG Stadium during Super Bowl LI. The employee was controlling access to the field for the game. The incident allegedly happened after the game, when the Patriots had completed their comeback and won the Super Bowl. Bennett \u2019s brother, Martellus, was a tight end for the Patriots in the game. From the Harris County office of the district attorney : Immediately following the game, Bennett shoved his way on to the field where players were gathering to celebrate. NRG Security personnel, including the 66-year-old disabled victim, told Bennett he had to use a different entrance for field access. Instead, he pushed through them, including the elderly woman who was part of the security team. The charge, injury to the elderly, includes intentionally and knowingly, causing bodily injury to a person 65 years or older. According to the Harris County release, prosecutors are working with Bennett\u2019s counsel regarding his surrender.

McMaster's Choice - The Atlantic", "text": "By Eliot A. Cohen The Atlantic Read bio March 24, 2018 Before he was the national-security adviser, he wrote a lacerating account of generals who failed in advising Lyndon Johnson. What will he say now that he is free to talk about Trump? \n\u201cThey have their exits and their entrances,\u201d wrote Shakespeare, and so it is, as we see some actors deliver frantic speeches while others leap, slide, or crawl on and off the foreign-policy stage. \nRex Tillerson said farewell to the Department of State much as he entered it: clueless about government service, clueless about his department, and clueless about his boss. He invoked the clich\u00e9 of Washington as a \u201cmean-spirited town\u201d\u2014as though executive suites in Houston were foreign to nastiness, and as though the capital were demonstrably short of the amiability that characterizes Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, or Las Vegas. He could not accept the true diagnosis of his failure: that he had chosen to work for an immoral egomaniac who predictably treats his subordinates\u2014and treated him\u2014as shabbily as he has betrayed his wives and allegedly attempted to buy his sex partners. \nAt almost the same moment that Tillerson was delivering his meagerly attended soliloquy, National-Security Adviser H. R. McMaster was similarly given the boot. The world was notified by tweet of his dismissal, but the exchange of compliments between the general and the commander in chief was more civil. Like Tillerson, McMaster had been surprised by his initial job offer; like Tillerson he never established a rapport with the president; like Tillerson he suffered repeated humiliations and put-downs from a boss who shared neither his decency nor his regard for public service. But Trump was a bit more gentle in this case: perhaps because he has a sneaking affection for generals, who are, in his parlance, \u201ckillers.\u201d He may also have reflected that in addition to a moralistic streak, McMaster has a temper and a gift for effective writing. \nTillerson and McMaster were good men who answered an unexpected call to serve. Their motives to do so probably included some admixture of ambition or vanity as well as patriotism. They themselves may not know the proportions of such motivations, human nature being the complex compound of pure and impure impulses that it is. They are being replaced by considerably more canny and political figures, Michael Pompeo and John Bolton, whose policy instincts are more in tune with Trump\u2019s tough-guy swagger, but more importantly who are much more skilled at manipulating the president. Neither McMaster nor Tillerson were cynics, and both were Washington outsiders. To find their successors, the president has turned to a corner of the very swamp he had once promised to drain. A former congressmen and a long time in-and-outer are, after all, creatures from the reeking fens, even if they hail from a distinctively boggy corner of the Washington wetlands. Subscribe   \nThe mix of personalities in high office matters more than ideology, particularly with a president so ignorant and unrooted as this one. Bolton; Pompeo; a weakened and not overly principled chief of staff, John Kelly; and an obsequious vice president, Mike Pence, will collectively tend to facilitate Trump\u2019s more pugnacious foreign-policy inclinations. They will attract a darker, angrier, and more aggressive set of subordinates, together with a larger number of opportunists, and in both categories, mediocrities. Who else, after all, would choose to serve in an administration so chaotic, so badly managed, so besieged with special counsels, weekly sex and expense-account scandals, trade wars, disdainful allies, impending electoral debacles, simmering conflicts with a variety of foreign powers, and, on top of it all, indictments and possibly even impeachment looming in the years ahead? Ultimately, they will probably clash with the one remaining foreign- and security-policy outsider, who is also the administration\u2019s most important moderate, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. The new team makes dangerous policymaking even more likely in an already fraught world. \nTillerson will probably retreat to Texas and lick his wounds. He may or may not write a memoir: He does not need the money, and although there are ghost writers aplenty to assist him should he choose to do so, his discomfort with the written word would make for a clunky tale. If he writes a memoir it will probably be an attempt to retell and justify his brief, unhappy time as the country\u2019s chief diplomat rather than to indict the administration. \nMcMaster is a different case, whose choices will be more consequential. He will retire from the Army, a course he would have been well-advised to take before taking office. He is not wealthy; he has strong convictions at odds with those of Trump; he is known for his forceful views of right and wrong; he probably would rather have been a four star. And above all, he has already written one powerful book, and now has the opportunity to write another. \nDereliction of Duty, McMaster\u2019s revised Ph.D. thesis on the Vietnam War, made his literary name, presenting as it did a powerful and well-researched case that the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the mid-1960s failed candidly to present and argue their position to President Lyndon Johnson. It is a good book, although it should be noted that LBJ fully understood that the JCS wanted to do more in Vietnam and faster, but chose not to take that course for a number of reasons. Furthermore it is far from clear that the Chiefs\u2019 preferred approach would have made a useful strategic difference. Indeed, it might well have precipitated a clash with China not all that dissimilar from that of the Korean War. No matter: Dereliction of Duty deservedly made a splash when it came out in 1996. \nThe book was a successful young combat veteran\u2019s expression of righteous anger against superiors of an earlier generation whom he thought had failed to speak truth to power. It became the middle-aged general\u2019s hundred-pound rucksack when, much to his surprise, he was plucked by Donald Trump from imminent retirement to become national-security adviser. It became an implicit measuring rod against which any public official would probably fall short. And when McMaster began publicly to praise the president, to echo his dystopian view of international politics, to cover for his reckless compromises of intelligence material, there was no shortage of commentators keen to pounce. \n]McMaster now has a choice. He can simply remain silent about his time in government and his views of the Trump administration\u2019s methods and policies\u2014highly unlikely given his nature and the financial incentives to speak out. He may, alternatively, choose to make only restrained criticisms in a careful memoir; or he may, in accordance with both his character and temperament, write a volcanic account, perhaps angry and self-justifying, but insightful, blunt, cathartic and even, in some way, redeeming. \nThe national-security adviser had to, or in some cases chose to, say things that his inner nature must have abhorred. As a scholar trained by one of the best military historians in the country, for example, McMaster knows just how rancid a slogan America First is, what dangerous and even vile policy sentiments of 1940 and 1941 it reflected. It will be a hard memoir to write if he confronts that and other facts. Whether he chooses to do so will say something about him, of course, but something too about the readiness of decent and prominent men and women who have served or justified this administration to face the truth. From start to finish, the question about Trump and those who have served, supported, or opposed him has come down to character. McMaster\u2019s memoir, should he write one, will, in many ways illuminate the battering to individual integrity the president has caused. It may also indicate whether the cuts can heal, leaving scars, as one hopes, rather than suppurating wounds. Eliot A.

Michael Ainsworth / AP Email \nHOUSTON -- A grand jury has indicted Philadelphia Eagles player Michael Bennett for allegedly injuring a 66-year-old paraplegic woman when he tried to get onto the field at last year's Super Bowl to celebrate with his brother, Martellus Bennett. Michael Bennett, a three-time Pro Bowl defensive end, was indicted on one felony count of injury to the elderly, the Harris County District Attorney's Office announced Friday. \nThe charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \nAuthorities said Bennett, 32, was a spectator at the game in Houston when he tried to get onto the field immediately after the game to see his brother, a tight end for the Patriots at the time. Prosecutors said he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field. Medical records show that the woman suffered a sprained shoulder, police said. \nCBS affiliate KHOU reports that the injured worker has been with security management Contemporary Services since 2013. The company said she's an \"excellent\" employee\" and they are \"proud to have her.\" \nA warrant has been issued for Bennett's arrest, and prosecutors are working with his lawyers to plan his surrender. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles released the following statement on the alleged incident: \n\"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\" \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

He was the flight commander charged with landing on the moon. After an oxygen tank exploded, Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise had to call off their mission and figure out how to get back to Earth.\nTwenty-five years later, actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in a Hollywood film about their epic journey.\nApollo 13 astronauts Fred Haise, James Lovell, and John Swigert (left to right) leave a helicopter to step aboard the carrier Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean after their successful recovery. | AP\nWe\u2019d like to give this American hero, who lives in a north suburb of Chicago, a shout-out as he turns 90 Sunday. Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium is celebrating Lovell\u2019s achievements in a yearlong campaign , encouraging space fans to write Lovell notes to let him know what kind of impact his space travels had on them.\nEDITORIAL\nLovell\u2019s name is synonymous with Apollo 13, but we\u2019ll never forget his Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It was the first manned flight to break from the Earth\u2019s orbit and travel around the moon.\nRELATED: Lovell spoke to Sun-Times reporter Robert Herguth about his faith in a podcast last year.\nWe asked author Robert Kurson, whose book \u201cRocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man\u2019s First Journey to the Moon\u201d will be out next month, to give a few good reasons to celebrate Lovell today. Here\u2019s his excellent list:\nJim Lovell donated many of his coolest space-related memorabilia and artifacts to the Adler Planetarium, giving Chicagoans and other visitors an intimate glimpse into the early years of space travel and exploration. He is a wonderful explainer and storyteller who often makes himself available to media and others who are interested in NASA, space, the Moon, and the future of space travel. He is a devoted husband, father and family man who has been married to the same woman, Marilyn, for 65 years. (Astronaut life was notoriously hard on marriages. In fact, the crew of Apollo 8 \u2014 Frank Borman, Lovell, and Bill Anders \u2014 is the only crew from either the Gemini or Apollo programs whose marriages all survived intact.) He is not just one of the nicest astronauts you\u2019ll meet, he\u2019s one of the nicest people you\u2019ll meet, a reputation that goes back to his earliest days with NASA. Unlike some astronauts, he dreamed as a kid of flying on rockets into space and exploring the cosmos, and he seems to have lost little of that boyhood wonder for exploration to this day. He had a golden retriever that liked to watch the Apollo 13 movie when it played on television at his home. Happy Birthday, Commander James Lovell. You continue to make Chicago proud.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james lovell", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lovell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack swigert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom hanks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john swigert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred haise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adler planetarium", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iwo jima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:00:49.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 2612, "moreResultsAvailable": 2602, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745515969&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AUS+location%3AHouston&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 949, "extra": {"place": "Houston", "country": "US", "lat": "29.7604267", "lng": "-95.3698028"}}
