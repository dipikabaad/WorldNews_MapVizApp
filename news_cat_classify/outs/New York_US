Image courtesy of Shabazz Stuart \nOonee\u2019s bike pods, which provide a secure, enclosed spot where anywhere from 10-43 cyclists can lock up, function like conventional bike cages. But they\u2019re also designed to meet the aesthetic and activational needs of a particular urban space, with the goal of attracting further amenities (think food trucks and bike-share stations) that would in turn attract more people. Theoretically, they could even inspire more people to start riding. \n\u201cWe wanted to make something that would make people who don\u2019t own a bike want to go out and get a bike,\u201d says Mansylla, Oonee\u2019s co-founder and creative director. \nRELATED: This Dutch City Opened the World\u2019s Biggest Bike-Parking Garage \nMansylla previously made a name for himself designing parklets , or mini-parks in former vehicle parking spaces, in New York. He hopes to approach bike pods the same way\u2014that is, using easy-to-assemble kitted parts that build into a sophisticated design, much like Ikea or Lego products. This helps appeal to budget-minded transportation departments, but it also allows the pods scale and adapt to different streets or cities. \n\u201cThe sidewalk is populated with stuff that is stuck and old, like phone booths or newsstands,\u201d Mansylla says. \u201cWe wanted something that was ever-changing.\u201d Examples of bike pod designs Image courtesy of Shabazz Stuart \nOonee\u2019s first bike pods are slated to appear in early April at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York. Stuart says he aims to build five to 10 prototypes this year, and that he\u2019s close to making a deal on a second space in Manhattan. The pair is also in talks with officials in San Francisco and New Orleans. \nThis will be Oonee\u2019s chance to prove itself to cities, institutions, potential sponsors, and ordinary cyclists. For now, interested riders can sign up for the pilot to gain access to the pod. Monthly memberships will cost \u201c$10 or lower\u201d according to Stuart. In the future, he says, he wants to integrate an app so users can register for a pod or pay on demand, with each pod knowing your bike\u2019s location at all times. \nRELATED: The World\u2019s Coolest Bike Infrastructure \nEventually, Stuart wants to see the pods turn into service centers where cyclists can have their bikes tuned up or repaired as they go about their day. A cyclist himself\u2014he\u2019s had three bikes stolen in five years\u2014Stuart says he\u2019ll rely on feedback about what riders want out of a new, improved way to lock up their bikes. \n\u201cWe need to be engaging everyone at once,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is very much community-driven infrastructure.\u201d A bike pod under construction.
