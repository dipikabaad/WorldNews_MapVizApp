The prime minister made the statement at the end of an EU summit in Brussels which debated a common strategy over the incident. Download: MP3 \nAndrej Babi\u0161, photo: CTK European Union leaders backed Britain on Thursday in blaming Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former double agent in Britain agreeing to recall the EU envoy to Moscow and opening the door to additional retaliatory steps by some member states. One of the member states likely to take further action is the Czech Republic. Speaking shortly after the summit ended, Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 said Prague would seriously consider expelling a number of Russian diplomats over the incident. \n\u201cWe are seriously considering this course of action and I will discuss the matter on Monday with Foreign Minister Stropnick\u00fd and other members of the cabinet. We are likely to head in this direction.\u201d \nThe prime minister said the number of expelled diplomats would be in the single digits, not dozens and would not include the ambassador. \nThe Czech Republic was directly drawn into the dispute after the Russian Foreign Ministry rejected responsibility for the attack, saying the nerve agent Novichok could easily have come from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, or Great Britain itself. Speaking at NATO headquarters earlier, Mr. Babi\u0161 resolutely rejected the idea calling it as a blatant lie. Czech Foreign Minister Martin Stropnick\u00fd earlier summoned the Russian ambassador to explain the accusation. \nAlthough Prague was among the first to condemn the poisoning and express solidarity with Britain over the incident, the prime minister\u2019s statement that the country would most likely expel a number of diplomats came as a surprise, since earlier both the prime minister and foreign minister had stressed the need for coordinated EU action in this respect. To what extent the Czech prime minister\u2019s one-on-one meeting with his British counterpart Theresa May on the sidelines of the summit may have influenced this decision is not clear. \nRussian diplomats leave Russian Embassy in London, March 20, 2018, photo: CTK In any case, centre-right parties in Prague have strongly supported such a move, saying it was long overdue and stressing that Prague does not need to wait for the big players to come to a decision on this matter. The Communist Party, on the other hand, sees the move as premature and opposition is also likely to come from the country\u2019s president who is widely seen as pro-Russian. \nThe Russian representation in Prague is unusually large, with some 48 diplomats in residence. The Czech intelligence service has in recent years issued warnings regarding heightened activities on the part of Russian and Chinese agents in the country, and political scientists say there is no doubt that Prague has become a hub for Russian activities in broader Central Europe.

The star of films such as Belle de Jour, The Last Metro, and Indochina, arrived in Prague for the close of the festival. Download: MP3 \nCatherine Deneuve, photo: CTK Catherine Deneuve is nothing less than a legend, having worked together with directors like Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Dem\u00fd and many others. In Prague for the close of Febio Fest, she spoke candidly about her career: what it had been like to work with Gerard Depardieu, who she called very generous as an actor. On the same topic she said she had been a little nervous before the first time she had worked with her daughter Chiara Mastroianni but that that had quickly changed. \n\u201cWhen I worked with my daughter Chiara I thought it would be a little strange at the beginning, you know, it would be someone you know and suddenly you would have to say things to each other from a script. I thought it would be strange. \n\u201cBut finally, it wasn\u2019t at all. We would go to the make-up room, and everything was very natural. I did another film with here recently that hasn\u2019t been released yet directed by Julie Bertucelli, but the whole thing was much more casual than I thought.\u201d \nReceiving a lifetime achievement award like the Kristi\u00e1n for contribution to cinematography is always an invitation, to a degree, for actors to look back on their career. One journalist present suggested the actress, who is 74, could write her memoirs, speculating on all the stories she could tell. But the actress made clear she had no intention of doing any such thing. Deneuve also made clear she was not nostalgic for the 1960s and 1970s when she first achieved fame. Catherine Deneuve again: \n\u201cMaybe I enjoy [making films] today more today than I did 40 years ago because I know more about filming and being part of the whole troupe, being part of the crew; because I have friends who write screenplays and who are directors or are technicians. I know more about filmmaking and the process so I also more patient. I wouldn\u2019t say I was happier on set 40 years ago, no.\u201d \nCatherine Deneuve, photo: CTK She was also asked if she had the chance, would she do it all over again. \n\u201cAh, if I had a second chance would I decide to be an actress? Well, being an actress happened to me.\u201d \nShe explained that she was just 17 when she got into acting because of her sister and that one film led to another. She acknowledged there were professions she certainly enjoyed \u2013 such as architecture or archaeology \u2013 but said she was unsure she would have been aware of it at that age.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "catherine deneuve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis bunuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiara mastroianni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francois truffaut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristian award", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard depardieu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacques dem\u00fd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "febio fest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "febio fest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indochina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T16:58:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6c09fd9690a954622575bb6c499c0251431c46f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hzqEh69FLtTXxYKuyRCZWUREb_Ww9wNUnjASsrt0PR8AGiRG_xDeiDwv96ld2E_sP7oygVwhPaqyzvd4v7pYz", "site_full": "www.radio.cz", "site": "radio.cz", "site_section": "http://radio.cz/feeds/rss/en/en.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Radio Prague - Latest articles", "title": "Thalia Awards handed out in Prague", "title_full": "Thalia Awards handed out in Prague", "published": "2018-03-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6c09fd9690a954622575bb6c499c0251431c46f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hzqEh69FLtTXxYKuyRCZWUREb_Ww9wNUnjASsrt0PR8AGiRG_xDeiDwv96ld2E_sP7oygVwhPaqyzvd4v7pYz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Thalia Awards handed out in Prague", "text": "Subscribe to RSS \nThe Czech Actors' Association presented the prestigious annual Thalia Awards at Prague\u2019s National Theatre on Saturday night.
