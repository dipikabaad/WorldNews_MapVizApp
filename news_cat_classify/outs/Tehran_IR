\u2013 Hezbollah\u2019s Secretary General, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, announced his party\u2019s electoral program for the upcoming legislative polls, in a televised speech on Wednesday. \nAcorrding to MNA, \u201cThis electoral platform is not a political document, yet it focuses on an array of headlines that Hezbollah seeks to achieve through its presence in the Parliament,\u201d Nasrallah said, \n\u201cThe legislative polls constitute a serious opportunity for the Lebanese people to reproduce their national authorities,\u201d he added, heaping praise on the army-people-resistance formula. \n\u201cWe lead these polls in order to remain the true voice expressing the aspirations of the people, and in defense of our nation against the Israeli and Takfiri enemies,\u201d he stressed. \nNasrallah continued: \u201cWe shall work, from our parliamentary position, on: \n-protecting Lebanon and its people, territories, oil, and natural resources -achieving political and administrative reform inside the state institutions -improving the current vote mode -developing the judicial system and enhancing it as an independent authority -bolstering the role of the monitoring bodies -establishing a national ministry for planning -drawing special attention to the combat of financial and administrative corruption -providing the necessary capacities to beef up the security and military institutions, on top of which the Lebanese army -endorsing the extended administrative decentralization law in Lebanon -adopting the process of bids and tenders -reinforcing the role of the civil service board and rendering it a sole entrance to public employment -activating computerization to facilitate citizens\u2019 formalities.\u201d \n\u201cOur platform includes developing the electoral law, especially pertaining to turning Lebanon into a single district and lowering the vote age to 18.\u201d \n\u201cWe have decided, in Hezbollah, to form a special organizational frame whose task is to face waste and corruption,\u201d he revealed. \n\u201cWe are committed to keeping our organization and our party clean and uninvolved in any sort of corruption or waste,\u201d he underlined, inviting \u201cwhoever owns any given or has any doubt about any likely involvement of any Hezbollah official in corruption\u201d to provide evidence on such implication.\u201d \n\u201cI will personally follow up on the issue of fighting corruption, because we are entering a dangerous period,\u201d he stressed. \nTouching on the economic and financial policies, the Hezbollah leader highlighted the obligation to control and rationalize public spending in compliance with people\u2019s basic needs, resolve the waste and electricity crises, devise development plans for all regions and provide comprehensive healthcare insurance for all citizens. \nHe also tackled the necessity to boost the capacities of the governmental hospitals and work on reducing the medical bill, promote the level of public education and enhance the role of the Lebanese University, devise a plan to address the solid waste predicament and a public transport strategy, and resume the reimbursement of July war indemnities and approve the general amnesty law in compliance with the restraints that specify those worthy of pardon. \nNasrallah also maintained that the Syrian refugees must return to the safe areas inside Syria. \n\u201cWe will work on achieving this electoral program throughout the next four years,\u201d he pledged. \n\u201cSome have expected us to assume a role that we cannot play regarding the configuration of the electoral lists; we only exerted our best efforts and we cannot impose anything on anybody,\u201d he said. \n\u201cMy message for the allies and friends is to be modest and to make concessions (\u2026) conflict paves way for failure,\u201d he stressed. \n\u201cAs to the relations with the Free Patriotic Movement, our strategic ties are still valid and we shall carry on with our agreement after the elections,\u201d he maintained. \n\u201cThe President of the republic is entitled to call for talks over the national defense strategy and we do not have any reservations in that respect,\u201d he added. \nTurning to Rome II conference, Nasrallah voiced support for the efforts exerted to enable the Lebanese army to defend Lebanon. \n\u201cIf the government went to Paris to provide assistance, then this is excellent; but if it sought loans, the matter must be discussed inside the Cabinet and the Parliament.\u201d Tags", "highlightText": "",

the UN Human Rights Council extending the mandate of special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi deplored the resolution on Sunday, stressing that it shows limited number of countries' misuse of human rights mechanisms. \"In our view, the one-year extension of the mandate Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran lacks credibility and expert backup and was an unnecessary measure and therefore, a rapporteur appointed with such a suspicious backup faces a fundamental problem in his/her nobility and legitimacy,\" he added. The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Friday, extending the mandate on Iran. Some 21 members of the Council voted in favor of the resolution, while 7 others voted against, with 19 abstentions. Tehran had also in 2017 blasted the UN Human Rights Council's politically-motivated and selective approach, and asked the world body to put an end to the mission of the special human rights rapporteur in Iran. \"Given the noticeable human rights progress made in the Islamic Republic of Iran and its extensive and constructive interactions with the international human rights mechanisms, it is now time to end the special rapporteur's mission in an appropriate way,\" Qaribabadi said, addressing the annual meeting of the UN Human Rights Council underway in Geneva at the time.

The Islamic Republic of Iran's foreign ministry considers the dire humanitarian conditions in Yemen as highly regretting and believes that this war results in noting but instability, insecurity, massacre of people, destruction of infrastructures and increased activities of terrorist groups, the statement said. It warned that over 20mln people are on verge of famine and hunger misused by the Saudi-led coalition to pressure the Yemeni people, and underscored Iran's full preparedness to help the establishment of ceasefire and start of Yemeni-Yemeni talks. \"It is proper that the US and certain European countries adopt serious measures to stop war and continued war crimes in Yemen instead of supporting the aggressors and supply them with different types of arms and fighter jets,\" the statement added. It also called on the international community to increase pressures on the Saudi-led coalition to end aggression and siege on Yemen. Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen since March 2015 to restore power to fugitive president Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. The Saudi-led aggression has so far killed at least 15,700 Yemenis, including hundreds of women and children. Despite Riyadh's claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi bombers are flattening residential areas and civilian infrastructures. According to several reports, the Saudi-led air campaign against Yemen has driven the impoverished country towards humanitarian disaster, as Saudi Arabia's deadly campaign prevented the patients from travelling abroad for treatment and blocked the entry of medicine into the war-torn country. Yemen is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis with more than 22 million people in need and is seeing a spike in needs, fuelled by ongoing conflict, a collapsing economy and diminished social services and livelihoods.

Kadkhodayee's remarks came after US President Donald Trump announced plans on Thursday to replace his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, with John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN and a military intervention hawk. Bolton, as the American sponsor of anti-Iran Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) terrorist group, has managed to grab the highest political position in Trump's government, Kadkhodayee wrote on his Telegram channel on Friday. He wrote that the MKO, the most hated terrorist group among the Iranians, has carried out numerous terrorist attacks against the Iranian civilians and government officials and sided with the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, during the eight-year Iraqi-imposed war against Iran in the 1980s. \"Now the question is why Bolton has been assumed to a sensitive position, while he is a stubborn supporter of anti-Iran terrorist group, the MKO,\" he asked. The MKO, founded in the 1960s, blended elements of Islamism and Stalinism and participated in the overthrow of the US-backed Shah of Iran in 1979. Ahead of the revolution, the MKO conducted attacks and assassinations against both Iranian and western targets. The group started assassination of the citizens and officials after the revolution in a bid to take control of the newly-established Islamic Republic. It killed several of Iran's new leaders in the early years after the revolution, including the then President, Mohammad Ali Rajayee, Prime Minister, Mohammad Javad Bahonar and the Judiciary Chief, Mohammad Hossein Beheshti who were killed in bomb attacks by the MKO members in 1981. The group fled to Iraq in 1986, where it was protected by Saddam Hussein and where it helped the Iraqi dictator suppress Shiite and Kurd uprisings in the country. The terrorist group joined Saddam's army during the Iraqi imposed war on Iran (1980-1988) and helped Saddam and killed thousands of Iranian civilians and soldiers during the US-backed Iraqi imposed war on Iran. Since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, the group, which now adheres to a pro-free-market philosophy, has been strongly backed by neo-conservatives in the United States, who argued for the MKO to be taken off the US terror list. The US formally removed the MKO from its list of terror organizations in September 2012, one week after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent the US Congress a classified communication about the move. The decision made by Clinton enabled the group to have its assets under the US jurisdiction unfrozen and do business with the American entities, the State Department said in a statement at the time. In September 2012, the last groups of the MKO terrorists left Camp Ashraf, their main training center in Iraq's Diyala province. They have been transferred to Camp Liberty. Hundreds of the MKO terrorists have now been sent to Europe, where their names were taken off the blacklist even two years before the US. The MKO has assassinated over 12,000 Iranians in the last 4 decades. The terrorist group had even killed large numbers of Americans and Europeans in several terror attacks before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Some 17,000 Iranians have lost their lives in terror attacks in the 35 years after the Revolution. Rumors were confirmed in September 2016 about the death of MKO ringleader, Massoud Rajavi, as a former top Saudi intelligence official disclosed in a gaffe during an address to his followers. Rajavi's death was revealed after Turki al-Faisal who was attending the MKO annual gathering in Paris made a gaffe and spoke of the terrorist group's ringleader as the \"late Rajavi\" twice. Faced with Faisal's surprising gaffe, Rajavi's wife, Maryam, changed her happy face with a complaining gesture and cued the interpreter to be watchful of translation words and exclude the gaffe from the Persian translation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bolton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john bolton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas ali kadkhodayee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadkhodayee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h.r. mcmaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saddam husse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mojahedin-e khalq organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telegram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mujahedin-e khalq organization", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T15:59:54.095+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcef24ed1179c72b6c52ec06669234d5707d4fa9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiy3To73ytk0adWK7rhirNLCYXrU.lItf_OjWA6xIBBuoci2rpIk2FFMW4FGa9nnWkP7lZe66pIpZ0P2Pl31g8QbQfLS9S.pD0A..1Hp5oG7P05Z_QhPT", "site_full": "en.mehrnews.com", "site": "mehrnews.com", "site_section": "http://en.mehrnews.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Mehrnews English", "title": "Pres.

The Arabic-language Sputnik news agency quoted a military source as saying that the terrorists in Eastern Ghouta - as the main bastion of the terrorists trained by foreign military experts - have been surprised by the Syrian army's high momentum marches. \"Terrorists have dug a large number of trenches and tunnels and established different bases to confront the Syrian army in the past 7 years,\" the report said, \"Yet, the Syrian army's operation room has set up a database of targets with the help of the intel collected by the drone. The date includes warehouses and caches of weapons and ammunition and roads used to transfer the arms supplies and militants across the terrorist-held regions.\" In a relevant development early this month, the Syrian army launched a nightly raid on al-Nusra Front (Tahrir al-Sham Hay'at or the Levant Liberation Board) in Eastern Ghouta, capturing one of the most important and longest tunnels used by the terrorists. Field sources reported that the army forces killed and wounded tens of terrorists during military operations in Eastern Ghouta which led to the liberation of Hawsh al-Zawaherah and the nearby areas after the end of the daily ceasefire.

Adalah sent an urgent letter on Wednesday to Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit and the Israel Land Authority demanding that they postpone the eviction of residents and demolition of their homes, WAFA reported. Israeli police forces entered Umm al-Hiran on Wednesday in preparation for the April demolitions, posting eviction notices on homes and the village's mosque. The notices specified that Israeli authorities will carry out demolitions at some point between April 15 and 29. Adalah attorneys Suhad Bishara and Myssana Morany wrote in the urgent letter that the demolition of Umm al-Hiran will leave its 350 residents \u2013 including many women and children \u2013 homeless. \"Despite the state's obligations and promises to the Supreme Court, these [eviction] notices have been delivered before a just arrangement has been reached with residents and before they have been ensured an adequate and available housing solution. All of this is taking place in the shadow of the racist and discriminatory aims of the Hiran settlement association which will, apparently, be involved in allocating land plots in [the new town of] Hiran,\" set to be built on the ruins of Umm al-Hiran, the letter said. The Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that \"the planned town will not prevent [those from Bedouin villages] from living there and anyone who wishes to live in Hiran is entitled to do so.\" But despite the state's repeated promises to the court that Hiran would accept all new residents \u2013 regardless of religion or ethnic background \u2013 this is not the case and Hiran is, in fact, closed to non-Jewish residents. Hiran's cooperative association bylaws specified that only Orthodox Jews will be permitted to live in the new town, according to a document uncovered by Adalah in August 2017. The bylaws read that \"an individual may be approved by the admissions committee and become a member of the Hiran cooperative association if they meet the following qualifications: a Jewish Israeli citizen or permanent resident of Israel who observes the Torah and commandments according to Orthodox Jewish values\u2026 .\" Attorneys Bishara and Morany emphasized that Bedouin families who have already been uprooted from Umm al-Hiran and transferred to other locations are now living in inhumane conditions, despite the promises of Israeli authorities. Umm al-Hiran families forced by Israeli authorities to sign transfer agreements and to leave their village \"live today in dangerous temporary structures without even the most minimal living conditions, and without any hookups to basic infrastructure such as water, electricity, or sewage\", attorneys Bishara and Morany wrote.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avichai mandelblit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suhad bishara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adalah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myssana morany", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israel land authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legal center for arab minority rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wafa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "umm al-hiran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:08:41.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a4f075c4742fbf94069b5121927dc4a2ffdcbe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JCD96adeiirwwcEJ_vqBHtEV.IPrbadpbXvdrWe3j1mhsB_TL964Lg8cTFMzOS.WQ-", "site_full": "en.farsnews.com", "site": "farsnews.com", "site_section": "http://en.farsnews.com//rss.aspx?srv=426", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Fars News Agency", "title": "A New Low for Saudi Arabia and Its Persian Gulf Allies", "title_full": "A New Low for Saudi Arabia and Its Persian Gulf Allies", "published": "2018-03-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 794, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a4f075c4742fbf94069b5121927dc4a2ffdcbe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JCD96adeiirwwcEJ_vqBHtEV.IPrbadpbXvdrWe3j1mhsB_TL964Lg8cTFMzOS.WQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A New Low for Saudi Arabia and Its Persian Gulf Allies", "text": "Fri Mar 23, 2018 10:0 A New Low for Saudi Arabia and Its Persian Gulf Allies Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- First it was their failed regime-change war against Syria in alliance with the United States and Israel that killed tens of thousands of people and made millions more refugees in a period of seven years. Then their three-year war on Yemen that turned the poorest country in the Arab world into the worst humanitarian disaster of the 21st century. Now the United Nations say, there are no clear and strong legal parameters in the Persian Gulf Arab countries to protect the most vulnerable of Asian and African migrants from denial of access to fundamental rights. A new report by the UN\u2019s proposed Global Compact on Migration, currently under negotiation by UN member states, which covers a wide range of issues on labor and human rights, and is a significant opportunity to improve the governance on migration and to address the challenges associated with today\u2019s migration, says, the Persian Gulf Arab countries (mainly   United Arab Emirates) need to address the specific issues faced by Asian and African workers as they comprise a significant part of the regional workforce in informal employment and are among the most vulnerable groups of workers. The Persian Gulf region has an estimated 2.4 million migrant workers, traditionally recruited from Asia - mostly from the Philippines, Indonesia and India. All foreign workers in the Persian Gulf fall under the Kafala (a visa-sponsorship) system which does not allow them to leave or change employers without their initial employer\u2019s consent. If they do, they can be arrested and punished for \u201cabsconding\u201d with fines, detention, and deportation. Most Persian Gulf Arab countries claim they have begun pushing some sort of reforms when it comes to labor laws for migrant workers, but these are just words. For instance, they claim they adopted bills on migrant workers that for the first time guarantees a weekly day of rest and some other end-of-service payment. While a significant advance, these draft laws (emphasis here) still fall short of the International Labor Organization\u2019s Domestic Workers Convention, \u201cas they provide fewer protections than those accorded other workers under labor laws. They also don\u2019t guarantee their basic human rights,\u201d according to a statement by Human Rights Watch. This includes weak migrant worker regulations with no penalties for employer breaches, and no labor rights in law. The Persian Gulf Arab states claim they have been making reforms in their labor laws. But the very essence of this system of Kafala is very harsh and exploitative because the sponsor basically has absolute power over their employees. This forces migrant workers to work in isolation and harsh conditions and are vulnerable to sexual and other forms of abuse. Some have even been murdered by their employees with no charges filed against them. To substantiate, just earlier this month, the Philippines barred its nationals from seeking domestic positions in Kuwait after a Filipina maid was found dead in a freezer in her employer\u2019s home, which officials in Manila state was merely one of many similarly unacceptable incidents in the Persian Gulf state. The same problem exists in   UAE where the authorities refuse to ink any agreement with the Asian states to reassure greater protection and a stronger regulatory framework for migrant workers and those low-skilled nationals working or seeking work. Far from it, several reports, including one by Human Rights Watch, show that ever since Asian countries like India and the Philippines began tightening regulations to protect their nationals, Arab recruiters have been expanding their demand for cheap domestic labor into East Africa - especially in nations where poverty and high unemployment make the offer of work in the Persian Gulf hard to refuse. Just like their Asian counterparts, African migrant workers also think they are going to have a lot of money and become rich. But they don\u2019t know that they are going to be exploited and their basic human rights violated. Their dream jobs that should allow them to support their families back home mostly means spending years virtually imprisoned in their employers\u2019 houses, being exploited and mistreated, and allowed only two meals of leftovers a day. Sadly enough, all these damning human rights reports haven\u2019t stopped the highly selective Trump White House from inking new lucrative business deals with the Persian Gulf Arab states, including arms sales that are mainly used by America\u2019s patrons against innocent civilians in the war zones of Yemen and Syria. This shows much better how   and his top leadership largely ignore human rights issues, long claimed to be important to US foreign policy, for the sake of money and regional designs - the full range of rights important to everyone, including those migrant workers trapped in the Persian Gulf. Instead, the selective foreign policymakers at the white House approve appalling arms sales worth hundreds of billions of dollars all while giving short shrift to the very values and rights that the US has long used to justify wars, sanctions and regime change against other nations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "global compact", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new low", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "persian gulf arab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:13:39.035+03:00"}], "totalResults": 88, "moreResultsAvailable": 78, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746324193&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIR+location%3ATehran&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 871, "extra": {"place": "Tehran", "country": "IR", "lat": "35.5770451", "lng": "51.4624642"}}
