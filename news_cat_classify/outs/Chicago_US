He plopped down on his back, smiled like a guy who knew something \u2014 and darn it if he didn\u2019t do a little snow-angel maneuver right there on the court. Richardson completed the four-point play to give the Ramblers a 15-point lead with nearly 17 minutes to go, but maybe that was it right there. Maybe this Elite Eight no-contest was over. Maybe it was over before it even started. Loyola destroyed the major-conference Wildcats 78-62. The Ramblers toyed with them, messed with their minds, stole their souls. By God, Loyola \u2014 for the first time in 55 years \u2014 is going to the Final Four. \nLoyola's Ben Richardson in the midst of his second-half four-point play. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) \nRELATED STORIES Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told \u2018\u2018Chicago, you can be really proud,\u2019\u2019 coach Porter Moser said from the postgame stage at halfcourt, confetti falling. Proud, yes, and thankful, too. Chicago is something of a basketball wasteland nowadays without the 32-5 Ramblers, owners of the most victories \u2014 by three and counting \u2014 in school history. Save the tank talk about the Bulls. Let Northwestern and Illinois fight over the right-now-meaningless moniker of \u2018\u2018Chicago\u2019s Big Ten Team.\u2019\u2019 The Ramblers are Chicago\u2019s Big-Time Team. They\u2019re national darlings. They darn sure deserve to be local treasures. \u2018\u2018Oh, my gosh, yes, these guys deserve that,\u2019\u2019 said a beaming Jerry Harkness, 77, the star of Loyola\u2019s 1962-63 national-championship squad, as players younger by two generations cut down the nets. \u2018\u2018These guys are awesome. I am so proud of them and so happy that I got to be here for this.\u2019\u2019 Les Hunter, 75, the center on that great Ramblers team, shook his head in bewilderment. \u2018\u2018I was hoping they would make another run like this in my lifetime, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see it,\u2019\u2019 he said. Who could have seen all this coming? But the better team \u2014 the much better team \u2014 punched its ticket to San Antonio on a Saturday instantly seared into Ramblers lore. Kansas State coach Bruce Weber wrote two words on the grease board in his locker room before the game: \u2018\u2018toughness\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018discipline.\u2019\u2019 A fat lot of good that did him. \u2018\u2018They were tougher than us from the get-go,\u2019\u2019 Weber said. \u2018\u2018They were physical, very disciplined.\u2019\u2019 They were the team they\u2019ve been all season. Let it be known that Moser\u2019s famous jacket came off sometime in the second half and that Sister Jean, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain, was her lovely, cheerful self before the game. But let\u2019s dispense with the romance for a moment and ponder what once was unthinkable: Loyola isn\u2019t merely back in the Final Four; it has a chance to hold its own there and even run away with the trophy. Have you been watching this tournament? If you have, then you know anything is possible. The Ramblers are going back to Texas, where this incredible Big Dance started. Against Kansas State, they went back to the way they\u2019d started in the first round against Miami: by jumping out to a nice lead and announcing to the world that they belonged and to their opponents that the next two hours were going to be hard as hell. Not even five minutes into the game, the Ramblers led 12-5 and all five starters \u2014 Clayton Custer, Marques Townes, Donte Ingram, Cameron Krutwig and Richardson \u2014 had scored. All game long, they drove and shot with the sort of decisiveness and alacrity that 300 Division I coaches only wish they had on their squad. Another close call? Not a chance. After winning their first three tournament games by a combined four points, the Ramblers said enough. It was time to make an opponent from the big-boy Big 12 suffer. \u2018\u2018We had no answer for them,\u2019\u2019 the Wildcats\u2019 Cartier Diarra said. \u2018\u2018So all credit to them. They are a great team, and hopefully they make it all the way.\u2019\u2019 Next up is Michigan at the Alamodome next Saturday. Chicago\u2019s Big Time Team will be ready. \u2018\u2018When it\u2019s time to lock in, they are locked in,\u2019\u2019 Moser said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s because they want to win; it\u2019s in their genes. They are winning young men.\u2019\u2019 And they\u2019ve won over their city. Moser was sure to give a tip of his Final Four cap to the school paper, which has been there from the beginning. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s been quite a metamorphosis,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018because the Loyola Phoenix was the only one in the press conference for about 20 games.\u2019\u2019 We\u2019re all here now.

But the most memorable moments came from the students.\nThe Chicago high schooler who was threatened with a gun and told to say nothing \u2014 who then shared her story with the world. The Los Angeles teen who lost her brother to gun violence. The Parkland survivor who brought the rally to a standstill for 6 minutes 20 seconds.\nWe\u2019ve collected these and other notable moments:\nEmma Gonz\u00e1lez stands in silence\nThe final speaker of the rally stood in silence for 6 minutes 20 seconds to mark the amount of time it took for a gunman to kill 17 people and injure 15 at her high school.\n\u201cIn a little over six minutes, 17 of our friends were taken from us,\u201d Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cEverybody who has been touched by the cold grip of gun violence understands.\u201d\nGonz\u00e1lez listed the students who died and then stood in silence, staring straight into the crowd. A few minutes into the silence, the crowd started to chant, \u201cNever again!\u201d\nWhen the time elapsed, Gonz\u00e1lez told the crowd, \u201cFight for your lives before it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job.\u201d\n\u201cI have a dream that enough is enough.\u201d\nYolanda Renee King, 9, the granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr., made an appearance with her own dream at the rally.\n\u201cI have a dream that enough is enough,\u201d she said, \u201cand that this should be a gun-free world. Period.\u201d\nShe then led the crowd in a cheer: \u201cWe are going to be a great generation.\u201d\n\u201cToday is the March for Our Lives, but it\u2019s also the birthday of Nick Dworet.\u201d\nOne of the survivors of the Parkland shooting went on stage to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for her deceased friend, Nicholas Dworet, who would have turned 18 on Saturday.\n\u201cIt is also the birthday of Nick Dworet. Somebody who was senselessly murdered in front of me,\u201d said 18-year-old Samantha Fuentes, who was shot by the gunman Feb. 14. Dworet was a senior at Stoneman Douglas and a competitive swimmer at the high school. He was planning to attend the University of Indianapolis on an athletic scholarship.\nFuentes asked the crowd to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for her friend, and they did.\n\u201cI have been personally affected by the lack of gun control\u201d\nMya Middleton, a 16-year-old student from Chicago, spoke about her own harrowing experience with gun violence. When she was a freshman in high school, Middleton went to pick up some items from the store when an agitated customer began grabbing items and causing a commotion.\n\u201cWhen he finally turns to me, he comes toward me, and I couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t think,\u201d she recalled.\n\u201cHe pulls out this silver pistol and points it in my face and said these words that to this day haunt me and give me nightmares. He said, \u2018If you say anything, I will find you.\u2019 And yet I\u2019m still saying something today.\u201d\n\u201cGuns have long scared our children,\u201d she said. \u201cJoin me in sharing my pain and my anger.\u201d\n\u201cI learned how to duck from bullets before I learned how to read.\u201d\nEdna Chavez, 17, from south Los Angeles, lost her brother in a shooting. \u201cRicardo was his name. Can y\u2019all say it with me?\u201d she asked the crowd.\nThe protesters began chanting \u201cRicardo! Ricardo!\u201d as tears began to stream down Chavez\u2019s face.\n\u201cThis is normal. Normal to the point where I\u2019ve learned to duck from bullets before I learned how to read,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset going down on South Central. You hear pops thinking they\u2019re fireworks. They weren\u2019t pops. You see the melanin in your brother\u2019s skin turn gray.\u201d\n\u201cThis march is not the climax. It\u2019s the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the revolution,\u201d said Cameron Kasky. One the most visible of the Parkland students, Kasky urged young people to use their voices to \u201ccreate a better world for generations to come.\u201d\n\u201cPoliticians, either represent the people or get out. Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming,\u201d Kasky said. \u201cWe must stand beside those we\u2019ve lost and fix the world that betrayed them. \u2026 We the people can fix this.

What they want is an easy win. They want to cast the National Rifle Association as the epitome of evil. An army of children is marching on Washington this weekend, and they want to take semi-automatic rifles away, specifically, the spooky AR-15 rifle.\nIf they were actually serious about gun violence, they\u2019d be talking about places like Chicago and they\u2019d lobby for further regulation of or outright ban on the sale of handguns. Yes, the real numbers actually show rifles are among the safest firearms for an American to own. According to the FBI, Americans are roughly 20 times more likely to die at the end of a handgun.\nYet, handguns are definitively not part of the script the media follows when a mass shooting occurs in America. First, blue check marks start tweeting for gun control while the bodies are still warm. Second come the spin masters like Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun Everytown USA , which got basically the entire media to repeat a wildly false statistic that 18 school shootings had occurred in 2018. Third come the \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d opeds, lately from veterans quick to use their service as a lecturing device.\nFinally, the big brands come out to play.\nWe get scary posts on the AR-15 like this one from a two-time Pulitzer recipient at The New York Times , which notes that \u201c173 people have been killed in mass shootings in the United States involving AR-15s, according to a New York Times analysis.\u201d Of course, the article \u2014 which reads like a less dishonest version of a press release from Everytown \u2014 is missing the context on handguns. How else would they have fit in the swipe at the NRA, the Quote: from a military veteran for gun control, and all the terrifying language about the infantry\u2019s use of AR-15s?\nIf we\u2019re to restrict gun deaths to just mass shootings, according to Statista (which uses the FBI\u2019s methodology), handguns are about twice as likely to be used as rifles . We saw the results of handguns on soft targets in the Ft. Hood and Charleston church shootings. Except that it\u2019s much easier to conceal a handgun, there is virtually no difference between a semi-automatic handgun and a rifle when it comes to attacking a close-quarters, defenseless environment like a school or a church.\nThe \u201c173 deaths since 2007\u201d number is also highly misleading out of context. Roughly four times that number died by gunfire in Chicago in a single year.\nStill, not a word about Chicago gun violence from the media and gun control advocates in this recent cycle, while they loudly claim to be the white knights of gun violence.\nTheir proposed regulations also fit the typical script in that they will have almost no effect on the problem. Raise the age of sales to 21? Average age of a mass shooter is 32. Ban the sale of AR-15s? There are dozens of magazine-fed carbines on the market. Ban the sale of semi-automatic rifles? Most mass shootings occur with handguns.\nNo no, you\u2019ll hear at their march on DC Saturday, their mascot is definitively the AR-15. Mostly because they just have to do something. But the numbers they carry with them are misleading or false. Their propositions, like banning the AR-15, won\u2019t prevent a determined mass murderer.\nBut, they assure you, they\u2019re totally serious about the problem.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "everytown usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T07:04:01.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "358817d80abf3bfcd394e9c980a8153095be1880", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcXRd25KUrf8vmWTadaoicgnEt7j08vZqSOCx2XyeOydbdt4cHQNJ3JcBGz4XhVc7lmaFPjhxVzbZEYX._3bEnaFqJWbPvW1104Sbb6hzMgFKhOwX.zXBXGjSxJpGgWCtOwEHY0eDJZryrX5jXdegA9I42TYEd2F4-", "site_full": "chicago.suntimes.com", "site": "suntimes.com", "site_section": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "title_full": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "published": "2018-03-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/937528560_75244029.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 7113, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1024, "comments": 0, "shares": 1024}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "358817d80abf3bfcd394e9c980a8153095be1880", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcXRd25KUrf8vmWTadaoicgnEt7j08vZqSOCx2XyeOydbdt4cHQNJ3JcBGz4XhVc7lmaFPjhxVzbZEYX._3bEnaFqJWbPvW1104Sbb6hzMgFKhOwX.zXBXGjSxJpGgWCtOwEHY0eDJZryrX5jXdegA9I42TYEd2F4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rick Morrissey", "published": "2018-03-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "text": "Loyola is going to the Final Four.

(Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nNow they\u2019re going to San Antonio to play in a national semifinal game against Michigan. It means that everything you think you knew about anything is wrong. If Loyola can be one game from a chance to win an NCAA title, you\u2019d be wise to re-examine your entire life.\nThe Ramblers beat Kansas State 78-62 Saturday in Atlanta, continuing their ridiculously fun ride. Where it will stop, nobody with a working brain knows.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even feel real,\u2019\u2019 guard Ben Richardson said afterward.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t.\nAfter watching Loyola win four games in the tournament, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised anymore. But the Ramblers are an 11 th seed, and no matter how capricious March Madness can be, what they\u2019ve done is still stunning.\nThey\u2019ll beat you any way you want. Where they beat Nevada on Thursday with layups, they beat Kansas State on Saturday with a barrage of three-pointers. Where they won their first three games of the tournament with last-gasp shots, they won Saturday\u2019s game with a relentlessness that built a 23-point lead and then with a steel-reinforced confidence to overcome a Kansas State comeback.\nThe Ramblers do two things very well. They move the ball, and they play hard defense. Throughout the tournament, they have made opponents look slow. That\u2019s not supposed to happen, but they have made a lot of things happen that weren\u2019t supposed to happen. It\u2019s tiring just watching them run around the floor.\nFor the longest time, the ninth-seeded Wildcats couldn\u2019t keep up. And it didn\u2019t look like they had anyone who could score, which in basketball is what is called \u201ca problem.\u201d Then they came roaring back, going on a 14-3 run to cut a 61-38 lead to 64-52 with 4:19 left.\nA lesser team, a team that might have started to believe it didn\u2019t belong \u2013 basically, any team not named \u201cLoyola\u2019\u2019 \u2013 might have caved in. Not this team. The Ramblers bounced back.\nMarques Townes, the hero of the Nevada game, made two free throws and converted a three-point play to push the lead back up to 17. And they stayed the course and played their game and did all the corny things that coaches tell their teams to do. That\u2019s what mature players do.\nThe Ramblers don\u2019t have one big star. They have six lesser stars, and the wattage is superior. When big man Cameron Krutwig backed into the poor guy trying to defend him, it looked like he was using his butt to close the refrigerator door during a late-night raid. The Wildcats didn\u2019t know what to do when he set screens.\nThe Ramblers have point guard Clayton Custer, who has a name like a gunslinger from the Old West and shoots like one, too. They have Richardson, who had a career-high 23 points. Everybody who gets playing time for Loyola can score. The Ramblers shot 57.4 percent from the field and were 9-for-18 on three-point attempts.\n\u201cThe ball usually finds the hot hand,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said.\nNo, it\u2019s not the greatest basketball. It\u2019s not the NBA. But in terms of execution, in terms of setting picks, making the right pass and playing shrink-wrap defense, it\u2019s terrific. In terms of excitement, in terms of gnawed fingernails, shared experiences and school pride, it\u2019s all that\u2019s right with the game.\nThe Ramblers have won 14 straight games and 21 of their last 22. We didn\u2019t see them coming, and we should have. They were exactly the type of team that could do damage in the NCAA Tournament. Five players averaging double figures, two guys who had played high school ball together and a group of people that seemed to err on the side of unselfishness, if there is such a thing as that. That\u2019s what Loyola is, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to San Antonio.\nIt\u2019s the Ramblers\u2019 first trip to the Final Four since 1963, when they won the national championship.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whom they play, even third-seeded Michigan. They\u2019re an 11 th seed and not anything close to an underdog.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable group,\u2019\u2019 coach Porter Moser said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you believe. They\u2019ve believed and believed and believed.\u2019\u2019\nIn terms of self-belief, they\u2019re a No.1 seed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben richardson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald martinez/getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "loyola", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramblers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T05:13:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a9d0b73401f1dfb1f0d0cb30515781858820154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpJ_AJul8iHvc1TNuEiLQ1CBs4kC_JHwHqNzP7KrbnzWNOxm7I_fnNtNj4BQQNb7oQ_7VIKpGfsEuvkw9Mu_gFvIS_0FV5_3jgKmzVR81tFTg--", "site_full": "time.com", "site": "time.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Martin Luther King's Granddaughter Speaks at March | Time", "title_full": "Martin Luther King's Granddaughter Speaks at March | Time", "published": "2018-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.58, "main_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/yolanda-renee-king.jpg?quality&#x3D;85", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 643, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1869, "comments": 0, "shares": 1869}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a9d0b73401f1dfb1f0d0cb30515781858820154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpJ_AJul8iHvc1TNuEiLQ1CBs4kC_JHwHqNzP7KrbnzWNOxm7I_fnNtNj4BQQNb7oQ_7VIKpGfsEuvkw9Mu_gFvIS_0FV5_3jgKmzVR81tFTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Calfas", "published": "2018-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Martin Luther King's Granddaughter Speaks at March | Time", "text": "\u201cI have a dream that enough is enough.\u201d\nNine-year-old Yolanda Renee King invoked the famous words of her grandfather Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2013 and gave them a 2018 twist \u2013 as she spoke to the tens of thousands of protesters demanding gun control at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., Saturday.\nIn a surprise appearance amid a series of speeches from students impacted from gun violence in Parkland, Chicago, southern California and elsewhere, Yolanda spoke on a similar platform as her grandfather did 55 years early when he inspired generations with his historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech at the March on Washington in 1963.\n\u201cMy grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of the skin, but the content of their character,\u201d said Yolanda, standing alongside Parkland shooting survivor Jaclyn Corin. \u201cI have a dream that enough is enough.

But they had a different idea of the problem. Destini Philpot, another student at Baltimore City College, was joined on Saturday in Washington by Carrie Zaremba, a student at the Friends School of Baltimore, a predominantly white Quaker institution. The two said they had helped organize a citywide walkout this month that involved both public and private schools. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence,\u201d Ms. Zaremba said. Ms. Philpot said that many of those at the rally were thinking of gun violence in the only way they knew how: as mass shootings.

Private donors paid for 60 buses that carried around 3,000 Baltimore students to the Washington event. Some Baltimore organizers skipped their city\u2019s satellite march to attend the one in the capital, hoping to reach an audience largely unfamiliar with the kind of violence that visits them with gruesome regularity. One of those organizers, Erricka Bridgeford, has helped work on a campaign called Baltimore Ceasefire, which holds quarterly \u201ccease-fire\u201d weekends that call for a stop to killings for a three-day period. On Saturday, she recalled what had brought her to Washington: the lasting agony from losing her brother, stepson and friends to gun violence. \nAdvertisement   \u201cI\u2019ve seen dead bodies and blood,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are things you never recover from.

He was the flight commander charged with landing on the moon. After an oxygen tank exploded, Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise had to call off their mission and figure out how to get back to Earth.\nTwenty-five years later, actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in a Hollywood film about their epic journey.\nApollo 13 astronauts Fred Haise, James Lovell, and John Swigert (left to right) leave a helicopter to step aboard the carrier Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean after their successful recovery. | AP\nWe\u2019d like to give this American hero, who lives in a north suburb of Chicago, a shout-out as he turns 90 Sunday. Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium is celebrating Lovell\u2019s achievements in a yearlong campaign , encouraging space fans to write Lovell notes to let him know what kind of impact his space travels had on them.\nEDITORIAL\nLovell\u2019s name is synonymous with Apollo 13, but we\u2019ll never forget his Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It was the first manned flight to break from the Earth\u2019s orbit and travel around the moon.\nRELATED: Lovell spoke to Sun-Times reporter Robert Herguth about his faith in a podcast last year.\nWe asked author Robert Kurson, whose book \u201cRocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man\u2019s First Journey to the Moon\u201d will be out next month, to give a few good reasons to celebrate Lovell today. Here\u2019s his excellent list:\nJim Lovell donated many of his coolest space-related memorabilia and artifacts to the Adler Planetarium, giving Chicagoans and other visitors an intimate glimpse into the early years of space travel and exploration. He is a wonderful explainer and storyteller who often makes himself available to media and others who are interested in NASA, space, the Moon, and the future of space travel. He is a devoted husband, father and family man who has been married to the same woman, Marilyn, for 65 years. (Astronaut life was notoriously hard on marriages. In fact, the crew of Apollo 8 \u2014 Frank Borman, Lovell, and Bill Anders \u2014 is the only crew from either the Gemini or Apollo programs whose marriages all survived intact.) He is not just one of the nicest astronauts you\u2019ll meet, he\u2019s one of the nicest people you\u2019ll meet, a reputation that goes back to his earliest days with NASA. Unlike some astronauts, he dreamed as a kid of flying on rockets into space and exploring the cosmos, and he seems to have lost little of that boyhood wonder for exploration to this day. He had a golden retriever that liked to watch the Apollo 13 movie when it played on television at his home. Happy Birthday, Commander James Lovell. You continue to make Chicago proud.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james lovell", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lovell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack swigert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom hanks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john swigert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred haise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adler planetarium", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iwo jima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:00:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bea6655692ef7d84829325a682e82fdb4e6595a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkwVaGhVHmvwudpRXhsOkpMqZIGF1QfNuNv3k46NUcbYScnw1ZrKmc2fmCAOHBV2oYP23lPGsmvc_USr.R.ufyp4EnC8LndUPuBPpagIEpbMy6QkbHmz4rEA--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Breaking News Stories from US and Around the World | MSN News", "title": "Investigators say missing Iowa family found dead in Mexico", "title_full": "Investigators say missing Iowa family found dead in Mexico", "published": "2018-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3335, "comments": 0, "shares": 3335}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bea6655692ef7d84829325a682e82fdb4e6595a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkwVaGhVHmvwudpRXhsOkpMqZIGF1QfNuNv3k46NUcbYScnw1ZrKmc2fmCAOHBV2oYP23lPGsmvc_USr.R.ufyp4EnC8LndUPuBPpagIEpbMy6QkbHmz4rEA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2018-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Investigators say missing Iowa family found dead in Mexico", "text": "Investigators say missing Iowa family found dead in Mexico Associated Press 1 hr ago Click to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Gun Violence Victims Head to DC for March The March for Our Lives is expected to bring over 500,000 to the capital Saturday.

Creston police contacted the U.S. Department of State, and the bodies were found during a welfare check at the condo in Tulum, on the Yucatan Peninsula.\nIn Mexico, the Quintana Roo state prosecutors office tweeted that the bodies were found in a tourist compound. The office said that \"no signs of violence were found on the bodies or in the room,\" though authorities said it wasn't immediately clear what caused the deaths. Autopsy reports were pending.\nIowa authorities identified the family as 41-year-old Kevin Sharp; his wife, 38-year-old Amy Sharp; and their children, 12-year-old Sterling and 7-year-old Adrianna.\nReached Friday, the developer of the condo complex where the deaths occurred declined to comment.\nThe Creston News Advertiser newspaper in Iowa reported that the family flew to Cancun, Mexico, on March 14. According to her sister, Amy Sharp texted their mother the next day to say they'd reached Tulum, but relatives hadn't heard from the family since then.\nThe sister, Renee Hoyt, said the Sharps were scheduled to return to the U.S. this week. They were scheduled to depart from the Cancun airport on Wednesday and fly to St. Louis on a non-stop flight. The family had planned to then drive about 200 miles (322 kilometers) to Danville, Illinois, to watch a basketball game Thursday, Hoyt said.\nWhen the family didn't arrive in St. Louis, family members contacted authorities, she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/eb91e1e2-c54b-4a3f-bc3c-9b7e1dfef8eb/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e7d00.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/74364f0f-6298-4386-98b8-96c39eb4e480/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e.ism/manifest&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-vid", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBKCyOS%3focid%3dst&text=Police%3a+Family+Of+4+From+Iowa+Found+Dead+In+Mexico&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBKCyOS%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBKCyOS?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBKCyOS%3focid%3dss&lang=en-us&flow_id=947d1d5c-80e4-4722-8527-5d0d4cc17573&source=msn", "http://cbslocal-download.s3.amazonaws.com/anv-playlists/feeds/xml/164.xml&quot;}", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBKCg5e.img&quot;}}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBKCyOS%3focid%3dsl&title=Police%3a+Family+Of+4+From+Iowa+Found+Dead+In+Mexico&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBKCyOS%3focid%3dsl", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/74364f0f-6298-4386-98b8-96c39eb4e480/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/7474aa84-ac77-4e80-b78a-c290a90385fa/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e_1280x720_4049.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/e1601c12-14ab-4e97-a5fc-3456fe81e16e/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e_320x180_527.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/8ec9c357-31c9-47c0-b218-8d7c34b384ab/3936933f-a95b-46ca-a96d-b851757e_640x360_1428.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;ht"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jillian kitchener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diego pfeiffer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mexico associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters america trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa found dead in mexico cbs dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press parkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:01:46.017+03:00"}], "totalResults": 3895, "moreResultsAvailable": 3885, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745567458&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AUS+location%3AChicago&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 944, "extra": {"place": "Chicago", "country": "US", "lat": "41.8781136", "lng": "-87.6297982"}}
