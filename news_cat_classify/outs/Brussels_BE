On 24 March, the world, including people in Brussels, will join a \"march for our lives\". The Brussels event will start at 15.00 on the Place de la Monnaie. \n\"Students around the globe recognise that everyone should feel safe in school,\" said organiser Miles Herszenhorn, a 15-year-old American student living in Brussels. \nHe said one of the main reasons why he organised this event is because he is constantly worrying about his cousins' safety in their schools back in the States. \n\"I hope we send a strong message to American students: the international community hears you and supports you,\" he added. \nDemocrats Abroad Belgium is teaming up with Herszenhorn and other youth activists to allow people from all over Belgium to come and have their voices be heard. \nPauline Manos, chair of Democrats Abroad Belgium, said the young students taking a stance and challenging gun laws inspire her. \n\"Gun control in the US is a non-partisan issue that affects us all,\" Manos said. \"As a mother about to send her son to the US on a study abroad programme, I can't help but be concerned for his safety.\" Written by Molly Dove Before you can comment you first need to register or login This site uses cookies.

An ENTSO-E's dedicated project team is preparing the proposal following the specifications enclosed in the GLEB Art. 52(2). To incorporate the opinion of stakeholders in the drafting process of the All-TSO proposal, ENTSO-E plans to organise an informal workshop, and by that gather different points of view and comments. The workshop will be held in Brussels, at the ENTSO-E premises on 23 March. The intention of this workshop is to gather ideas that can help improving the proposal under development. The workshop is not part of a public consultation, nor will formal or informal ENTSO-E positions be shared. However presentations will be given on the scope, planning and outcomes of a survey performed amongst all TSOs, including third parties entrusted with settlement tasks on the topic of imbalance settlement. This introduction will be followed by a set of round-table sessions on the following sub-topics: Main components for calculation of the imbalance price Definition of the value of avoided activation Conditions for application of dual pricing Finalisation of imbalance adjustment, position and allocated volume \u200b The maximum number of attendants will be 100 people. Please contact Ricardo Renedo Williams ( ricardo.renedowilliams@entsoe.eu ) for registration before Friday 16 March . If you have any preference on which tables to attend, or any other questions, please also inform Ricardo.

The 6th Award for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMP) was presented to Turda (Romania). Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc said: \" ...these cities are not only creating a more sustainable Europe, but are helping their residents to move around in a cleaner, healthier and more enjoyable way. It is my hope that by selecting these cities, their actions will inspire others to embrace the core message of EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK \u2013 sustainable mobility is the right choice for everyone.\" The EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award showcases local authorities that demonstrate significant efforts in promoting sustainable urban mobility, while the SUMP Award recognises outstanding sustainable urban mobility planning, this year focusing on shared mobility in the planning process . \nVienna, Austria received the EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award 2017 for larger municipalities. The Austrian capital, impressed the jury with its outstanding programme of activities during EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK, which reflected a firm understanding of the theme of the 2017 campaign - Clean, shared, and intelligent mobility . Among other activities, residents of Vienna were able to rent cargo bikes free of charge, take guided walks through different city neighbourhoods, and join an urban picnic on a street previously reserved for vehicles. One initiative saw crowds positioned at busy bicycle intersections, providing cyclists with a round of applause for choosing a sustainable transport method. The city also worked with kindergartens to educate children on sustainable modes of transport. \nIgoumenitsa in Greece received the first ever EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award 2017 for smaller municipalities. The city took home the honour for exemplary work in communicating the benefits of sustainable mobility to residents, including those who live in nearby small towns. \nTurda in Romania received the 6th Award for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning for its clear planning vision, robust financing strategy, and measurable targets. The jury noted the replicability of the strategy and its potential to inspire other similarly-sized cities (Turda has a population of around 50,000 inhabitants). The jury also found that the level of ambition within the plan was high given the relatively small size of the city, particularly in the field of shared mobility. \nGreater Manchester (United Kingdom) and Milan (Italy) were fellow finalists for the 6th edition of the SUMP Award. \nFor more information on the campaign, visit www.mobilityweek.eu Country:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

the lead on problem-solving focus of Voka Congress , \u2018Everyone is an entrepreneur,\u2019 says Voka , Tour of Flanders Centre shows visitors how to race like the pros Summary \nIn the latest in a two-month case that has gripped Flanders\u2019 art community \u2013 and beyond \u2013 police in Ghent have sealed a collection of Russian avant-garde art on suspicion of forgery Museum director suspended In the latest development in the situation of 24 works of Russian avant-garde art on display at Ghent\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, judicial authorities have carried out a search of the museum, as well as the home of the owner of the collection. For months, experts have claimed that many of the artworks are fakes. \nThe owner of the works, Brussels-based art collector Igor Toporovski, has started a non-profit organisation to put the works \u2013 and more \u2013 on permanent display in the Brussels municipality of Jette. But first he loaned them to Ghent\u2019s Fine Art Museum (MSK). \nBecause of a recent spate of fakes discovered in the world of Russian modern art, international dealers took an interest in the pieces \u2013 mostly paintings but also sculpture. Several even travelled to Ghent to see them in person. The works are by pioneering artists of the period such as Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky and Vladimir Tatlin. \nIn January, 10 international dealers and curators penned an open letter, published in local media, calling into question the authenticity of \u201cnearly all\u201d of the works. The museum\u2019s director, Catherine de Zegher, said that all the paperwork for the works was in order. When questioned by city councillors, she said that the works had been examined by two experts in Russian avant-garde art before being put on display. Analysis ordered \nFlemish culture minister Sven Gatz, however, ordered an independent analysis. He assembled a team of four experts and brought them to Ghent to work together with the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage to determine whether or not the paintings and sculptures were authentic. In the meantime, the museum decided to dismantle the exhibition. \nThe day last month that the analysis was to begin, additional demands were made by Toporovski\u2019s lawyer. According to Gatz, they demanded to know why the works had been called into question. \u201cThese conditions make it impossible to get the analysis started,\u201d said Gatz. \u201cThey are a deal-breaker.\u201d \nDe Zegher told De Standaard that she was deeply disappointed that the experts could not make a determination, thereby clearing the MSK of any wrong-doing. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that it ended up this way,\u201d she said. \nIf there is no co-operation and in fact the attempt is made even more difficult, that suggests that there is a reason to be suspicious - Culture minister Sven Gatz \nGatz has now stepped away from the situation entirely. \u201cThere was a suspicion of fault here, and I wanted to act as a mediator,\u201d he told De Standaard . \u201cBut if there is no co-operation and in fact the attempt is made even more difficult, that suggests that there is a reason to be suspicious. The MSK is a city institution. I wanted to take an impartial role here, but now they\u2019re on their own.\u201d \nEarlier this month, the city council suspended De Zegher, saying that the experts who she claimed analysed the works before they were exhibited in the museum denied any such co-operation. The city has asked the director to provide proof that the experts were called in. It has also sent auditors to the museum to examine the procedures involved with curating exhibitions. \nFinally, in the latest news, this week police carried out a search of the museum, sealing the depot where the works are being stored and confiscating documents and computers. According to information obtained by De Standaard , Toporovski\u2019s home in Brussels was also searched as were two other locations not divulged by the authorities. \nAlthough judicial authorities had not been involved previously, they were forced to respond to a complaint filed by a group of four international art dealers who claim that the entire situation has disrupted the art market, affecting their business.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "voka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flanders",

thrilled to launch its S hared P ersonalised A utonomous C onnected v E hicles (SPACE) project during a kick-off meeting held Thursday, 22 March 2018 in Brussels, Belgium.The project counts on 45 participants from 18 countries, all members of UITP, who will collaborate for the duration of the project period which will last between 18 to 24 months.UITP\u2019s SPACE project aims at placing public transport at the centre of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) revolution that is emerging everywhere in the world.Led by UITP, this project will give members the right tools and knowledge to provide more efficient and better services.In his welcome speech during the event,   emphasised the importance for cities to \u201cprepare for the transition, but also that policy makers don\u2019t only look at autonomous vehicles from a technological or industry point of view, but also from a \u2018mobility\u2019 point of view\u2019\u2019.Mr Mezghani added that AVs should not only be \u201cabout introducing a new technology, but about benefiting from the technology to change our approach to mobility and our behaviours\u201d.In order to achieve this, the SPACE project will assess the impacts of automated road transport systems, develop operational concepts and new business models and it will advocate for a harmonised framework to allow AVs safe operation in real mobility scenarios.The SPACE project will be divided into four working groups covering Connected and Autonomous Mobility, Technical Reference Architecture, Observatory & Experience Monitoring and User Acceptance, Impact Assessment & Stakeholder Engagement.The findings of the project will be released in the spring of 2019.By taking the lead on such an important topic as autonomous vehicles, UITP is actively and concretely working to make the integration of autonomous vehicles in public transport a success.\"In a holistic view, it's the land use impact that determines the long-term value\", said our keynote

Single Market Food & Drink Industry celebrates 25th Anniversary of Single Market Date: LinkedIn (Brussels, 22 March 2018) As European leaders discuss progress made with regard to the EU Single Market during the European Council summit today and tomorrow (22-23 March), FoodDrinkEurope is seizing the opportunity of the Single Market\u2019s 25th Anniversary to celebrate the progress it has brought to businesses and citizens at large, at an event tonight in Brussels. \nFoodDrinkEurope also takes this opportunity to publish its Single Market Manifesto , a short overview of the benefits and outstanding challenges of the Single Market for food and drink products. \nUsing testimonies from small and large companies to demonstrate the sector\u2019s commitment to the Single Market, the Manifesto also proposes some policy recommendations to further reinforce what it sees as the most significant achievement of the European Union. \nHubert Weber, FoodDrinkEurope President and President Mondel\u0113z Europe, commented: \u201cFor the EU food and drink sector, the smooth and effective functioning of the Single Market is essential to guarantee growth, jobs and effective service to consumers. It also ensures the diversity, availability, affordability and safety of our products that consumers all across Europe are able to enjoy every day. In order to preserve and build on this, it is imperative that the EU Institutions have a long-term vision and a commitment to the Single Market for the next 25 years. With our Manifesto, we invite European and national policy-makers to reflect on the achievements of 25 years of the Single Market for food and drinks and to put the Single Market central in all food and drink policies in the future.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mondel\u0113z europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hubert weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fooddrinkeurope", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "25th anniversary of single market food & drink industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food & drink industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu single market", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:26:12.020+03:00"}], "totalResults": 26, "moreResultsAvailable": 16, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745794886&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3ABE+location%3ABrussels&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 922, "extra": {"place": "Brussels", "country": "BE", "lat": "50.8503396", "lng": "4.3517103"}}
