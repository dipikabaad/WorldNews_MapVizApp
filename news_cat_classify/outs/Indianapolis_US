Their son, U.S. Navy Radio Technician 2nd Class Clarence Donnor was missing in action, it said. \nAlthough they did not know it at the time, Donnor had been listed as aboard on the USS Indianapolis, which had been sunk by a Japanese submarine in the Philippine Sea on July 30, resulting in the largest loss of life at sea in U.S. Navy history. \nIndianapolis sank in less than 15 minutes, with some 300 sailors and Marines going down with the ship. With few lifeboats, many of the remaining faced death by exposure or shark attack until being rescued days later. \nDonnor, however, was nowhere near the disaster playing out in the Pacific. His assignment to the Indianapolis had been canceled moments before the ship deployed on a secret mission to deliver atomic bomb components to the island of Tinian, the airstrip used to launch the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead, he had received orders to report for officer training at Fort Schuyler, N.Y. \nUSS Indianapolis preparing to leave Tinian after delivering atomic bomb components, circa 26 July 1945.

The Wyoming QB was outstanding during a 60-throw workout that drew representatives from half the league's teams .\nWhile I'll be surprised if the Browns don't pick Darnold first overall in the 2018 NFL Draft , I wasn't surprised to hear Cleveland decided to send a contingent, including owner Jimmy Haslam, to Laramie, Wyo., to see Allen work out on Friday. He's my No. 4 QB in the draft, and he has a chance to be the best NFL player of this year's QB class.\nHere are my takeaways from Allen's pro-day workout.\n1) I can't remember a time when a quarterback prospect has done a better job in the offseason. Allen had a great performance in January at the Reese's Senior Bowl . He was the talk of the NFL Scouting Combine earlier this month with the athletic ability and arm strength he showed off in Indianapolis. On Friday, he had one of the better pro-day throwing sessions we'll see. He won the offseason.\n2) Allen's footwork, accuracy and touch were improved at the pro day from what we saw him from him a few weeks ago at the combine. It was clear that he and his QB coach, Jordan Palmer, wanted to focus on touch throws in this workout, and he showed well in that area. Of course, he also showed off his cannon of a right arm. He threw fastballs with ease.\n3) Allen still needs to work on anticipation. That's going to be a challenge for him because he has such a strong arm and will lock onto his first read at times, but I think he can do it if given time to develop before he's thrust into action in the NFL. That's why landing with a team that has an established starter would be the ideal scenario for him.\n4) I'm expecting four QBs to go in the top six picks next month, and I expect Allen to be in that group. Now, where he goes is still a question, but he reminded everyone on Friday of just how special he can be. He has rare arm talent, but he doesn't quite have the same touch and precision that guys like Darnold and Baker Mayfield possess. Allen has the most upside of any QB in this draft, but he also has a lower floor than some of his fellow signal-callers.\n5) One executive who's been making the rounds to the QB workouts this draft season texted me this message on Friday: \"These (pro days) are all the same to me. Let the tape and intangibles make your decision.\"\nAt the end of the day, teams have to go back to the tape and decide if they're comfortable with what they see from the QB. There's no doubt he had some rough outings against Power Five competition during his college career, but there's also no denying his upside. I see Allen making progress. He's trending up, but he's going to need time to fully realize his potential. He needs a franchise that will be patient with him. The payoff could be huge.\nFollow Daniel Jeremiah on Twitter @MoveTheSticks .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=/4595/nfl.news/story&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&cust_params=slot%3Dvideo%26url%3Dstory%26prtnr%3Dcollege-football%26s1%3Dstory&url=", "http://twitter.com/MoveTheSticks"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam darnold", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josh allen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darnold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laramie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:17:37.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06e15db63d583a72d286ba58272f8ed70039916e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGYfMwpuwsPo6yuXfYx7xPlth85QVHB1c_AAMUbq6zbbunXJRDrsiWbosMRHOXjY4OV70umkVw38egfpXw9q2alep3ks4NC4q4qbdd1FJsTHdLqVVhmIapehg--", "site_full": "www.indystar.com", "site": "indystar.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/indystar/todaystopstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "title_full": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "published": "2018-03-22T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a091bb54482b8466cb4ca5f5747706f6302849c/c=0-214-4200-2587&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/03/21/INGroup/Indianapolis/636572431296236718-MP179204-2.jpg", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 12374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 869, "comments": 2, "shares": 869}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06e15db63d583a72d286ba58272f8ed70039916e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGYfMwpuwsPo6yuXfYx7xPlth85QVHB1c_AAMUbq6zbbunXJRDrsiWbosMRHOXjY4OV70umkVw38egfpXw9q2alep3ks4NC4q4qbdd1FJsTHdLqVVhmIapehg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IndyStar", "published": "2018-03-22T13:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "text": "Activate your digital access.

Sunshine returned Wednesday in Indianapolis, and much of the snow began to melt away. But snow quickly returned to the forecast, and a new set of weather advisories suggest that snow shovels should be kept handy this weekend. Early Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a special weather message saying snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches, with localized amounts up to 8 inches, and ice accumulations of a light glaze are possible from late Friday through Saturday evening. If the forecast comes to fruition, the heavy snowfall could have an impact on planned weekend events like the IHSAA basketball state finals , and the March For Our Lives rally. \u2014 NWS Indianapolis (@NWSIndianapolis) March 22, 2018 Cities targeted in the weather warning include Indianapolis, Shelbyville, Lafayette, Kokomo, Frankfort, Muncie, Crawfordsville and Anderson. Those communities have been placed under a winter storm watch until 2 a.m. Saturday. \"A winter storm Watch means there is potential for significant snow, sleet or ice accumulations that may impact travel,\" said a NWS statement. Previously, One national weather forecaster on Wednesday estimated 8 to 12 inches for Central Indiana over the weekend. Meteorologist Tara Dudzik with the National Weather Service said there will be precipitation, but she is not expecting a foot of snow. Chances of rain arrive Friday evening, mixing with snow after 1 a.m., according to the NWS . Snow showers are expected to pick up after 4 a.m., but precipitation amounts are expected to stay between a quarter and a half inch. Snow, rain and freezing rain will continue fall Saturday, with most coming before 3 p.m. as the high temperature approaches 36 degrees. When it comes to forecasting final snowfall totals this far out, Dudzik said, it's simply too early to tell. As a storm moves through the Central Plains and into the Midwest, anything could happen. \"Even a shift of 50 miles in the track is going to be a big difference in the type of weather,\" she said Wednbesday. With several days before the system is expected to pass through Central Indiana, Dudzik said the southern half of the state is likely to see rain, but that is likely to transition to snow stretching from Lafayette to Indianapolis and beyond. \"Anywhere north of that line right now looks like more of a snow event,\" she said. Although Saturday's high is expected to reach the high 30s, there is the potential for the snow to accumulate on the roads, especially to the northeast. \"If it drops with the snow, it could cool rather quickly,\" she said. High temperatures are expected to be in the upper 40s through the end of the week, with sunshine in the forecast Thursday and Friday, according to the NWS. Rain could return to the forecast as soon as Monday evening, with a 50 percent chance of rain possible. Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156. Follow her on Twitter: @hollyvhays .

They cannot talk to us,\" Capt. Chris Major of the Indianapolis Fire Department told CBS affiliate WTTV .\nThe station recently took video of fire department crews responding to a call of an overdose. Medics found a man in the grass near a busy intersection. He was unresponsive and struggling to breathe after medics say he overdosed on the street drug called KD.\n\"Their movements are slow and lethargic, a lot of drooling and a loss of function. We find them with their clothes off, eating the grass, pulling dirt out of the ground and trying to put it in their mouth,\" Major said.\nKD is a mix of either marijuana , tobacco , or the synthetic marijuana known as Spice doused in a heavy-duty bug spray, like Raid. Users smoke the mixture.\n\"We find people passed out with it still in their hand. That is how fast it has an effect on them,\" Major said.\nHe says his team has had nearly a dozen KD overdose runs in one day, sometimes treating the same person multiple times a day.\n\"They do not know what is in this stuff or who has made it so they are all taking chance, which for some reason they are willing to do because we get the same people using over and over again,\" Major said.\nAuthorities say they are trying to find the source of the drug.\nIn a statement, Kelly M. Semrau, Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs, Communication and Sustainability at SC Johnson, which manufactures bug sprays such as Raid and OFF!, said the effects reported in recent news accounts are \"completely inaccurate.\"\n\"According to our scientific experts, exposure to the active ingredients in these products would not cause the reported effects,\" the statement reads. \"Global authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. EPA, for many decades have studied these active ingredients and they have not reported ill effects like this. Additionally, even if these active ingredients were intentionally overused, we would not expect these types of symptoms, nor would they last for 45 minutes.\"\n\"Our products are safe when used as directed,\" the company said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cbs4indy.com/2018/03/19/people-smoking-drug-laced-with-heavy-duty-bug-spray-prompts-dozens-of-overdose-calls/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris major of", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wttv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the indianapolis fire department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T23:27:49.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b909cc8daacf0973a786d2f19d6d1a601810360", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGY0agGdVmHPyAVJ3b201Xa3FQn6PnR93HVmkW67cYa2o9397fWocmh6S0_363xdBuX4_zx2JztNypzQ5Xfb2FmGLwhsGiH2ZbOizEnZQMa0RreERPCfrO4KFqobZtux2JA", "site_full": "www.indystar.com", "site": "indystar.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/indystar/colts", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "Why ESPN ranked Peyton Manning 17 places ahead of Tom Brady", "title_full": "Why ESPN ranked Peyton Manning 17 places ahead of Tom Brady", "published": "2018-03-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b2b76c6186ce5a598b404c72235ae58ae0b2246/c=120-0-3092-1679&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/03/21/INGroup/Indianapolis/636572346767101311-636428958548581123-27-colts16.172163.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 12374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 630, "comments": 2, "shares": 630}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b909cc8daacf0973a786d2f19d6d1a601810360", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGY0agGdVmHPyAVJ3b201Xa3FQn6PnR93HVmkW67cYa2o9397fWocmh6S0_363xdBuX4_zx2JztNypzQ5Xfb2FmGLwhsGiH2ZbOizEnZQMa0RreERPCfrO4KFqobZtux2JA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dwight.adams@indystar.com", "published": "2018-03-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why ESPN ranked Peyton Manning 17 places ahead of Tom Brady", "text": "Posted!

They cannot talk to us,\" Capt. Chris Major of the Indianapolis Fire Department told CBS affiliate WTTV .\nThe station recently took video of fire department crews responding to a call of an overdose. Medics found a man in the grass near a busy intersection. He was unresponsive and struggling to breathe after medics say he overdosed on the street drug called KD.\n\"Their movements are slow and lethargic, a lot of drooling and a loss of function. We find them with their clothes off, eating the grass, pulling dirt out of the ground and trying to put it in their mouth,\" Major said.\nKD is a mix of either marijuana , tobacco , or the  synthetic marijuana known as Spice doused in a heavy-duty bug spray, like Raid. Users smoke the mixture.\n\"We find people passed out with it still in their hand. That is how fast it has an effect on them,\" Major said.\nHe says his team has had nearly a dozen KD overdose runs in one day, sometimes treating the same person multiple times a day.\n\"They do not know what is in this stuff or who has made it so they are all taking chance, which for some reason they are willing to do because we get the same people using over and over again,\" Major said.\nAuthorities say they are trying to find the source of the drug.\nIn a statement, Kelly M. Semrau, Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs, Communication and Sustainability at SC Johnson, which manufactures bug sprays such as Raid and OFF!, said the effects reported in recent news accounts are \"completely inaccurate.\"\n\"According to our scientific experts, exposure to the active ingredients in these products would not cause the reported effects,\" the statement reads. \"Global authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. EPA, for many decades have studied these active ingredients and they have not reported ill effects like this.

Jenna Watson/IndyStar Buy Photo The March for Our Lives rally will be held inside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday, March 24, 2018. (Photo: IndyStar 2004 file photo) Buy Photo CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2014 Organizers of the March for Our Lives rally in Indianapolis have moved the event inside the Statehouse due to weather, according to Fox59 reporter Aishah Hasnie. Organizers said the Statehouse can hold up to 6,000 people and they hope to pack the building Saturday. One of the youngest students helping to plan the event is 15-year-old Isabella Fallahi, a freshman at Carmel High School. She will be one of the speakers at Saturday\u2019s event. Having a dialogue: What happens when a black teen and a white police chief talk about police brutality? Students will ask legislators to pass policies aimed at preventing school shootings. For Fallahi, the national movement may have started in Parkland, Fla., but it hit home when threats targeted Carmel High School. Although authorities eventually found no real threat to students, she remembers how scared her classmates were. \u201cThis girl starts breaking down crying, she\u2019s like \u2018Please close the door. Someone close the door.\u2019 Like, why are we worrying about this?\u201d asked Fallahi. \u201cWe\u2019re rallying together and we\u2019re going to make a statement that we\u2019ve had enough.\u201d She hoped others will come out in support, despite the forecasted weather. She wanted everyone to know how personal this cause is for Hoosier students. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional,\u201d said Fallahi. \u201cYou need to come out here and show your legislators that you want action. You don't want to be living in fear.\u201d The march begins Saturday at 11 a.m.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aishah hasnie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabella fallahi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon warren", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "statehouse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warren central", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmel high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "statehouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ind.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana statehouse", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:51:46.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23a88c164447c5632c3a8cfaea77cf42f69e8481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnGLe3PSuVMeKAMrEVj357jV5Kc.01vEPT3StRDDE3C6Pgp12fDkiOJgrWzg9GS5eTK_Cgwju2E.cAWXHlLfC6xPPoF0ikPP.4Tt6KUqBcnmR5Tsp0ZSOKlSv.1x8OBzC2kF7affpNVmDbNGVKc4YAQ6tfCr35ckNlmTZchk0lT6k6qCRmDqx3", "site_full": "247sports.com", "site": "247sports.com", "site_section": "http://tennessee.247sports.com/Page/Tennessee-Football-Recruiting-100036/Headlines.rss", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "GoVols247 Tennessee Home News", "title": "Pruitt updates the status of Vols' LB Kirkland", "title_full": "Pruitt updates the status of Vols' LB Kirkland", "published": "2018-03-24T22:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/384/868/26_7868384.JPG", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 2230, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 326, "comments": 0, "shares": 326}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23a88c164447c5632c3a8cfaea77cf42f69e8481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnGLe3PSuVMeKAMrEVj357jV5Kc.01vEPT3StRDDE3C6Pgp12fDkiOJgrWzg9GS5eTK_Cgwju2E.cAWXHlLfC6xPPoF0ikPP.4Tt6KUqBcnmR5Tsp0ZSOKlSv.1x8OBzC2kF7affpNVmDbNGVKc4YAQ6tfCr35ckNlmTZchk0lT6k6qCRmDqx3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T22:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pruitt updates the status of Vols' LB Kirkland", "text": "Slot to Tennessee Links Darrin Kirkland Jr. has missed the first week of Tennessee's spring practices, but his absence only will be temporary. The rising redshirt junior linebacker, who missed the entire 2017 season after tearing his meniscus in August, could return later in the spring after undergoing a minor procedure to clean up his knee. New Vols coach Jeremy Pruitt after Saturday's practice said Kirkland needed to have his knee \"cleaned up\" and provided a potential timetable for his return to the practice field. (Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Darrin Kirkland Jr. (Photo: Wes Rucker, 247Sports) \"He might even finish up and get to go the last couple of practices of spring.\" A former four-star recruit out of Indianapolis, Kirkland burst onto the scene as a freshman in 2015 and became Tennessee's starting middle linebacker early in the season. He wound up finishing with the fourth-most tackles by a freshman in program history and earned SEC All-Freshman team honors. Since then, though, his career has been marred by injuries. Kirkland tore multiple ligaments in his ankle in the second game of the 2016 season, and though he returned after missing just five games, he wasn't 100 percent healthy and struggled to close the regular season before a strong showing in the Music City Bowl. He was set to man the middle of Tennessee's defense last season before going down less than two weeks before the season opener. The Vols were hoping to have him back by the spring, but their wait will go on just a little longer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pruitt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darrin kirkland jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wes rucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darrin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy pruitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new vols", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:57:55.015+03:00"}], "totalResults": 897, "moreResultsAvailable": 887, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745630026&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AUS+location%3AIndianapolis&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 938, "extra": {"place": "Indianapolis", "country": "US", "lat": "39.768403", "lng": "-86.158068"}}
