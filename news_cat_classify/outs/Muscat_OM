Oman has been providing rapid molecular testing for those suspected with TB, which coincides with the World Tuberculosis Day, which is observed on March 24 every year. On this day in 1882, Dr Robert Koch announced he had discovered the bacterium that causes TB, paving the way for diagnosing/ treating of the disease. The theme of this year\u2019s Tuberculosis Day, \u2018Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world\u2019, focuses on building commitment to end TB at all levels, governmental and community. The day provides an opportunity to shine the spotlight on the disease, and its prevention and treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers TB, besides HIV/AIDS, as the main causes of death due to communicable diseases. Globally, an estimated 10.4 million people fell ill with TB in 2016, of which 1.8 million died. According to WHO, Oman is a \u2018low incidence country\u2019 with less than 10/100,000 population (5.8/100,000 in 2017) with TB, with an average reduction rate of two per cent in the last ten years. In order to reduce its incidence and mortality, Oman has developed a strategy for TB elimination by 2050, which is being implemented in phases.

Dr Khaled bin Salem al Saidi, Secretary-General, appreciated the efforts exerted by the Organisational Evaluation Committee and the conclusions arrived at pertaining to the development of KPI for the Council. It will involve review of job descriptions and the terms of reference of the administrative divisions of the Council, thereby ensuring complementarity in functioning and avoid duplication. In course of honouring the Committee members, he said that the Council\u2019s interest in the Organisational Evaluation process was based on the conviction that it is important to find precise Key Indicators to measure the performance of the staff in order to achieve the desired objectives. The report, documented by the Organisational Evaluation Committee of the Council, will lead to the establishment of the vision and mission for formulating requisite proposals for the development of the Council\u2019s KPI process. He affirmed that an organisational performance evaluation is an integrated and systematic process for obtaining valid information about the performance of individuals within their departments and the performance of these departments within the overall policies of the Council and their impact on the overall performance of the Council. He expressed his satisfaction over the process of evaluation of staff, department and organisational performance, which sought to refine the standards of achievement in the light of the objectives envisaged, ensuring the efficient and effective use of resources to achieve those objectives. He was pleased to see that the Council\u2019s Evaluation Committee had worked to formulate a vision for the Council to consolidate the shura, which was rooted in the values and culture of society, keeping abreast of the developments enabled by changing times and supporting the development path. The panel recommendations would be utilised and applied to help develop the work of the Council during the next phase.
