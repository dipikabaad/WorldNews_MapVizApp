Deontay Wilder where you at? June - let's go,\" he said afterwards. \nBrowne was treated by ringside medics. \nWhyte had vowed to make his opponent bleed and did so in the first round, opening up a cut under the 38-year-old's left eye that worsened as the fight progressed. \nWhyte was totally in control and had former nightclub bouncer Browne, who briefly tried to rally in the third, in trouble throughout with his jab speed and powerful right hand. \nIt was a left hook that ended the contest and resulted in Browne needing treatment, before eventually getting back to his feet to walk out of the ring after the stoppage. \nHe was taken to hospital as a precaution. \nWhyte, who is ranked number one by the WBC, remains the prime contender for a potentially lucrative contest against that organisation's high-profile champion Wilder. \nWilder, however, will be ringside at Joshua's fight with Joseph Parker next week, and could try to pursue a huge unification fight with the winner of that bout. Whyte found plenty of success with his right and ended the bout with a powerful left hook \nFellow heavyweight Tony Bellew said he was relieved Browne, who appeared slow and cumbersome from the second round onwards, was able to walk away. \n\"I'm just happy Browne has left the ring himself and not on a stretcher,\" he tweeted. \"Whyte has announced himself on the world scene. Browne is usually an extremely durable man. Wasn't tonight.\" \nWhyte said the win proved he can win a world title. \n\"Hopefully he's OK, he showed up and tried,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I proved I'm world class. My training paid off. I'm a good fighter but people haven't seen it yet. \n\"I need the challenge there. Lucas Browne thought his power was incredible. I might not have 22 knockouts but I can crack. \n\"When people stand in front of me it's a different story. I'm going to lay all of these guys out one by one. \n\"If Wilder fights anyone else I'm going to go to America and kick off. I just want to fight.\" \nWhyte had weighed in at 18st 2lbs 2oz, almost eight pounds heavier than when he outpointed British heavyweight Dereck Chisora in a notable 2016 victory, but still lighter than the 18st 11lbs 22oz Browne. Derek Chisora also had an early win in another decisive heavyweight fight \nEarlier on Saturday's undercard, Chisora stopped Frenchman Zakaria Azzouzi with a fierce right hand in the second round. \nChisora, 34, then demanded old rival David Haye put his purse with Bellew on the line in order for him to agree to a fight with Joe Joyce, whom Haye promotes. \n\"I'll make a deal with you right now: if he beats me you write me a cheque of \u00a31, if I beat him you give me your purse against Tony and your TV rights,\" said Chisora. \nHaye declined the offer. \nAlso on the undercard, Lewis Ritson successfully defended his British lightweight title with a second-round win against former champion Scotty Cardle. \nAnd Commonwealth light-heavyweight champion Callum Johnson added the British belt to his collection by beating Frank Buglioni by technical knockout in the first round.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lucas browne", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dillian whyte", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "whyte", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "browne", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deontay wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony joshua", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T02:17:37.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "336d5eaab04c89b4dd9dcceec850e13130c06ef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNMkchhcOVhynU3PuH_Hcs0ZE4dDORHzsOi1lfO1UaSysU3hPnaq8bpdJG9Z39cLWcHgg5Vb6gKaFPc_n.RRDVpTh7.p5o53I-", "site_full": "www.mirror.co.uk", "site": "mirror.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "mirror - Home", "title": "Mile End shooting: Two men in hospital after being blasted outside Tube station in latest London violence", "title_full": "Mile End shooting: Two men in hospital after being blasted outside Tube station in latest London violence", "published": "2018-03-24T08:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12243801.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Mile-End-shooting.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 804, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2980, "comments": 0, "shares": 2980}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "336d5eaab04c89b4dd9dcceec850e13130c06ef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNMkchhcOVhynU3PuH_Hcs0ZE4dDORHzsOi1lfO1UaSysU3hPnaq8bpdJG9Z39cLWcHgg5Vb6gKaFPc_n.RRDVpTh7.p5o53I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Robson", "published": "2018-03-24T08:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mile End shooting: Two men in hospital after being blasted outside Tube station in latest London violence", "text": "    \nTwo men are in hospital after being shot outside a Tube station. \nThe latest violence to hit London happened outside Mile End Underground station at around 10.35pm on Friday night. \nEyewitnesses reported a major police response, including firearms officers, after gunshots were heard. \nPolice found two men aged in their 20s with gunshot wounds. \nThey were taken by ambulance to an east London hospital where they remain in a stable condition. \nTheir injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. \nThe Met said their anti-gang unit Trident is leading the investigation.

They include Vishal Vora, who has quit London for Berlin and says \u201cBritain really seems broken now\u201d, and Liz and Gary Trow, who have relocated to France, saying that their daughter is enjoying a more multicultural environment.\nSome of the escapees have been setting up their own businesses, while others have managed to secure equivalent or even better jobs. And some have used this as a chance to make a career switch. And, rather than isolating themselves in the traditional expat enclaves, many are keen to embrace the local communities in their host countries.\nIn the week it was announced that the UK and EU have reached an agreement on a Brexit transition deal , Guardian Money spoke to three families who have upped sticks about how difficult it was to make the move and how they are coping.\n\u2018For an academic Britain is finished\u2019 Vishal Vora is happy to describe himself as a Brexit refugee. The 37-year-old says that \u201cfor an academic, Britain is finished\u201d so, following the June 2016 vote, he and his family decided to emigrate.\nHe is a legal academic and his wife, Abbie, is a magazine journalist. They have three children: Ramona, five, Grayson, two, and baby Margot, who is two months old.\nVora got a research fellowship in Germany and the family moved to Berlin last autumn. They have swapped their former home in Stoke Newington, north London \u2013 where they were \u201cliving like Victorians, four of us in a tiny one-bedroom flat ... many people wondered how we managed\u201d \u2013 for a beautiful and spacious \u201caltbau\u201d (old-build) flat in the centre of the German capital.\nHe adds: \u201cMy salary is \u20ac51,000 (\u00a344,500). We rent a 122 sq metre three-bedroom flat in the city centre with tenure for life, and the \u20ac1,835 (\u00a31,600) a month rent includes heating, water and housekeeping. The only extra is electricity, which is around \u20ac50 (\u00a344) a month. By contrast, my monthly mortgage payments on my 27 sq metre flat in London are \u00a31,000.\u201d\nI wanted to give my children the best start and for the basic stuff \u2013 housing, education and healthcare \u2013 to be sorted\nMeanwhile, the couple\u2019s children are in free full-time kindergarten, which Vora says would have cost \u00a31,800 a month in London. They have traded a car for a family cargo bike. Vora works outside Berlin and pays \u20ac400 (\u00a3350) a month on train fares. The family reckon food is pricier in Berlin but of better quality.\nVora says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be fair to blame Brexit entirely for our decision to leave the UK, though it played a big part. The problems in this country stem from what happened in Thatcher\u2019s reign: selling housing stock and not replacing it and privatising public services.\n\u201cThe UK has been neglected for decades and it shows: public transport is a joke, the NHS is falling to pieces, the education system is broken. I wanted to give my children the best start in life and I wanted the basic stuff \u2013 housing, education and healthcare \u2013 to be sorted. I feel in a country like Germany, this stuff \u2013 basic human rights, perhaps, in the western world \u2013 is sorted and doesn\u2019t cause me sleepless nights.\u201d\nAs a consequence, the difference between their lives in London and Berlin \u201cis as clear as night and day. Although we rent here, this isn\u2019t seen as a failure: 83% of the population rents with secure tenure. It\u2019s a contract for life, should we choose to stay here.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cFull-time childcare is free and medical care is superb \u2013 my wife gave birth to our third child here eight weeks ago. She was able to stay in hospital for four days, we never felt pressured to go home and they provided everything for the baby. We had two other children in London at a top teaching hospital, and the difference was huge. My wife was basically asked to leave within 12 hours of giving birth.\u201d\nVora is a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, which is funding his post-doctoral research into the role of legal identity among British Hindus, while Abbie gave up her permanent job in the UK to allow him to take this position. \u201cShe will begin freelancing in the next 12 months or so, but at the moment is enjoying being a full-time mother of three,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI visit London often for work and it will always be home, but with great regret, until the basic stuff is sorted \u2013 which won\u2019t happen in my lifetime \u2013 I don\u2019t see myself moving back. I value quality of life far too much to ask my family to put up with all of the above just to live in London. Things are going to get worse for the UK before they begin to get better.\u201d\n\u2018I had no connection here any more\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liz and Gary Trow have moved to France with their 12-year-old daughter.\nLiz, 35, and Gary Trow, 40, made the decision to start a new life in France with their daughter, Lara, 12, soon after the referendum.\nUncomfortable with the result, the couple felt they were in a minority in the Dorset coastal town of Poole, where there was a higher-than-average vote in favour of leaving the EU (58.2% versus 51.9% for the UK as a whole).\n\u201cI\u2019m worried it makes the UK seem unwelcoming to people from other countries,\u201d says Liz. \u201cAs an accountant I can see this affecting the stability of small businesses who rely on a continuous supply of European employees.\nIt\u2019s such a wonderful way to bring a child up - it\u2019s so different to what we were doing in the UK\n\u201cWith my grandad passing away, I felt I had no real connection or need to be here any more. No one was depending on us \u2013 it just felt like this is the time to do it.\u201d\nThe couple sold their house in Poole and bought a farmhouse and gite in the Loire valley, leaving the UK in March 2017. They relaunched Les Vigeants as a triathlon holiday centre and hosted their first guests last May.\nHaving come from an area where the majority of the population are white British (88%, according to 2011 census data for Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch), the couple are happy that their daughter is growing up in a more multicultural environment. \u201cThe children round here are fluent in English and they are fluent in French, and have Dutch friends as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a wonderful way to bring a child up \u2013 it\u2019s so different to what we were doing in the UK.\u201d\n\u2018A kneejerk reaction after the vote\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Terence Sheehan and his partner, Emma Holmes, now live in Alicante, Spain.\nTerence Sheehan, 51, and his partner Emma Holmes, 44, both from marketing backgrounds, have been taking Spanish evening classes to demonstrate their commitment to their new homeland since moving to Alicante in Spain, from Chiswick, west London, in June 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s respectful to learn Spanish and be seen to be at least attempt to pick up the language as quickly as you can,\u201d says Sheehan.\n\u201cWe are here not to just kind of mix with the expat community \u2013 we\u2019re here to mix with the Spanish community as well.\u201d\nHe adds that rather than deter them, the Brexit vote acted as a catalyst for the couple to follow through with plans to move to Spain.\nIt made us determined to make that move and to make sure everything worked out for us\n\u201cIt made us determined to make that move and to make sure everything worked out for us, which it has. It was almost a kneejerk reaction when we heard the result \u2013 just to get on with it and do our best. I still can\u2019t believe the way the vote panned out. I\u2019m a European first and foremost.\u201d\nSheehan says the property management company that they have set up, Holmes & Co, started \u201calmost by accident\u201d after a contact of a neighbour in Alicante asked for his help to market a holiday villa. \u201cOne property led to another, and we now look after about 10,\u201d he says.\nSheehan says expats are locked in a guessing game over the Brexit negotiations.\n\u201cPeople are concerned about the impact on their lives and how it will affect them in terms of healthcare, the exchange rate \u2013 will they get the same value for their money? Is the pound going to weaken?\u201d\nHe adds that there is also growing unease among retirees over whether UK pensions are going to be affected.\n\u201cAlso, when we leave the EU, expats are thinking about applying for Spanish citizenship because that will allow them to have the same benefits,\u201d he says.\n\u201cApril 2019\u2019s going to be interesting. But I can\u2019t see too much happening in terms of there being a dramatic change for everyone \u2013 there\u2019s just too much to lose for the Spanish and for the British government.\u201d\n\u2018We lost \u00a350,000 overnight\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan and Julie Barber have turned their home in Portugal into a bed and breakfast.\nAlan Barber couldn\u2019t believe the referendum result. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure Brexit will happen. To me it made no sense at all,\u201d he says.\nBarber, 61, and his wife, Julia, 57, arranged the completion of their house sale for the day after the vote. They had planned to transfer the proceeds into euros to fund their new life in Castelo Branco, Portugal. But after the vote, the pound fell to its lowest level in 31 years.\nYou can almost see the stress leaving you when you get here\n\u201cWe lost \u00a350,000 overnight,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhen we went to bed, the pound was quite high because everyone forecast that we were staying in, and when we woke up it had gone through the floor.\u201d\nEven worse, a week later and the day before they were to fly out to Portugal, the owner of the house the couple were buying found out they were from the UK and put the price up beyond their means.\n\u201cSo that house fell through and we said to the agent in Portugal: \u2018We\u2019re leaving, we\u2019re on our way, you need to find us something.\u2019 So he found us two schist stone houses, which are in a stunning location \u2013 better than the first one.\u201d\nWith the loss on the exchange rate and higher than anticipated costs on the replacement property, the couple converted their new home into a bed and breakfast.\nIn a nod to their Gaelic roots, Barber called the B&B Casa Tus Nua, which means \u201cthe house of new beginnings\u201d in Irish. \u201cBut in Portuguese it\u2019s the \u2018house of the naked women\u2019, so all the neighbours thought we were opening a brothel,\u201d Barber says.

between Australia and London, passing a major milestone by reducing to 17 hours a trip that once took 12 1/2 days. \nThe 9,000-mile flight from Perth, one of the world\u2019s most isolated cities, marks the first direct passenger service between the continents . \nQantas Airways' inaugural service between the Australian city of Perth and Heathrow took off on Saturday evening and will touch down in London at 5.05am on Sunday before departing for the return trip at 1.15pm that afternoon. \nPassengers will be on board the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft for 17 hours as they make the 9,009-mile journey. \nThis is 24% further than the UK's existing longest route of 7,275 miles, operated by Garuda Indonesia between Heathrow and Jakarta. \nT he new link with Perth will be around three hours quicker than routes which involve stopping in the Middle East to change planes or refuel. \nIt will also enable faster journeys to Sydney and Melbourne than flying via Dubai. \nThe new link is part of Qantas' ambitious plans, unveiled over the past two years, to add ultra long-haul flights to its global schedules. \nThis will eventually include non-stop flights from Australia's eastern seaboard to Europe in an effort dubbed \"Project Sunrise\". \nQ antas chief executive Alan Joyce last year said such flights were \"the last frontier of global aviation ... the antidote to the tyranny of distance and a revolution for air travel in Australia\". \nTravel firm Flight Centre has recorded \"high demand\" for the new Qantas flights . \nIts head of aviation, Justin Penny, said: \"Flight Centre definitely feels that long-term the new route is viable and we will see additional services being launched from Europe to Australia in the coming years.\" Top 10 | The world\u2019s longest flights \nL isa Norman, the flight's captain, said \"we have been working towards (this) for the past three years and it\u2019s very exciting\u201d. \n\u201cWhen I joined Qantas not in my wildest imagination would I have thought this possible,\u201d she told the West Australian . \nCapt. Norman says she will be \u201cabsolutely exhilarated\u201d when the plane touches down in London. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a painter puts the final brush stroke on the work.\u201d Alan Joyce checks in for the first Perth to London direct flight.

The sector also supports financial-services firms such as Hartleys Ltd., whose Perth-based director of corporate finance Steve Kite is booked on Sunday\u2019s flight -- the second in the new service to London -- for just a four-day trip. \n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively an overnight flight for me and that feels like I\u2019m saving a lot of time,\u201d Mr Kite said. \nN ot everyone is convinced of the route\u2019s commercial future. \nAircraft leaving Perth for London will need feeder passengers from around Australia, said Volodymyr Bilotkach, author of the book \u201cThe Economics of Airlines.\u201d But flying from Sydney to London via Perth saves little time over a transfer in Asia or the Gulf, he said.

Opting for Singapore Airlines via Singapore would take an extra 2 1/2 hours but cost just A$4,843 (\u00a32,600), according to fares on Webjet. \nQantas has challenged Boeing and Airbus to build a jet by 2022 that can fly fully loaded from Sydney to London without a break. Success on the Perth-London service would lay the foundations for even longer routes to Europe. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really just the beginning,\u201d said Merkert at the University of Sydney.

Mindy Kaling, who is in the film, described DuVernay as a \u201cmovement\u201d, and Time magazine wrote about how the movie will change Hollywood.\nReviews suggest the film is dreadful. It has a 40% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes . The Guardian\u2019s Amy Nicholson gave it two stars , and one of those stars was purely for what Oprah did to her eyebrows. I can feel you getting annoyed with me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Romesh, are you against diversity? Are you delighted that the patriarchy has been reinforced by the failure of a film with a female protagonist?\u201d Well, no.\nBefore A Wrinkle In Time came out, you would be hard pushed to find anybody to describe at length what it was about. All the press centred on how great it was to have a female director of colour, to have a female protagonist of colour and how DuVernay \u201cwasn\u2019t just casting actresses\u201d but \u201cleaders \u2013 icons\u201d. I\u2019m not suggesting any of this is bad, by the way. This is obviously long overdue. But why does everyone have to bang on about it so much?\nTrumpeting diversity undermines what you are trying to achieve in the first place. It should happen without fanfare. There are people who are opposed to this sort of thing, and so when a film wears diversity on its sleeve, and then falls short, they throw up their hands and say things like: \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t do things based on merit\u201d and, \u201cDo you remember the good old days when black characters were played by white blokes?\u201d Nobody wants these people to be happy. These people should be presented with diverse films and not told this is part of \u201ca movement\u201d. This is just how it is.\nHow did I handle casual racism in Los Angeles? Awkwardly | Romesh Ranganathan Read more\nMaybe I\u2019m being unfair. DuVernay probably did not want to focus on these aspects of the film, but that was all she was asked about. And there\u2019s something distasteful about me ignoring all the struggles she will have had as a black female director in Hollywood as I focus on how the film is being promoted. But I do think we all have a responsibility to push the discussion of these sorts of films away from \u201ca cause\u201d.\nA recent Kermode and Mayo podcast featured a listener who had written to say they had found Black Panther a bit boring, and hoped that its shortcomings did not remove Hollywood\u2019s appetite for films with a black superhero at the fore. You what, mate? I remember being chased out of school by bullies throwing eggs. I ran to where my mum was waiting. She flipped out and started battering the bullies with her handbag. For two weeks, everyone called me Mummy\u2019s boy and the girl I was going out with split up with me because she couldn\u2019t take the embarrassment. That fortnight was more fun than watching Batman v Superman, but I don\u2019t remember anyone saying that movie was going to undermine the future of films with white men saving the world.\nBlack Panther is a great film . It has the most compelling villain of any Marvel movie, and it deals admirably with the issue of diminishing jeopardy in a million superhero films where the world is going to end. It also has an almost completely black cast and some kick-ass female characters. It deserves to be judged on its own merits. We should not be talking about this film as a giant leap forward for movie-making; we should be talking about it as one of the most exciting Marvel films for a while. I would also argue that a film set in Africa having a lot of black characters in it should probably be a given, and also that Wesley Snipes must be bloody furious that everyone\u2019s forgotten about Blade .\nGhostbusters is another example. After it was announced the \u2019Busters would all be women, breaking all stereotypical traditions from the original film except for the one with the underwritten one-dimensional black character (\u201cYou guys are really smart about this science stuff, but I know New York and can borrow a car from my uncle!\u201d), the internet cracked under the pressure of a million fanboys expressing disdain from their mum\u2019s basement. The director, Paul Feig, was forced to defend these decisions and the film became a cause, with some reviewers scared to criticise it. It underperformed at the box office and the unfortunate consequence is that a load of internet losers think they\u2019ve been proved right. You can find them now campaigning for the destruction of every copy of The Last Jedi .\nAnnouncing a diversity initiative, or making it a cause, exerts unwanted pressure. This is not restricted to movies. When the BBC\u2019s then director of television, Danny Cohen, announced that it would put at least one woman on every panel show , this made the job of every woman on a panel show more difficult. All three of them were livid. In short, we should all be pushing to make more diverse films, TV shows and business opportunities. But we probably shouldn\u2019t mention it.\nTopics A Wrinkle in Time Ava DuVernay Women features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duvernay", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amy nicholson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mindy kaling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romesh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T13:02:12.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed1a0076b07bd873a2995e18267c9e348c6b6a2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvY63Wnjr1GIZfDjkla8fkCQ--", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.bbc.com/news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Home - BBC News", "title": "Cambridge Analytica offices searched over data storage", "title_full": "Cambridge Analytica offices searched over data storage - BBC News", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14946/production/_100549248_ico.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2769, "comments": 0, "shares": 2769}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 12}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "ed1a0076b07bd873a2995e18267c9e348c6b6a2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvY63Wnjr1GIZfDjkla8fkCQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bbc.co.uk", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cambridge Analytica offices searched over data storage", "text": "Image copyright PA Image caption ICO officials were seen searching the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica The London offices of Cambridge Analytica have been searched by enforcement officers from the UK's information commissioner.\nThe High Court granted the data watchdog a warrant amid claims the firm amassed information about millions of people without their consent, based on a 2014 quiz on Facebook.\nThe seven-hour search finished in the early hours of Saturday.\nBoth Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing.\nA group of people, some wearing ICO enforcement jackets, entered the building housing Cambridge Analytica's London headquarters at 20:00 GMT on Friday - less than an hour after a High Court judge granted the warrant.\nSeveral hours later members of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) were seen leaving the offices and a van - thought to be carrying gathered evidence - was driven away from the rear of the building.\nThe ICO applied for the warrant to access the databases and servers of Cambridge Analytica.\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The search of the London building continued into the early hours of Saturday The search is part of a wider investigation into political campaigning.\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in \"an unauthorised way\", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when it found out about the loss of the data.\nCambridge Analytica's acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, said the company has been in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) since February 2017 and it remained committed to helping the investigation.\nCambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Elon Musk pulls brands from Facebook In a statement , he said checks in 2015 showed all the Facebook data had been deleted but the company was now undertaking an independent third-party audit to verify none remained.\nCambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far Claims over whether Cambridge Analytica used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum have also been raised.\nThe company denies any of the data harvested in the 2014 Facebook quiz created by an academic was used in its work for Donald Trump's campaign.\nMeanwhile, the director of Vote Leave has denied allegations of links between his campaign and Cambridge Analytica.

What's it like flying for 17 hours in economy? \nSingapore Airlines abandoned its previous flight to New York after deciding that 19 hours was too much to tolerate in economy. A move to convert the entire aircraft into business class was not financially sustainable. \nNow experts are looking at ways to minimise the toll that long-haul flights can have on passengers in economy. \nProf Steve Simpson, from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, works with Qantas to study the impact of such a long flight on the human body. He describes it a test of human endurance. \n\"Your circadian rhythm takes cues off food and light, and this flight disrupts it,\" he said.

Have an early lunch at [the airport], maybe at 10am,\" he said. \n\"The first meal on the plane becomes dinner.
