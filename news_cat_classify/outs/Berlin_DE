Das ist ein sehr ermutigendes Signal\", kommentierte Haus & Grund-Pr\u00e4sident Kai Warnecke die heutige Regierungserkl\u00e4rung von Bauminister Horst Seehofer und die daran anschlie\u00dfende Debatte im Bundestag. Er ermunterte die Gro\u00dfe Koalition, parallel den Mietwohnungsmarkt in den Fokus zu nehmen und zukunftsgerichtet weiterzuentwickeln. Haus & Grund wies darauf hin, dass der Erwerb von Wohneigentum die Mietwohnungsm\u00e4rkte entlaste. Wohneigentum sei zudem die beste Vorsorge f\u00fcr das Alter. Da jedoch viele B\u00fcrger die Mietwohnung den eigenen vier W\u00e4nden vorz\u00f6gen, seien ebenso Ma\u00dfnahmen zu ergreifen, um Mietwohnungen zukunftsf\u00e4hig zu halten. Verbandspr\u00e4sident Warnecke forderte die Bundesregierung auf, die folgenden Punkte z\u00fcgig anzugehen: 1. Erwerb von Wohneigentum effektiv f\u00f6rdern: S\u00e4mtliche im Koalitionsvertrag verabredeten Ma\u00dfnahmen m\u00fcssen z\u00fcgig umgesetzt werden. 2. Erwerbsnebenkosten senken: Es ist Aufgabe von Bund und L\u00e4ndern, gemeinsam eine Senkung der Grunderwerbsteuer anzupacken. Steuersenkungen d\u00fcrfen nicht zu einer Utopie verkommen. 3. Modernisierungen erleichtern: Kleine Modernisierungen von Mietwohnungen mit einem Investitionsvolumen von bis zu 10.000 Euro je Wohnung m\u00fcssen k\u00fcnftig unb\u00fcrokratisch umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. 4. KfW-F\u00f6rderung st\u00e4rken: Die KfW-F\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr das altersgerechte Umbauen von H\u00e4usern und Wohnungen muss langfristig gesichert werden. 5. Mietpreisbremse abschaffen: Die Mietpreisbremse ist gescheitert. Statt den Mietwohnungsmarkt immer weiter zu regulieren, sollten die B\u00fcrger ermutigt werden, Wohneigentum nicht nur zur Selbstnutzung zu erwerben, sondern auch, um es zu vermieten. Haus & Grund ist mit rund 900.000 Mitgliedern der mit Abstand gr\u00f6\u00dfte Vertreter der privaten Haus-, Wohnungs- und Grundeigent\u00fcmer in Deutschland. Den Zentralverband mit Sitz in Berlin tragen 22 Landesverb\u00e4nde und \u00fcber 900 Ortsvereine. Die privaten Immobilieneigent\u00fcmer verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber 80,6 Prozent aller Wohnungen in Deutschland. Sie bieten 66 Prozent der Mietwohnungen und knapp 30 Prozent aller Sozialwohnungen an. Sie stehen zudem f\u00fcr 76 Prozent des Neubaus von Mehrfamilienh\u00e4usern.

The Catalan is one of the most solid openings for White. It forms part of the large and strong fianchetto family in which White builds his strategy mainly around the bishop on g2. The current DVD covers all of Black\u2019s replies to the Catalan, some of which can even transpose to other openings such as the Tarrasch System and the Queen\u2019s Indian. The author\u2019s idea is, as it was in previous DVDs he has published in this area, to help White against all classical setups for Black. Though the DVD is aimed at players of the white pieces, it still might be useful for those who have Black so that they will better understand the coming threats. It would make little sense to mention all the strong players who include the Catalan in their repertoire. Suffice it to say that the Catalan rules! Video running time: 5 hours 29 minutes. GM Daniel King also takes a crack at it for his Power Play Chess channel Kramnik 1-0 Aronian \nVladimir Kramnik had a lot of plans for this tournament \u2014 you could see that easily from his furious start. As the fortunate beneficiary of the wild card, he received a fresh chance to vie for the highest title once more. But his enterprising play has ended in catastrophe one too many times, and Kramnik's win today is but cold comfort.

The new Executive MBA/MPA is a two-year program and will be taught jointly by the two universities at the Doha Institute\u2019s campus in Qatar. \nThe program, held in English, provides experienced leaders from private, public, and non-profit sectors the opportunity to develop their management skills across all of these areas. While leading universities in the U.S. have been increasingly forging such alliances, this is the first time such a program has come to the Middle East. The program builds on the Qatar National Vision 2030, which seeks to diversify the economy by enhancing the private sector, thus encouraging and maintaining its competitiveness. This results in greater interaction between the public and private sectors and the need for professionals with the skills, knowledge, and flexibility to work and lead in either sector. Graduates from the program will be equipped with sound theoretical knowledge and expertise as well as advanced analytical and management skills. They are expected to hold leadership positions at the interface of business and governance. \u201cIn an increasingly interdependent world, we need responsible managers who can lead effectively at the interface between politics, business, and society. We are delighted to be the first to bring this exceptional dual degree to the Middle East. It combines the profound expertise and knowledge of our two highly recognized universities,\u201d said ESMT President J\u00f6rg Rocholl. The Executive MBA/MPA combines two internationally renowned, successful programs: the EMBA from ESMT and the EMPA from the Doha Institute. The two-year program is modular and can be completed while continuing to work. Modules will take place once per month over three or four days. Most of the courses will be held in Doha, with one core module in Berlin, as well as the opportunity for participants to study at partner institutions in ESMT\u2019s network. Application requirements include a university degree, professional experience of at least five years, as well as very good English skills. The program will start in September 2018. Applications are currently being accepted by the Doha Institute.

These should be used to complement human workers and not take their place, Hofmann said. \n\u201cAlgorithms should not replace humans, but should take over assignments that cannot be solved by humans,\u201d he said. \nThe VW executive expressed optimism about the technology\u2019s potential. \u201cAI will make completely new things possible,\u201d he said. \nHofmann cited inspiration from Isaac Asimov\u2019s 1950 book \u201cI, Robot,\u201d which described a future with multitude of tasks assumed by robots. Asimov stated three basic principles for robots: They should never injure humans, obey orders and protect their own existence. These three principles also broadly apply to AI, Hofmann said. \nThe VW CIO also discussed the potential of Quantum computing-based machine learning, a new area that would allow machine learning to progress faster than is currently possible. Such an approach could help deal with growing data volumes in the auto industry. \nAI can also help when relatively few data are available for analysis, Hofmann said. -By Arjen Bongard", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "isaac asimov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asimov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vw cio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw cio hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw group cio martin hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:08:24.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a2dc93c34946dbf03be62c71f5cca4affa3c47d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTafqxhGxxJJr6vLYsHhBr4.CvP9U0Sj_BARLB2OkQhckSE7HtAMxIWgyaEAziAqT.b1fiFQTyUfMJTCDf2Li5P0RIcm.EGmQV.Q_4_Q3L6cjoLsO1KvyLpedbVH7IA8h.JC9.ggr1fSa7wCpfokZGyPH2rzKZZoIA-", "site_full": "www.mdr.de", "site": "mdr.de", "site_section": "http://www.mdr.de/Media/podcast/4268635-podcast.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MDR KULTUR Peter Zudeicks Woche in Berlin", "title": "Peter Zudeick - Die Woche in Berlin vom 23.
