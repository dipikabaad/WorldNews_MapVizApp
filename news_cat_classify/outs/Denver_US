(Photo: KUSA-TV, Denver) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE DENVER \u2014 A Colorado school district will transition from a five-day week to a four-day week beginning in August. Brighton-based School District 27J announced Monday the four-day week will entice quality teachers and allow for the allocation of resources to items more critical to the district's \"primary purpose.\" \"We're confident it's going to attract teachers and keep them,\" District 27J Superintendent Chris Fiedler said. \"I haven't had teachers say that this is a horrible idea.\" Other hopes for the four-day week are that it will \"reorganize and create time to support teacher development and preparedness,\" create a school calendar that increases instructional time and is \"clean, clear and concise making it less difficult for families to manage.\" \u201cI realize this will be a significant change for our students, their families, and the communities we are so fortunate to serve, but our district can no longer be expected to do more with less financial resources,\u201d the release continued. The new schedule follows the district's six failed attempts to get more money through bond elections. With the new change, Fiedler said they hope to save around $1 million in three key areas. By not running school buses on the days with no classes, he said the district estimates to save around $700,000. School District 27J plans to tack on a couple hundred thousand more dollars by not paying for substitute teachers. The final big saving, Fiedler said, would come from utility costs, but it's unclear how much that might be. While the school district plans on saving money, some parents will have to pay a little more for child care. Fiedler said the district offers child care services on the days kids won't be in school. It costs $30 a day which he admits isn't as great as the option parents currently have when their students are in class. More: Hey, boss: Moms get it done. Here's how to keep them around The district has picked Monday as the day kids won't have class. \"We really feel like Monday is the day to prepare and to be better for kids,\" Fiedler said. \"This will give people a chance to have a weekend and then come in on Monday \u2014 whether they're paid to or not because they're doing that work anyway to be prepared for kids and to be better for kids.\" Teachers will still have to work on one Monday of each month, however, it will only be half a day. Fiedler said the new schedule also gives them an extra hour each day to catch up on work, which is something they don't currently have. \u201cWe are 100% committed to providing our students with the necessary skills and competencies that will enable a future far beyond graduation. To that end, I believe it is in our students\u2019 best interest to provide high quality, engaged teachers using 21st Century tools for learning four days a week rather than not have them five days a week.\u201d School District 27J serves 18,000 students in Brighton, Commerce City, Henderson, Thornton and Aurora.

The Dolphins head coach has played a big part in Osweiler's development during the quarterback's first three years in the league (2012-14). During Osweiler's rookie year in Denver, Gase was the Broncos ' quarterbacks coach. In 2013, Gase was promoted to offensive coordinator, which was his role in Denver until he left to take the same job with the Bears in 2015. \nWith the Dolphins, Osweiler will likely provide insurance for Ryan Tannehill , who has had some trouble staying healthy over the past two years. The Dolphins starting quarterback has suffered a total of two ACL injuries over the past two seasons and it's still unclear when he might be 100 percent. Tannehill has only played in 13 of 32 regular season games over the past two seasons. \nOsweiler is coming to Miami from Denver, where he spent the 2017 season. Although the terms of Osweiler's deal haven't been released, we can probably safely assume the numbers will be nowhere close to the contract he received after leaving Denver following the 2015 season. \nIn March 2016, Osweiler signed a massive four-year, $72 million contract with the Texans that included $37 million in guaranteed money. After an ugly year in Houston, the Texans unloaded Osweiler (and his contract) in a March 2017 trade that sent him to Cleveland. However, Osweiler never actually played a regular season game with the Browns in 2017 because he was cut before the regular season started . \nThe 27-year-old quarterback visited with the Dolphins on Thursday and Miami clearly liked him enough that they didn't let him leave the building. With both Jay Cutler and Matt Moore no longer on the roster, the Dolphins were in desperate need of a quarterback. \nOsweiler, who was a second round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft , has a 13-12 career record as a starter after going 0-4 with the Broncos last season. With Osweiler on board in Miami, the Dolphins could still draft a quarterback this year , but Gase may have brought the veteran in so he doesn't feel forced to make a pick for a QB in April.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam gase brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam gase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:04:48.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79bd0446b61e500a505973a80eaaebd6a87dba0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bm_w_dC_byE8kjeeQbIOUDXhe_L3psUmT9okT02FFmiA_kL6KQV4gO5.oaqYrq6jpOgno0JS.eqDK3wMN8kK4PvgjR32sIU0O5etnAkyKRxed3_tofdaeoLT2jgBCKPpC7R4sGUH6lcqm0LS1O4xrtTRIh6zXt8g-", "site_full": "www.breitbart.com", "site": "breitbart.com", "site_section": "http://www.breitbart.com/news/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Posts - Breitbart", "title": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "title_full": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/gavel-law-courtroom-flickr.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1051, "comments": 0, "shares": 1051}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79bd0446b61e500a505973a80eaaebd6a87dba0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bm_w_dC_byE8kjeeQbIOUDXhe_L3psUmT9okT02FFmiA_kL6KQV4gO5.oaqYrq6jpOgno0JS.eqDK3wMN8kK4PvgjR32sIU0O5etnAkyKRxed3_tofdaeoLT2jgBCKPpC7R4sGUH6lcqm0LS1O4xrtTRIh6zXt8g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ben Kew", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "text": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to \u2018Islamic Jihad Union\u2019 Blogtrepreneur/Flickr by Ben Kew 23 Mar 2018 0\n The trial for a refugee from Uzbekistan charged with providing material support to a terrorist organization by wiring money to the \u201cIslamic Jihad Union\u201d (IJU) began in Denver, Colorado, on Thursday. Prosecutors claim Bahktiyor Jumaev developed a closeness with fellow Uzbek Jamshid Muhtorov when the pair shared an apartment and that the two men discussed joining the IJU through phone calls and emails by using code words such as \u201cwedding\u201d to describe jihad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to send money or property to a terrorist organization,\u201d said prosecutor Gregory Holloway at a courthouse in Denver. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nIn 2011, prosecutors say Jumaev sent $300 to Jamshid Muhtorov and later admitted to FBI agents that he knew it was going towards the IJU.\nHowever, Jumaev\u2019s attorney David Barry Savitz argued that the FBI illegally extracted a false confession from him by arresting him after a night\u2019s work and interrogating him for three hours.\nHe went on to claim that his client merely intended to pay back Muhtorov for a $500 bond required to get Jumaev out of jail and was not related to the IJU.\n\u201cHe considered himself trapped. He was scared. He was exhausted,\u201d Savitz said in his opening statement. \u201cIt was strictly intended to pay his debt and has nothing to do with the IJU.\u201d\nThe FBI\u2019s tough questioning allegedly reminded Jumaev of an experience he had in 1999 where Uzbekistan National Security agents questioned him before severely beating him.\nIn January, Jumaev\u2019s lawyers asked a judge not to allow the prosecution to show jurors a video showing the beheading of FBI agents found on Muhtorov\u2019s computer.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Mr. Jumaev viewed any or most of the Muhtorov electronic evidence, particularly the most violent ones,\u201d the motion read.\nMuhtorov was first arrested before boarding a flight in Chicago back in 2012 and is currently being tried separately. He has already served five years in jail without trial, and a decision last year to release him on bail was eventually reversed by a federal judge.\nThe men are two of a number Uzbek migrants charged with terrorism-related offenses in the past year. Last August, 22-year-old Uzbek-American Abror Habibo pled guilty to charges of agreeing to fund terrorist activity, after buying another man a plane ticket to Syria in order to join the Islamic State.\nUzbek migrant Sayfullo Saipov also faces charges of terrorist after carrying out a truck attack that killed eight people and injured at least a dozen others in the city\u2019s deadliest attack since 9/11.\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook , Twitter at @ben_kew , or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\n Jihad , National Security , Bahktiyor Jumaev , jihad , terrorism , Uzbeki , Uzbekistan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99", "https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/crime/prosecutors-in-denver-trial-uzbek-native-used-codes-to-hide-terror-payment", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99", "https://twitter.com/ben_kew", "https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/?skip_nax_wizard=true", "https://www.denverpost.com/2018/03/22/terror-trial-denver-federal-court-bakhtiyor-jumaev/", "https://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/25/jamshid-muhtorov-detained-until-trial/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gregory holloway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahktiyor jumaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamshid muhtorov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben kew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jumaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david barry savitz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "denver tries uzbek refugee on charges of wiring money to 'islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "denver tries uzbek refugee on charges of wiring money to \u2018islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uzbekistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:15:59.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5238f70ba9d7f9bd373fd2434a9449355525816f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbHLM_VB4kxeN.A.jA6tgLo.YJg0z_t_K72QpgdasRkWPuf66HKR7J6b_0AZdn7xslFOeN6YkOeoL.c6pSd9slBpi4JZd8236GbdSylIf4jiSHktt7fIlkeIhH6G3YpJ8nzmB5_DF1uhwe9SQveb_NhBXrCP4O6TqV", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/sports/horseracing/\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "L.A.

Venzor-Gonzalez had escaped custody from Denver Sheriff Department deputies during a medical transport Monday morning.\nVenzor-Gonzalez was not in the car.\nInstead, officers killed 27-year-old Steven Nguyen and wounded 23-year-old Rafael Landeros in the shooting, Archer said Thursday.\nEven though police shot the wrong person, Archer declared the shooting was justified because the officers reasonably believed they were pursuing Venzor-Gonzalez. The people in the car did not follow officers\u2019 orders and appeared to be searching for something as officers yelled for them to show their hands, she said.\n\u201cOfficers knew that Venzor-Gonzalez had been arrested in November for attempting to kill a police officer,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThey believed the actions being made inside the car were efforts to locate a weapon. So fearing for their safety the officers fired.\u201d\nThe shooting, which happened near East 40th Avenue and Albion Street, remains under investigation by the Denver District Attorney, Denver police and Aurora Police Department. District Attorney Beth McCann ultimately decides whether a police shooting is justified under state law. The police department\u2019s internal affairs bureau will investigate whether officers followed department policies in the pursuit and shooting and why the men in the car had been incorrectly identified.\nMeanwhile, Venzor-Gonzalez remains on the lam. Police consider him to be dangerous, and a manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies is ongoing. Venzor-Gonzalez engaged in a shootout with a Denver police officer in November after a car chase.\nAt the time, Venzor-Gonzalez was wanted for abducting a woman and her toddler. During the shootout, Venzor-Gonzalez was struck multiple times and was at-large for two days before police found him inside an Aurora home with high-powered weapons.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very dangerous individual,\u201d Archer said. \u201cHe remains our top priority.

The Browns subsequently cut the quarterback before the year began. He landed back in Denver, starting four games and completing just 55.8 percent of his passes for just 6.3 yards per toss with five touchdowns and five interceptions. \nThe Dolphins are in the market for a backup behind Ryan Tannehill , with both Matt Moore and Jay Cutler no longer under contract. Miami currently has David Fales and Brandon Doughty on the depth chart. Miami also is rumored to be interested in using a draft pick on a quarterback who could potentially take over for Tannehill down the road. \nAt this stage, Osweiler has proven to be a backup quarterback. Given Tannehill's injury history and Brock's familiarity with Gase's system, it makes sense for Miami to look at a backup who at least has starting reps under his belt.

Later this year, you\u2019ll get your chance. About 1,200 animals \u2014 300 species \u2014 will soon call Littleton\u2019s Southwest Plaza mall home.\nSeaQuest Interactive Aquarium is expanding its reach to the Denver suburb. It already has locations in Las Vegas, Fort Worth, Texas, and Layton, Utah.\n\u201cThe mall reached out to us,\u201d said Elsa Macdonald, national marketing director for SeaQuest, as part of an effort to boost the shopping center\u2019s industry. All of SeaQuest\u2019s current locations are inside malls.\nTeams of construction workers are creating a 20,000-square-foot aquatic world on the plaza\u2019s lower level, next to Dillard\u2019s. By late spring, the concrete slabs will mimic tropical forests, underwater utopias and frigid, arctic expanses. Room to room, visitors will be able to feed and touch animals from around the globe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to transition throughout the entire world,\u201d general manager Grant Carter said of the upcoming exhibits.\nCarter said he expects visitors will get the chance to come face-to-face with species they may have never heard of, including his favorite, the coatimundi, which he described adoringly as a \u201craccoon-monkey.\u201d Additionally, visitors will be able to swim with stingrays, take selfies with sharks and snuggle with snakes.\n\u201cThe kids just light up when they\u2019re able to touch the animals and interact with them,\u201d Carter added.\nWhat makes SeaQuest different from other aquariums? It is designed to be hands-on \u2014 not only with animals, but also with the community. Macdonald said SeaQuest hopes to be an integral part of nearby neighborhoods by supporting local nonprofits, hosting field trips for kids, working with STEM students of all ages and even acting as a tropical pet rescue for animals such as parakeets and iguanas.\nEducational stations throughout the aquarium will teach visitors about several topics, including different climates and the importance of conservation.\nMore than 400,000 people visited SeaQuest locations last year, Macdonald said. She hopes to increase that number with the addition of the Littleton location and another in Southern California.\nRelated Articles Horse trapped in rocks near Boulder trail had to be euthanized after unsuccessful rescue attempts Zinke supports restoration of grizzlies in North Cascades U.N. reports see a lonelier planet with fewer plants, animals Australian volunteers save 5 of over 150 stranded whales The Denver Zoo\u2019s new baby sloth has a name \u2014 and it\u2019s as sweet as candy So, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to work at an aquarium, now\u2019s your chance.\n\u201cMermaids are real at SeaQuest,\u201d Carter said, hinting at an available job title. \u201cThe hiring process (for several positions) will be ramping up within the next few weeks.\u201d\nPresale and discounted passes are available online until the end of the month at littleton.visitseaquest.com .
