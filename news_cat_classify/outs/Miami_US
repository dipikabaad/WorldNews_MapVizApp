(Full disclosure: It\u2019s entirely my fault. Also full disclosure: I am an idiot.)\nLast March, I booked a trip to Miami for me, my wife and our 2-year-old and 4-year-old children without doing even a cursory check of the local calendar. Everybody\u2014except me, apparently\u2014knows that March is Spring Break season. This time of year, you need to use caution in planning a beach getaway\u2014unless you want to spend your family vacation doing Jell-O shots and keg stands, which, I don\u2019t know, maybe you do, you lunatics.\nI learned of my screw-up a few weeks before arrival, when I got an upbeat email from a reservationist announcing that our hotel would be hosting a series of poolside events for the \u201cMiami Winter Music Conference.\u201d\n\u201cThough this is a very exciting time for both our locals and tourists,\u201d the note read, \u201ci t tends to be a more vibrant vibe than our typical tranquil atmosphere.\u201d\nOh dear. I knew what that meant: BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nAs in the throbbing, wordless, molar-rattling, DJ-driven electronic music which forms the soundtrack for a lot of dance party fun for young people who are far cooler than me. I consider myself a reasonably hip adult\u2014I don\u2019t fall asleep on the couch most Saturdays until after 9 p.m.\u2014but I would rather spend a day inside a garbage can being hit with a hammer than endure 10 minutes of BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nThis was a disaster. I wrote back to the hotel, politely asking if there was some alternative situation.\nOK, that\u2019s not true. I threw a hissy fit.\nThe hotel was apologetic and tried to make good. They offered to help us change our dates (not possible, since we\u2019d booked air travel and it was a school vacation week for my wife, a teacher). They offered to move us to another hotel, but that proved difficult, because it was peak season, and besides, every other hotel was having its own BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA bash.\nThen the hotel offered to upgrade our family to a two-bedroom suite.\nA two-bedroom suite? You don\u2019t say. I\u2019d never stayed in a room that nice in my life.\nHow bad could it be? I asked my wife.\n\u201cBad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\nStill, we went. What were we going to do, stay home and freeze in the Arctic? Why not try to tough it out in the fancy suite? Had I gotten so old and cranky that I\u2019d forgotten how to have big, noisy fun? Maybe I would love the dance party.\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, it was tranquil. You could have heard a kitten tiptoe across the lobby. We took the kids to the pool, and they were ecstatic.\nIn a corner, a sound crew worked on a speaker set, but Day One was blissfully quiet. The next day, it began around noon: BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA. It sounded like a jet engine wrestling a jackhammer.\n\u2018 Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action. \u2019\nSoon, the Spring Breakers arrived. First it was a handful, then a truckload. All the BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA didn\u2019t faze them in the slightest. They drank cocktails from plastic cups, floated in the pool, compared sunburns and yelled at each other over the din.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: My kids thought it was fantastic . They couldn\u2019t believe their luck to be at a place like this, with all these people, loud music and tattoos. Someone threw a pile of beach balls into the pool. Free beach balls!\nIt underlined a truth about family vacations: Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action.\nThe Spring Breakers, meanwhile, thought we were hilarious\u2014the pasty parents who had brought preschoolers to a music festival. They chatted up the children, asking them about dinosaurs, animals, french fries. They were really quite sweet. There wasn\u2019t a boorish drunk in the group. It turns out that the Winter Music Conference isn\u2019t totally a Spring Break bacchanal\u2014there\u2019s an international crowd of electronic music connoisseurs who really know their BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nThere\u2019s also this: the Miami BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA world doesn\u2019t do mornings. We had the early hours at the pool to ourselves. The young guests would trickle in around midday, groggily. The party didn\u2019t really get going until late afternoon, and then we\u2019d escape to the beach or go on a bike ride.\nMore Essays from Review\nSpring Break in Miami\u2014With Our Toddlers March 23, 2018 Who Is the Real Atticus Finch?

March 16, 2018 Frankly, it was a fun vacation. And a weird relief. As a parent of toddlers, I\u2019m used to us being the loudest, most objectionable thing in every room we walk into. When we walk into an airplane or restaurant, we\u2019re used to the looks of horror: Please please oh please don\u2019t sit next to me with those horrible kids.\nFor a few days, we were the quiet ones. I loved it almost as much as the cheese plate in the two-bedroom suite.\nNext week, we\u2019re off on another family vacation, to an undisclosed warm location. I\u2019ve made certain that it won\u2019t be the mania of last year. But when we get to the rental car, I\u2019ve got a little something for the stereo and my wife and kids. Just a few minutes of BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.

His best season came in 2015 when he had 64 receptions for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns in 15 games. \nThe Jaguars rewarded Hurns with a four-year contract extension worth up to $40 million in June 2016. Injuries limited the 26-year-old to 19 games over the past two seasons, leading to Jacksonville releasing him Tuesday. \nB/R NFL 1000 Scouts had Hurns ranked as the No. 33 outside wide receiver for the 2017 season with an overall grade of 65 out of 100:\n\"As the Jags' possession receiver, Hurns is used often over the middle, against zone coverage and on third downs. He's a trustworthy route-runner who catches mostly everything within his reach. He's not going to get deep, but he's a solid contested-catch receiver outside and a physical asset in the slot, especially in the red zone.\" \nHurns' recent injury history is a concern, but his age makes it easy to bet on his potential and returning to the 2015 form that made him a star. \nOffensive playmakers are always in demand, so for the Cowboys to land one at this stage of free agency is a boon to their upside in 2018. \nThe Cowboys have had a quiet offseason to this point. Their biggest move came prior to free agency when DeMarcus Lawrence received the franchise tag. \nAdding Hurns brings a new dimension to Dallas' offense in 2018. Dez Bryant didn't have the same explosiveness last season, averaging a career-low 12.1 yards per reception, and he's only caught 50 percent of the passes thrown in his direction over the past three seasons (150 out of 300). \nHurns gives the Cowboys four wide receivers capable of starting for most teams in the league. He will be lining up alongside Bryant, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley. \nIf Ezekiel Elliott can return to his rookie form, quarterback Dak Prescott will have a wealth of playmakers to spread the ball around to next season. \nThe Cowboys are chasing the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East, so having a powerful offense is a good way to try combating the reigning Super Bowl champions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "allen hurns", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hurns", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jags", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:16:40.119+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be6bb032ae9d587a45564a4e2931ec663f05a3a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZR7C2M3LsRiyKhhGrmNJ4EGixiaqYu1zjTiT.BDN7sd4crE41W0VzyzBiulq0rkMf3iRYZtDDT5_LZiPaKPTIVO26VLszCXn1THABDUQf9bJ57tzt434ZcceFy.e.DYMShNJwxNX69.4Q--", "site_full": "www.cbssports.com", "site": "cbssports.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "title_full": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "published": "2018-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.137, "main_image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2018/03/25/b844164c-becd-48fe-89e3-be024222d593/thumbnail/770x433/456697049162ca12a81dd6dcebcad480/loyola-final-four-kansas-state.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 438, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4296, "comments": 0, "shares": 4296}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be6bb032ae9d587a45564a4e2931ec663f05a3a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZR7C2M3LsRiyKhhGrmNJ4EGixiaqYu1zjTiT.BDN7sd4crE41W0VzyzBiulq0rkMf3iRYZtDDT5_LZiPaKPTIVO26VLszCXn1THABDUQf9bJ57tzt434ZcceFy.e.DYMShNJwxNX69.4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chip Patterson", "published": "2018-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "text": "14h ago \u2022 4 min read \nATLANTA -- Loyola-Chicago has captured the hearts of college basketball fans everywhere this March, and now it will have a chance to compete for a national championship on the game's biggest stage after beating Kansas State 78-62 to be crowned as champions of the South Region. \nSenior guard Ben Richardson scored a career-high 23 points to lead the Ramblers, who will play Michigan in the Final Four. \n\"Ben sat there and watched Donte [Ingram] and Clayton [Custer] and Marques [Townes] and Dre [Jackson] have big shots,\" head coach Porter Moser told CBS Sports after the game. \"And he comes in there. He is the epitome of character and winning. Just so awesome to see him do that. And that's such a great lesson for so many kids. There was no jealousy or envy, it was about winning and he was ready mentally to step up when it was his time.\" \nArguably the toughest corner of the bracket, the one with the overall No. 1 seed and four conference tournament champions, has been where we've found this year's most unlikely outcomes, from the first-ever 16-over-1 upset to a mid-major from the Missouri Valley Conference making a Final Four run as a No. 11-seed. \nOn the court Loyola packed all of the thrills, beating the third-place team in the ACC (Miami), the SEC regular season co-champions ( Tennessee ) and the Mountain West champions ( Nevada ) by a combined four points. Off the court Loyola introduced the rest of the country to Sister Jean, a kind-hearted and noble face of the NCAA Tournament after a season mostly defined by scandal tied to an ongoing corruption investigation by the FBI. \nLoyola's team fits the model of what so many love about college basketball and this tournament as well. This group doesn't wow you with size or speed when they get off the bus, but the ball moves faster than any player and no one passes the ball better as a team than the Ramblers. There isn't a bad passer on the team, and any one of the rotation players has the potential to to be the team's primary offensive threat on a given night. It's one of the things that makes Loyola so good in the closing moments of these close games: opponents can't turn their attention to any one player because anyone on the floor could potentially be the go-to guy of the moment. \nThe unusual way the region unfolded gave Loyola an Elite Eight foe different from the top seeds that George Mason and VCU had to beat in 2006 and 2011. After beating a No. 6, a No. 3 and a No. 7, the last test was No. 9 Kansas State. The way the game unfolded broke the mold from previous tournament wins as well, with Loyola leading by as many as 21 in the second half and then holding on for the program-defining win in the final minutes. It\u2019s a Cinderella story! For the first time since 1963, Loyola is going to the Final Four! pic.twitter.com/6QUQngjbuM \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 25, 2018 \nWhile Loyola's Final Four run certainly counts as a Cinderella story in the the lore of the tournament, these haven't been massive upsets or a big surprise to anyone who has followed the Ramblers in 2018. Winners in 32 of their 37 games this year, Loyola has been one of the most successful teams in all of college basketball this season. \nNow we all will tune in to see if Loyola can eclipse the accomplishments of George Mason and VCU, the last two mid-major teams to make a run to the Final Four from the 11-line. If there's a reason to think the Ramblers can do it, it's their body of work heading into the NCAA Tournament. George Mason and VCU each got bounced from its conference tournaments, requiring an at-large bid. In the case of George Mason, the NCAA Tournament bid came with national criticism. In the case of VCU we know the Rams were one of the last teams in the field because their path began in the First Four. \nLSU also made the Final Four as a No. 11 seed in 1986. All three No. 11 seeds lost in the national semifinals. \nOne of the things that driven Loyola all season has been a hunger to achieve more. Loyola won a share of the MVC regular season title, but there was a drive among the players to win the crown outright. While outsiders buzzed about the Ramblers' need to win the conference tournament to avoid sweating out Selection Sunday as a mid-major team on the bubble, the players remained focused on the task at hand and left to question as to their postseason future by winning the league's auto-bid in Arch Madness. \nLoyola had not made the NCAA Tournament since 1985 prior to this season, but it's not totally foreign territory for the program. Though it did not occur in their lifetime, the players talk about how Loyola is the only program in the state of Illinois to have a national championship. With a 33-year tournament drought already snapped, Loyola now gets to fly to San Antonio with a chance to recapture some of that 1963 magic, with Sister Jean front and center, of course.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "loyola-chicago", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben richardson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri valley conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loyola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T03:26:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a8c0401d0bbeb1c54db8b1f28259c272f03f66b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZT01PU4BtI.PSxFJU3.hFwlYLhe4Jzqd4ivWSnfzCkZFkGm.Rku8G9WrkvXmnJZuikDN3YsR793E0nmBi1ruSJ.BbZD3Fk0f2zhl3rOArqPsmllg6ryAWgc03WsTd2QV7o-", "site_full": "www.cbssports.com", "site": "cbssports.com", "site_section": "http://www.cbssports.com/partners/feeds/rss/cb_news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "CBSSports.com Headlines", "title": "Report: Alabama, Notre Dame discussing future home-and-home football series", "title_full": "Report: Alabama, Notre Dame discussing future home-and-home football series", "published": "2018-03-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2018/03/24/868c3b78-195a-4930-8492-58213d52b79d/thumbnail/770x433/6fc269b3129223fea4def53157bd82db/usatsi-10025098-220956-lowres.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 438, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2078, "comments": 0, "shares": 2078}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a8c0401d0bbeb1c54db8b1f28259c272f03f66b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZT01PU4BtI.PSxFJU3.hFwlYLhe4Jzqd4ivWSnfzCkZFkGm.Rku8G9WrkvXmnJZuikDN3YsR793E0nmBi1ruSJ.BbZD3Fk0f2zhl3rOArqPsmllg6ryAWgc03WsTd2QV7o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Barrett Sallee", "published": "2018-03-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report: Alabama, Notre Dame discussing future home-and-home football series", "text": "1h ago \u2022 1 min read \nAlabama and Notre Dame last met on the gridiron in January 2013 in Miami, where the Crimson Tide stomped the Fighting Irish 42-14 in the BCS National Championship Game to claim the 2012 national championship. \nA chance at redemption for the Fighting Irish could be on the way. Two chances, in fact. \nAccording to a report from the Tuscaloosa News , the two sides are hammering out details for games in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and South Bend, Indiana , although no specific years were mentioned. The report also cited Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne's desire to schedule additional home-and-home series, which would mark a departure from the norm for the program during the Nick Saban era (2007-present). \nDuring that time period, the Crimson Tide have typically participated in Power Five out-of-conference matchups at neutral sites, including: two neutral site games vs. Florida State (2007, 2017), one with Clemson (2008), two with Virginia Tech (2009 and 2013), one with Michigan (2012), one with West Virginia (2014), one vs. Wisconsin (2015) and one against USC (2016). They play Louisville in Orlando to open the 2018 season, Duke in Atlanta in 2019 and Miami in Atlanta in 2021. \nThe only Power Five home-and-home series they've played during the Saban era was at Penn State (home in 2010 and on the road in 2011). Saban also took the Crimson Tide to Duke to finish up a previously-existing deal in 2010 -- one week after hosting the Nittany Lions. \nAs an independent, Notre Dame's schedule is a little more flexible.

Wayne Huizenga dies at 80", "text": "MIAMI -- H. Wayne Huizenga, a college dropout who built a business empire that included Blockbuster Entertainment, AutoNation and three professional sports franchises, has died. He was 80.\nHuizenga died Thursday night at his home, said Valerie Hinkell, a longtime assistant. She gave no details on a cause of death.\nStarting with a single garbage truck in 1968, Huzienga built Waste Management Inc. into a Fortune 500 company. He purchased independent sanitation engineering companies, and by the time he took the company public in 1972, he had completed the acquisition of 133 small-time haulers. By 1983, Waste Management was the largest waste disposal company in the United States.\nThe business model worked again with Blockbuster Video, which he started in 1985 and built into the leading movie rental chain nine years later. In 1996, he formed AutoNation and built it into a Fortune 500 company.\nHuizenga was founding owner of baseball's Florida Marlins and the NHL Florida Panthers -- expansion teams that played their first games in 1993. He bought the NFL Miami Dolphins and their stadium for $168 million in 1994 from the children of founder Joe Robbie, but had sold all three teams by 2009.\nThe Marlins won the 1997 World Series, and the Panthers reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1996, but Huizenga's beloved Dolphins never reached a Super Bowl while he owned the team.\n\"If I have one disappointment, the disappointment would be that we did not bring a championship home,\" Huizenga said shortly after he sold the Dolphins to New York real estate billionaire Stephen Ross. \"It's something we failed to do.\"\nStephen Ross on the passing of Wayne Huizenga pic.twitter.com/Bg9J1e6Yhy\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) March 23, 2018 Huizenga earned an almost cult-like following among business investors who watched him build Blockbuster Entertainment into the leading video rental chain by snapping up competitors. He cracked Forbes' list of the 100 richest Americans, becoming chairman of Republic Services, one of the nation's top waste management companies, and AutoNation, the nation's largest automotive retailer. In 2013, Forbes estimated his wealth at $2.5 billion.\nFor a time, Huizenga was also a favorite with South Florida sports fans, drawing cheers and autograph seekers in public. The crowd roared when he danced the hokey pokey on the field during an early Marlins game. He went on a spending spree to build a veteran team that won the World Series in the franchise's fifth year.\nBut his popularity plummeted when he ordered the roster dismantled after that season. He was frustrated by poor attendance and his failure to swing a deal for a new ballpark built with taxpayer money.\nMany South Florida fans never forgave him for breaking up the championship team. Huizenga drew boos when introduced at Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino's retirement celebration in 2000, and kept a lower public profile after that.\nIn 2009, Huizenga said he regretted ordering the Marlins' payroll purge.\n\"We lost $34 million the year we won the World Series, and I just said, 'You know what, I'm not going to do that,'\" Huizenga said. \"If I had it to do over again, I'd say, 'OK, we'll go one more year.'\"\nHe sold the Marlins in 1999 to John Henry, and sold the Panthers in 2001, unhappy with rising NHL player salaries and the stock price for the team's public company.\nHuizenga's first sports love was the Dolphins -- he had been a season-ticket holder since their first season in 1966. But he fared better in the NFL as a businessman than as a sports fan.\nHe turned a nifty profit by selling the Dolphins and their stadium for $1.1 billion, nearly seven times what he paid to become sole owner. But he knew the bottom line in the NFL is championships, and his Dolphins perennially came up short.\nHuizenga earned a reputation as a hands-off owner and won raves from many loyal employees, even though he made six coaching changes. He eased Pro Football Hall of Famer Don Shula into retirement in early 1996, and Jimmy Johnson, Dave Wannstedt, interim coach Jim Bates, Nick Saban, Cam Cameron and Tony Sporano followed as coach.\nHarry Wayne Huizenga was born in the Chicago suburbs on Dec. 29, 1937, to a family of garbage haulers. He began his business career in Pompano Beach in 1962, driving a garbage truck from 2 a.m. to noon each day for $500 a month.\nOne customer successfully sued Huizenga, saying that in an argument over a delinquent account, Huizenga injured him by grabbing his testicles -- an allegation Huizenga always denied.\n\"I never did that. The guy was a deputy cop. It was his word against mine, a young kid,\" he told Fortune magazine in 1996.\nHuizenga was a five-time recipient of Financial World magazine's \"CEO of the Year\" award, and was the Ernst & Young \"2005 World Entrepreneur of the Year.\"\nRegarding his business acumen, Huzienga said: \"You just have to be in the right place at the right time. It can only happen in America.\"\nIn 1960, he married Joyce VanderWagon. Together they had two children, Wayne Jr. and Scott. They divorced in 1966. Wayne married his second wife, Marti Goldsby, in 1972. She died in 2017.\nWe mourn the loss of a beloved member of the Dolphins family.\nYour kindness and generosity can be felt throughout South Florida.\nWe will miss you Mr. H. pic.twitter.com/bWrNjbU17q\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) March 23, 2018 Copyright 2018 by The Associated Press.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/bWrNjbU17q", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/977273898071969792", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/977225659838861312", "https://t.co/Bg9J1e6Yhy"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "h. wayne huizenga", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "huizenga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie hinkell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huzienga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "waste management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waste management inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhl florida panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida marlins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "autonation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:11:55.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abe149161d9b72d71cc3edc56fb74bb6cee44fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo2O1fWYpUdITlflLgDfpnvrowJmXozvGODFLjwbmm5zvpsn3W7Dn1TNqt7yoCfDDaeWrUepKoubu1acdehvsZTUZOpq1sOf2xPZO__cSeYYOb2XfW5qwZcR4LZBzXv7fxFOGFvthhIOJEjpy9S6ppRuSV8jxCL_jk-", "site_full": "bleacherreport.com", "site": "bleacherreport.com", "site_section": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/feed#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bleacher Report - Front Page", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four", "title_full": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four | Bleacher Report", "published": "2018-03-25T04:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/731/577/hi-res-2c6a3055d0278e9de4eb0d0b175b9509_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1200&amp;q=75", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 506, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3905, "comments": 0, "shares": 3905}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abe149161d9b72d71cc3edc56fb74bb6cee44fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo2O1fWYpUdITlflLgDfpnvrowJmXozvGODFLjwbmm5zvpsn3W7Dn1TNqt7yoCfDDaeWrUepKoubu1acdehvsZTUZOpq1sOf2xPZO__cSeYYOb2XfW5qwZcR4LZBzXv7fxFOGFvthhIOJEjpy9S6ppRuSV8jxCL_jk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Kenyon", "published": "2018-03-25T04:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four", "text": "Loyola continued its magical run Saturday. Now, the Ramblers are headed to the Final Four. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images The Loyola of Chicago Ramblers arrived at the Big Dance with only a bit of attention. Four victories later, they're guaranteed to leave March Madness as a legendary team.\nThanks to a 78-62 victory over the Kansas State Wildcats, the Ramblers earned a spot in the Final Four and secured their place in men's college basketball history.\nLoyola, the No. 11 seed in the South Regional, joined 1985-86 LSU, 2005-06 George Mason and 2010-11 VCU as the lowest seed to ever reach the national semifinals. That alone is reason enough for the Ramblers to be remembered in the annals of the NCAA tournament.\nBut because of how they kept surviving and advancing, Loyola will be one of the most memorable Cinderella stories.\nOn their way to the Elite Eight, the Ramblers edged sixth-seeded Miami just before the buzzer. They clipped No. 3 seed Tennessee when a jumper rattled home in the closing seconds. They buried No. 7 seed Nevada with a late three.\nBased on margin of victory, this unexpected run is unparalleled in March Madness history.\nOnly 1980-81 Saint Joseph's also won its first three games by a combined four points, per ESPN Stats & Info . But in the Elite Eight, that squad lost by 32 points. Loyola, on the other hand\u2014with a trip to San Antonio at stake\u2014led for the final 36 minutes of Saturday's game.\nThe Ramblers left no doubt they deserved a spot in the Final Four.\nNicole Auerbach @NicoleAuerbach Loyola to the Final Four. And it ain\u2019t even close.\nOne noteworthy point the coming years will determine is whether a specific player will be immortalized. That seems improbable, since Donte Ingram, Clayton Custer and Marques Townes all hit clutch shots and no player has consistently taken over games a la Stephen Curry for 2007-08 Davidson.\nGranted, Sister Jean\u2014the 98-year-old team chaplain whose likeness was featured on a collectible bobblehead \u2014could fill that role.\nStill, it's more likely Loyola will be remembered for its collective success as a scarcely known mid-major program. 2005-06 George Mason and 2010-11 VCU also fit that description.\nReally, that would be the most fitting legacy for Porter Moser's team. For many\u2014if not all\u2014of these players, this will be the glory days story they tell their children and grandchildren.\nCuster paced the Ramblers with 14 points in their opening game. Aundre Jackson's 16 led the way during the second round. Townes notched a team-best 18 in the Sweet 16. Ben Richardson eclipsed his previous season high of 14 by pouring in 23 during the South Regional-clinching victory.\nNCAA March Madness @marchmadness BIG BUCKET from Ben Richardson! \ud83d\udc4c Loyola Chicago stops a 10-0 run by the Wildcats with the SWISH! #MarchMadness #Elite8 https://t.co/Ihc9d0Vh90\nLoyola is team basketball exemplified. And given its coach's path, that shouldn't be a surprise.\nMoser utilizes concepts he learned from his former boss, Rick Majerus. The Ramblers showcase a free-flowing motion offense and a pack-line defense\u2014a similar philosophy to what Virginia was decried for using because it \"led\" to a historic upset in the first round.\nIn the not-too-distant future, the 49-year-old Moser may be fielding calls from power-conference schools. That's a common theme in the history of remarkable tournament runs.\nJim Larranaga\u2014who oversaw George Mason's surge\u2014eventually headed to Miami, and he's guided the Hurricanes to four of the 10 NCAA tournament bids in program history. Shaka Smart made VCU into an annual tourney qualifier prior to leaving for Texas.\nBut no matter whether Moser stays at Loyola for a long time, he'll always be the coach of a legendary Cinderella journey.\nExactly where does this one rank all-time? That question will be debated now and in the future. But that's not as important as one concurrent truth.\nThe glass slipper fit.\nAnd now, Loyola is unforgettable.\n\nStats via Sports Reference and NCAA.com unless otherwise noted.

The Dolphins head coach has played a big part in Osweiler's development during the quarterback's first three years in the league (2012-14). During Osweiler's rookie year in Denver, Gase was the Broncos ' quarterbacks coach. In 2013, Gase was promoted to offensive coordinator, which was his role in Denver until he left to take the same job with the Bears in 2015. \nWith the Dolphins, Osweiler will likely provide insurance for Ryan Tannehill , who has had some trouble staying healthy over the past two years. The Dolphins starting quarterback has suffered a total of two ACL injuries over the past two seasons and it's still unclear when he might be 100 percent. Tannehill has only played in 13 of 32 regular season games over the past two seasons. \nOsweiler is coming to Miami from Denver, where he spent the 2017 season. Although the terms of Osweiler's deal haven't been released, we can probably safely assume the numbers will be nowhere close to the contract he received after leaving Denver following the 2015 season. \nIn March 2016, Osweiler signed a massive four-year, $72 million contract with the Texans that included $37 million in guaranteed money. After an ugly year in Houston, the Texans unloaded Osweiler (and his contract) in a March 2017 trade that sent him to Cleveland. However, Osweiler never actually played a regular season game with the Browns in 2017 because he was cut before the regular season started . \nThe 27-year-old quarterback visited with the Dolphins on Thursday and Miami clearly liked him enough that they didn't let him leave the building. With both Jay Cutler and Matt Moore no longer on the roster, the Dolphins were in desperate need of a quarterback. \nOsweiler, who was a second round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft , has a 13-12 career record as a starter after going 0-4 with the Broncos last season. With Osweiler on board in Miami, the Dolphins could still draft a quarterback this year , but Gase may have brought the veteran in so he doesn't feel forced to make a pick for a QB in April.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam gase brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam gase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:04:48.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e20d2ec46515f4347f360748ad2e093a362bd9f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxNRdF1HRthPAOE8.Q_Wh8ZBrQV5AvtAc40BEFcXjkgtRtpoFfuf_F8el.6ye2I9OAmnacJJqRBH0cspOAL795qA--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Holds Off Nevada for a Third Straight Upset", "title_full": "Loyola-Chicago Holds Off Nevada for a Third Straight Upset", "published": "2018-03-23T08:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/22/sports/22ncaa-drape-loyola/22ncaa-drape-loyola-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3285, "comments": 0, "shares": 3285}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e20d2ec46515f4347f360748ad2e093a362bd9f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxNRdF1HRthPAOE8.Q_Wh8ZBrQV5AvtAc40BEFcXjkgtRtpoFfuf_F8el.6ye2I9OAmnacJJqRBH0cspOAL795qA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JOE DRAPE", "published": "2018-03-23T08:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Holds Off Nevada for a Third Straight Upset", "text": " Loyola-Chicago\u2019s Marques Townes celebrated a late 3-pointer in the Ramblers\u2019 69-68 victory over Nevada. Credit John Amis/Associated Press ATLANTA \u2014 Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt knew she was going to have to rip up one of the two N.C.A.A tournament brackets she filled out after her beloved Loyola-Chicago Ramblers faced Nevada here Thursday. Before Sister Jean, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain, surged to Kardashian-level fame on social media \u2014 albeit chaste and devout \u2014 she served both as Loyola\u2019s divine inspiration and as a scout who crafted detailed basketball reports that even Mike Krzyzewski would love.\nLoyola\u2019s 69-68 victory over Nevada here on Thursday ensured that Sister Jean would get to rip up the right bracket, which actually was the wrong one. See, the Mother Teresa side of Sister Jean\u2019s personality moved her to slot her beloved Ramblers into the national title game. She called it her Cinderella bracket, and now, after the No. 11-seeded Ramblers upset No. 6 Miami, No. 3 Tennessee and then Nevada, Sister Jean and her dreams are very much alive.\nBut, alas, she could not dismiss the other side of her soul, that of the basketball lifer. So Sister Jean hedged: She filled out another bracket with the Ramblers being eliminated here, in the semifinals of the South Regional.\nIn the first half, the No. 7-seeded Wolf Pack (29-7) looked every bit the powerhouse that had erased a 22-point deficit to stun No. 2-seeded Cincinnati, 75-73, to reach the round of 16. It was a 20-minute chess match punctuated by Loyola fast breaks that were rarely finished. Nevada blocked five of Loyola\u2019s shots, all at point blank range, as the Wolf Pack took a 12-point lead late in the half.\n There was reason, however, for the Wolf Pack to worry even then.\nNevada had struggled to score from long range, shooting just 2 of 13 from beyond the 3-point arc and were 9 of 27 from the field. The Ramblers did not quit, found their scoring touch and put together a 12-0 run to take 28-24 lead into halftime.\nPhoto Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt observing during the first half of Loyola\u2019s victory. Credit David Goldman/Associated Press In the second half, the Wolf Pack doubled down on a smothering defense that forced Loyola into three shot-clock violations and another half-dozen hurried, off-balance attempts. With 3 minutes 18 seconds left, Nevada tied the score at 59-59 when Cody Martin floated through the lane for a soaring layup.\n Now Sister Jean and the Rambler faithful had reason to murmur some prayers.\nAundre Jackson drained a 3-pointer to give Loyola a 62-59 lead with 2:38 left. But with 1:20 left, Martin nailed a 3 of his own to bring Nevada within one, 64-63. But with 41 seconds left, Jackson drew a foul and hit both free throws to put the Ramblers up, 66-63.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

It was just \u2014 that\u2019s something you dream about,\u201d Townes said. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Sweet 16 and you hit a big shot like that. It\u2019s just amazing. I\u2019m just blessed to be in that position.\u201d\nMartin hit another from beyond the arc with 1.4 seconds left to add some late drama. Still, Loyola, ahead by a point, just needed to successfully inbound the ball.\nThey did, and Sister Jean\u2019s Cinderella bracket survived for at least another game.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for Sister Jean, for busting her bracket,\u201d Townes said. \u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re just happy to be in this position and going to the Elite Eight.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marques townes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "loyola-chicago", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mother teresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean dolores schmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike krzyzewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "loyola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit john amis/associated press atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T05:02:39.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "118df53b03ac8c86e3d5b335c2bfa06ab9b8d9cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bQuofQBLDKhazf7CkjkZDuoQv19Ki0PfVpmWx4QpbIP1ZcQKBtyv3nRJlBG5YwCy0S7MHkWu5BHG0Sor4lcblzAhXmbbTL61uW8BWikJDDpNC4YrXHzKE4QuSnR6c3BHJd.N7QXIBCXi0HXnu7AH", "site_full": "www.miami.com", "site": "miami.com", "site_section": "http://www.miami.com/taxonomy/term/1408/0/feed", "site_categories": ["sailing", "sports"], "section_title": "Miami.com", "title": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "title_full": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "published": "2018-03-22T20:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Coffee_Amelias_MJO_6.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1716, "comments": 2, "shares": 1716}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "118df53b03ac8c86e3d5b335c2bfa06ab9b8d9cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bQuofQBLDKhazf7CkjkZDuoQv19Ki0PfVpmWx4QpbIP1ZcQKBtyv3nRJlBG5YwCy0S7MHkWu5BHG0Sor4lcblzAhXmbbTL61uW8BWikJDDpNC4YrXHzKE4QuSnR6c3BHJd.N7QXIBCXi0HXnu7AH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carlos Fr\u00edas", "published": "2018-03-22T20:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "text": "READ: No Cuban abuela ? No problem. These are Miami\u2019s best Cuban restaurants \nIf you\u2019re new to Miami or here on vacation, you may have already discovered our devotion to \u201cventanitas,\u201d the ubiquitous walk-up windows where a coffee queen will whip up a cup of jet fuel while calling you cari\u00f1o or mi amor . ( One guy even spent a summer visiting more than 100 of them across Miami .) Gabriela Carbone, 20, a barista at Amelia\u2019s 1931, prepares a cortadito. \nThere\u2019s a right way to order coffee in Miami that won\u2019t earn you a strange look. Locals know there are only four acceptable coffee drinks to order at the ventanita: Cafecito Cafecitos are life. Matias Ocner \nOrder \u201cun cafecito\u201d and la se\u00f1ora at the ventanita will set down a cup and saucer in front of you that looks like it came from a child\u2019s play set. \nDo not be fooled. \nThat ounce-and-a-half or so of Cuban coffee may be a single serving, but it\u2019ll be enough to power you through lunch \u2014 until someone inevitably shows up to work with una colada . (See below). When done right, the cafecito will be sweet but not cloying, covered in a rich, creamy head that\u2019ll stick to your hipster mustache \u2014 and your ribs. Colada A colada is the perfect way to share Cuban coffee with soon-to-be new friends. Matias Ocner/Miami Herald \nAsk for \u201cuna colada\u201d and the ventanita waitress will pour you a four-ounce Styrofoam cup of hot, sweet Cuban coffee \u2014 to go. You may be tempted to peel off the plastic lid and drink it like a Starbucks espresso. \nDo not do this. This is \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d dragonfire. \nThere\u2019s a reason she will hand it to you with a half-dozen corrugated, thimble-sized plastic cups. Bring these back to work after your lunch break, share with five of your closest friends, and you\u2019ll quickly be caught up on office politics. \nPro tip: Pinch the lip of the Styrofoam cup to make a spout that makes the coffee easier to pour. Cortadito Cortadito: when a straight cafecito is just too much Matias Ocner \nFor some people, even locals, it\u2019s just too much to pour the gasoline that is Cuban coffee into an empty stomach. For that, order a cortadito \u2014 a single serving of Cuban coffee \u201ccut\u201d with steamed, whole milk. \nFor a special treat, ask for a cortadito con evaporada and the waitress will substitute milk with sweet, steamed evaporated milk. It makes the perfect finish to a meal in lieu of dessert. Caf\u00e9 con leche Don\u2019t talk to me until I\u2019ve had my caf\u00e9 con leche. Matias Ocner \nMornings in Miami don\u2019t begin until after a caf\u00e9 con leche: a cup of warm, steamed or boiled milk with a shot of Cuban coffee. They may ask you if you want it clarito or oscurito \u2014 light or dark \u2014 depending on how much coffee you want to darken you drink. Feel free to say mediano for Goldilocks perfection. \nDone right, the sugar in the Cuban coffee should be enough to sweeten the caf\u00e9 con leche. (This also applies to the cortadito.) But you can always ask for it sin azucar if you prefer to sweeten it yourself or sub out (gasp!) Splenda.

The Browns subsequently cut the quarterback before the year began. He landed back in Denver, starting four games and completing just 55.8 percent of his passes for just 6.3 yards per toss with five touchdowns and five interceptions. \nThe Dolphins are in the market for a backup behind Ryan Tannehill , with both Matt Moore and Jay Cutler no longer under contract. Miami currently has David Fales and Brandon Doughty on the depth chart. Miami also is rumored to be interested in using a draft pick on a quarterback who could potentially take over for Tannehill down the road. \nAt this stage, Osweiler has proven to be a backup quarterback. Given Tannehill's injury history and Brock's familiarity with Gase's system, it makes sense for Miami to look at a backup who at least has starting reps under his belt.
