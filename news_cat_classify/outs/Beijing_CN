Photo: VCG \n\"Creditor Imperialism\" has become a new catchphrase created by India to beef up the so-called \"China threat,\" accusing China of \"using sovereign debt to bend other states to its will, without having to fire a single shot.\"Such rhetoric, typically orchestrated by Western elites, is now India's new weapon to attack China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in an attempt to influence public opinion on Chinese international strategy. Given that China's BRI is becoming increasingly popular, India is leading a new round of hype among global media with multiple versions of the \"China threat theory.\"Brahma Chellaney, an Indian expert from New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, created the new phrase, \"China's creditor imperialism,\" in the end of 2017 to attack China's BRI. In his article, the Indian expert blames China for using BRI to engage in \"Creditor Imperialism,\" by shackling participating states and forcing its partners to hand over domestic resources to repay debts. The claim was shrugged off by Chinese netizens and scholars. \"Again, it is no surprise to hear such accusations against the BRI. I think those economies who truly participated in it and get the tangible benefits from it would be the best people to respond their query,\" read a comment on Chinese social media Sina Weibo, which received the most thumbs up.\"How interesting it is to hear that so-called 'imperialism,' the patent of America, is now taken over by China. We feel rather proud, don't we?\" read another comment.Seeing the absurdity in India's updated China threat theory, Wang Wen, executive dean of Renmin University of China's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, believes that the \"debt cordon\" that was used to describe EU countries, as referred by Chellaney, is not suitable for measuring the debt status of emerging economies, stressing complementary advantages and mutual development between China and the countries joining the Belt and Road Initiative.The BRI is a transparent initiative that follows the \"golden rule\" of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference during this year's two sessions. \"It is time to lay the 'China threat theory' to rest,\" Wang said later, calling on China to shrug off the accusation during this year's two sessions. \"As China grows, the 'China collapse theory' has collapsed and become an international joke. The 'China threat theory,' with its various sensational versions, is losing steam,\" said Wang.\"Those who do not have bias or practice double standards will see in China not a threat, but plenty of opportunities,\" Wang Yi added. \nMutually benefited partnership In the Indian expert's editorial piece, he draws on the case of Sri Lanka's Hambantota port as assertive evidence of so-called \"debt bondage\" attached to projects of the BRI at the cost of losing its sovereignty.\"As Sri Lanka's handover of the strategic Hambantota port shows, states caught in debt bondage to the new imperial giant risk losing both natural assets and their very sovereignty,\" wrote the piece.Chellaney depicted China's tactic of \"imperialism\" as providing the financial largesse - the huge-project-related loans - to those partnerships caught in capital crisis in exchange for key strategic resources. Chellaney refers to it as a new type of exploitative debtor relationships.Unscrambling the accusation, Wang Wen revealed that the claim attempted to arouse memories of new colonialism after the World War II, drawing a connection between China and the plundering of resources by some Western countries in African and Asian countries.\"Taking Sri Lanka for instance, China's 99-year lease on land is subject to Sri Lanka's general rule equal for any other global companies. Sri Lanka can find a balance in maintaining sustainable economic growth and repaying the debt. It's fair to say that the project is a good example of complementary advantages and mutual development,\" wrote Wang in a commentary published in the Global Times. Sun Shihai, an expert on Sino-Indian relations from Sichuan University, also stressed the principle of \"mutual benefit\" underlined in the BRI project. \"The participation of many countries is an absolutely voluntary process but not China's imposed scheme,\" Sun told the Global Times. \"It is unfair to label China as an imperialist, as we neither robbed any resources from our partners nor colonized their lands. We have not any intention to destruct others' sovereignty.\" Keeping vigilant But such explanations hardly dispel misgiving of some Indian experts that Beijing will dictate the terms of engagement in the Belt and Road Initiative.\"Despite the fact that Beijing often says that the success of the Initiative will depend on a partnership with participating countries, this partnership remains unequal and gives rise to questions about the direction of Beijing's economic policies and ability to control these economies,\" Professor Madhu Bhalla, an expert in Sino-Indian relations from the Department of East Asian Studies of Delhi University, told Global Times.But she denied that the fears are unique to China, and rather that \"major economies have also been voiced in relation to other dominated economies\" in earlier centuries, such as the control and exploitation by EU in Africa. \"In India, given our history of colonial exploitation of natural resources and national wealth, there will always be questions about neo-colonial control of local economies through creating indebtedness and swapping of natural resources in exchange for payments,\" Bhalla continued.\"Frenemy,\" a portmanteau of friend and enemy, is an accurate way to describe India's current mentality toward China. India regards the Sino-Indian relationship as a significant part of its neighborhood diplomacy, but sprinkled with some fear and vigilance.While New Delhi promises to strengthen strategic mutual trust with Beijing, it repeatedly commits acts underlining indifference and skepticism about the Belt and Road Initiative, which jeopardizes bilateral ties. \"BRI is essentially an imperial project\u2026states caught in debt bondage to China risk losing both their most valuable natural assets and their very sovereignty,\" as Brahma Chellaney defined China's Belt and Road Initiative.India reportedly derived its potential concerns around the geopolitical threat they believe is attached to China's Belt and Road Initiative.Wang Yizhi, a professor in international relations at Renmin University of China, noted that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is believed to be one of the key factors to cause Delhi's hesitation against the initiative. The corridor runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which is considered by India to be Indian territory.Furthermore, \"China's relations with India's neighbors (Pakistan to the north, Bangladesh and Burma to the east, and Sri Lanka to the south) makes New Delhi cautious to be alienated and lose its influence in strategically important areas,\" Sun noted. Even though the Indian government has never endorsed the term \"Chinese Creditor Imperialism,\" there is much interest in how Chinese investments are being made in the Indian Ocean Littoral and elsewhere, according to Bhalla. \"India has a legitimate interest in healthy economic growth in its neighborhood, given that failed economies generally lead to intra- and inter-state conflict in the region as elsewhere. Hence its interest, and the interest of its strategic community in the future of regional economies, especially given the rising graph of indebtedness with Chinese investments, have become of some concern within these economies,\" said Bhalla. Refutation of BRI countries Similar fears have also been announced by American former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his recent trip to Africa, when he claimed China is entrapping African governments with \"opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt\" with the Belt and Road project.Some African top diplomats later responded against Tillerson's accusations. Augustine Mahiga, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tanzania, stressed the participating country's autonomy and their right sense of judgment in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. Mahiga said he is confident that, with many options for African countries to seek financing in international capital markets, Africa has sufficient freedom and capacity to compare and accept loans that meet their own needs. Abebe Aynete, a senior researcher at Ehiopian Foreign Relations Strategic Studies Institute, argues that China's investment in infrastructure projects along the BRI plan have brought about changes in African countries that are \"plain to see,\" as reported by Xinhua News Agency.Chinese investment in African countries has largely improved the livelihood of locals, including improved living conditions, creating jobs and training workers, which has won praise from the people and governments alike.\"The Chinese investment in Africa focuses on infrastructure, while the United States for a long time has focused on promoting its own values. The choice is for Africans to decide who is a better partner,\" said Aynete.In response to concerns, Wang Wen calls for more transparency in reviewing BRI projects, which he regards not only as an encouragement for Chinese firms, but also a powerful response to unfriendly insults and skepticisms from global society.\"In the face of the continued smears and slander, China has to prepare psychologically and strategically to push ahead,\" Wang concluded.Global Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global times", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vcg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T08:19:42.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb218a8dd5df99cdca2850deebf5be04160e787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEs9JvipnwLBEu3gtHSBgzlX1U1HWZAHwAWv3UC973JpD", "site_full": "www.globaltimes.cn", "site": "globaltimes.cn", "site_section": "http://www.globaltimes.cn/rss/outbrain.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "outbrain", "title": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "title_full": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "published": "2018-03-22T20:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2714, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb218a8dd5df99cdca2850deebf5be04160e787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEs9JvipnwLBEu3gtHSBgzlX1U1HWZAHwAWv3UC973JpD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T20:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "text": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival By He Keyao Source:Global Times   18:08:39 Le\u00efla Slimani (left) and Hong Huang address the issue of gender equality at a forum in Beijing on March 8. Photo: He Keyao/GT \nContrary to common misunderstandings, feminism is not an \"anti-male\" agenda, but a movement concerned with improving the lives of women and creating a more equal world for both genders. That was the strong message that a celebrated French female writer and an influential Chinese publisher delivered to the Chinese public earlier this month at an event for the ongoing Francophonie Festival in China. Amid the storm of worldwide feminist movements fueled by #MeToo, discussions and thoughts about women's social status and feminism featured prominently during a town hall talk on March 8 with award-winning French writer Le\u00efla Slimani, the youngest winner of the Prix Goncourt award for her 2016 novel Chanson Douce . The most read book in France that year, its Chinese translation has a large readership in ChinaSitting down with celebrated Chinese publisher and columnist Hong Huang, Slimani shared her experiences and thoughts on the lives of women in modern society and the true meaning of feminism. A universal problem \"The very question of asking a woman how to keep a balance between her work and her family reflects gender inequality because no one asks a man about that,\" Slimani said when asked about how she manages to be a mother with a successful career. That problematic idea that women who focus more on their career than having and raising kids are selfish and irresponsible is still very common in many places today, according to Slimani, and this has led to women struggling with becoming the \"perfect woman\" who can handle both work and home equally well. \"Maybe it's time to admit that we cannot do both that well and men need to share more work at home,\" said Slimani. According to her observations, women are often paid less than men in France, which results in women having a lower economic status in the family. This then pushes many of them to become housewives or to shoulder more responsibility in the household and thus reinforces traditional stereotypes in what is a vicious circle. However, Chinese counterparts seem to be less affected by this vicious circle when it comes to career and economic status within the family. According to 2017 statistics from sohu.com, a web portal in China, nearly 70 percent of women of working age are employed in China while in France this number sits around 62 percent, followed by 60 percent in New Zealand and 58 percent in the US. Moreover, the 2018 Hurun List of Self-Made Women Billionaires shows that 62 out of the 102 listed entrepreneurs are from China, with Beijing being home to the highest number of the world's wealthiest women. \"I have to say that in China women's social status is based more on their economic power, rather than gender. Rich women are not likely to be treated any differently than men,\" noted Hong, adding that it is often women living in poverty that suffer the most from gender discrimination and therefore \"economic independence\" is the key to improving women's social positions. Complicated social and historical factors lie behind women's rising position in China. A nationwide campaign encouraging women to work outside the home took place in the 1950s and the slogan \"women hold up half the sky,\" proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong, spread like wildfire through the country. Public education of gender equality, marriage laws and the one-child policy also helped boost the social status of Chinese women. However, when it comes to house chores and childcare, women are still the major force in China as the perception of a good mother and hardworking wife for women is difficult to change. Statistics from sohu.com shows that in 62 percent of households women outwork men at home, while in 20 percent of families women do all the household chores. The pressure to be both a good wife and a qualified employee has led to many Chinese women complaining on social media that they are the \"hardest working people\" in China. \"The problem is universal here and overseas. Women should not feel guilty for pursing their own development. Sometimes we cannot do both, and that is fine,\" said Hong. For women, not 'against men' As the #MeToo movement continues to spread worldwide, some counterproductive behavior has cropped up here and there. In South Korea, a sense of \"gynephobia\" is on the rise as some men have begun to deliberately avoid their female colleagues, worrying that the latter might file complaints about their behavior, according to a report by South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. Experts say that this practice only leads to new disadvantages for women at the workplace, as it puts the two genders at odds with each other. Regarding this \"gynephobia,\" both Slimani and Hong emphasized that feminism is not \"against men,\" but rather is about doing more to protect women and ensure they are treated equally. \"Feminism should be a humanistic concern that protects women's basic rights. I'm not against anyone,\" said Slimani. She indicated that #Metoo is about making women's voices heard, not about causing women and men to become enemies. Both genders should be treated equally. Hong noted that the word \"feminism\" is often misused in Chinese society. \"I think the word is demonized in China. It should be about gender equality and giving women a voice, rather than anything else,\" Hong said. She pointed out that some people in China who tout the idea of feminism are just using it as a guise to take advantage of men. The practice of women requiring men own apartments and cars before being willing to tie the knot is one such example. This type of \"bad feminism,\" which Hong noted has nothing to do with feminism at all, is so common that the slang term wein\u00fcquan zhuyi , or \"fake feminism\" has arisen on social media in China to describe the phenomenon.

Tsinghua University said on the same day it would recruit 15 students from both senior grade two and senior grade three students. \nThe two schools said their selections would take into consideration the students' natural talent in math, comprehensive learning ability, and psychological tests. \nIn addition to the schools' independent enrollment tests, the candidates must sit the national college entrance exam and their scores should exceed the enrollment level for China's first-class universities. \nSun Zhaojun, deputy Party chief of the Mathematic Science Institute of Peking University, said most world-renown mathematicians achieved their major achievements at the ages between 18 and 40. Those who received the Fields Medal, an international medal for outstanding discoveries in mathematics, were all aged under 40. \nPeking University hopes the elite math class can foster a group of Chinese mathematicians who will make international achievements. The development of the subject is the foundation of many math-related applications. \n\"Skilled math students show their talent and passion at an early age. Tsinghua's elite class will invite international mathematicians to teach, so as to encourage the young students' full potential,\" said Zou Wenming, dean of the Mathematics Department of Tsinghua.

That is a very tight timeline, so we do have to move forward fast\" both in terms of technology and regulations, Zeng told the Global Times on Thursday. \nWidely accepted standards divide autonomous driving into five levels. Level 3 cars are capable of taking full control when certain conditions are met, while level 5 cars can operate itself in all conditions. \nChina has listed autonomous driving as a key sector under the broad \"Made in China 2025\" initiative that aims to transfer China into a manufacturing powerhouse of advanced products. Baidu has been included in a list of artificial intelligence (AI) industry leaders, known as China's AI national team, by the Ministry of Science and Technology. \n\"To meet these goals, we have a lot of catching-up to do because we are already four to five years behind the U.S. in open road tests,\" Zeng said. \nHowever, some experts said that after a pedestrian was killed by a self-driving car operated by ride-hailing services provider Uber in a test in Arizona on March 18, US regulations could be tightened for road tests. \nAfter the accident, Boston put its self-driving car testing program on hold and started to review regulations. \nSome media reports have suggested that the tightening U.S. regulations over self-driving car tests could give China a chance to catch up in an increasingly heated competition between the countries. \nBut experts said that the regulatory changes would not slow the U.S.' effort in self-driving car development and that Chinese companies still have a way to go to catch up. \nWang Xin, who runs an influential online auto news site known as Auto Prophet, said that some Chinese companies such as Baidu are still adding self-driving features to traditional vehicles, while self-driving cars could be a whole new concept in mobile solutions. \n\"At the moment, the idea of self-driving cars is about putting sensors and cameras on top of a traditional car. They just want to make money in the car industry\u2026 that's meaningless,\" Wang told the Global Times Thursday. \"The core of autonomous driving is not about cars.\" Related news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "li yan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "download  baidu inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baidu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:24:32.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "351bca2e60b31014f750344bfbf39526f3a8cdd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhoUfKj5XBIB0e93bAiGSp1MjxR8ZLyPDFUD0qTpO7g_T", "site_full": "www.ecns.cn", "site": "ecns.cn", "site_section": "http://www.ecns.cn/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "ecns", "title": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "title_full": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "published": "2018-03-24T01:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11991, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "351bca2e60b31014f750344bfbf39526f3a8cdd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhoUfKj5XBIB0e93bAiGSp1MjxR8ZLyPDFUD0qTpO7g_T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T01:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "text": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission 1 2018-03-24 09:17 Xinhua Editor: Wang Fan ECNS App Download Zhao Leji (L), member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), attends the inauguration ceremony of China's national supervisory commission in Beijing, capital of China, March 23, 2018.
