Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo remained sat on the bench but it is safe to assume the jeers were in response to another unused substitute. Thousands of supporters had bought tickets on the strength of the promo pictures of Lionel Messi, back in town for the first time in 18 months, but Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli deprived many of a once in a lifetime opportunity. \nFriday night's meeting between the four-time and double World Cup winners still featured ample Premier League interest. Seven Argentinians and three Italians play in England, Nicolas Otamendi was starting in his own back yard, Angel di Maria was back in Manchester and there was also the odd transfer angle for those in the press box. \nNapoli's Brazil-born Azzurri midfielder Jorginho is interesting Liverpool and United, who view Jorginho as a potential replacement for Michael Carrick. It was another Italian midfielder who Mancunians marvelled at on their international evening. Twenty-three minutes in, Marco Verratti, collected the ball in line with his own six-yard box, danced past one Argentinian, then another and then one of his own teammates before he emerged from the Italian area. It was the closest fans got to seeing Messi. Read More United player ratings of the season so far \nThree years ago, Gary Neville awoke after watching Paris Saint-Germain eliminate Chelsea from the Champions League and succinctly said: \"Morning. Verratti - what a player! Thanks.\" \nMourinho will remember that night vividly. PSG's resolute performance is one of the standout 10-man showings in recent memory and Verratti's formidable 82-minute display should encourage United to touch base. \"Verratti bossed the midfield,\" Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry opined. \nUnited's Mino Raiola stable has halved in the last two months and he represents Verratti, whose Instagram post last summer excited gullible United supporters still celebrating the Romelu Lukaku coup. Verratti apologised for his previous agent Donato di Campli's behaviour and his change of representative in the transfer window was enough to make the player go viral. Or the agent, in Raiola's case. Verratti started for Italy with Jorginho \nRaiola trended on Twitter rather than Verratti and there are not many better holding players in world football than PSG's dynamic Italian. Verratti was never considered by United last summer as Mourinho focused on Premier League pedigree in Nemanja Matic or Eric Dier but the circumstances have changed. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku were all advised to join United over other clubs by their Italian-born agent and Raiola reputedly threw a chair in frustration during negotiations with Borussia Dortmund over Henrikh Mkhitaryan. \nThe furthest PSG have progressed in the Champions League under their Qatari-ownership is the quarter-finals and they reached that stage back in 2013. If ever, or whenever, they do lift the European Champion Clubs' Cup it will be a hollow, petrodollar achievement and the suspicion is some are getting impatient. Read More Two United players send a message to Jose Mourinho \nVerratti was petulantly sent off in their limp defeat to Real Madrid earlier this month and must be the most coveted of the 'old guard'. Verratti is one of three players listed in the quarter-final matchday squad against Barcelona still at the Parc des Princes. \nThis is the 25-year-old's sixth season in Paris and summer after summer he tops rival supporters' midfield wish-lists. If United are to sign an Italian midfielder to complement Matic and Paul Pogba then it should be Verratti rather than Jorginho, who has only hovered onto elite European clubs' radar in the current campaign. \nSigning Verratti would be another statement signing by United but a team focused one. After pipping Chelsea to Romelu Lukaku and using Real Madrid like pawns as Alvaro Morata was left by the road side, Verratti appeals as Barcelona barely conceal their desire to sign him. \nHe would also sell tickets. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.

BUT YOU HAVE TO SMILE AND CONTINUE.\" \nSanchez earlier admitted he has been disappointed with his performances for United so far. \n\"As I am self-demanding, I expected something better,\" Sanchez said. \n\"After my arrival at United, it was hard to change everything very quickly. I even hesitated to come here [to Sweden, with the national team]. \n\"I had asked permission to miss these games, but then I thought better and spoke with Claudio [Bravo] and told him that we should all be united. \n\"The change of club was something that was very abrupt - it was the first time I\u2019ve changed clubs in January - but many things have happened in my life that are difficult.\" \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.

The 21-year-old signed a new contract in October and has played 18 times this term. \nEven after his 'worst performance' against Brighton in the FA Cup quarter-final last week, McTominay was praised by Mourinho. \n\"You have the kid that didn't play well at all and I told him already,\" Mourinho said. \"Was the one I first spoke individually with in the dressing room, and instead of being critical with him I was positive with him. Because you play very bad but did the basic things that a player has to do and one of the basic things is to keep emotional balance. A fan asks Mourinho for a selfie \n\"To play with that red shirt - which is a heavy one, is a heavy shirt to wear - and the kid in his worst performance by far, he was there. He was not afraid to play, he played bad and every player can play bad. \n\"Scott played on his [Matic's] side, Scott played the worst match since he played with me in the first-team, but he is a Manchester United player for sure, because he's the player that made mistakes, passed the ball so bad tonight, lost so many passes. \n\"But big personality to cope with a mistake, big personality to say and to think I am not playing well but at least I will do the basic things of the game, which is to keep position, give balance to the team, recover balls, don't make defensive mistakes. But a few of the other guys were scared to play.\" Read More United might have already found their next number 10 \nMourinho has previously flown to Croatia, Austria and Sweden during international fortnights over the last year to watch prospective signings. The United manager flew to Croatia last year amid interest in winger Ivan Perisic and reportedly watched Red Bull Leipzig's Emil Forsberg play for Sweden against Italy in November. \nThe Portuguese watched Austria beat Serbia in an October World Cup qualifier that Nemanja Matic scored in. Midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who has been heavily linked with United, was not included in the Serbia squad. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.

She was there one minute and the next minute she was gone.\u201d \nSpeaking after the hearing, Mechelle said Maizy \u2018was just our everything\u2019. Maizy with mum Mechelle and nana Jean \nThe youngster first contracted the form of blood cancer in August 2012 when she was aged just 10, it was heard. \nShe was diagnosed after she complained of pain in her legs as she ran for the bus. \nAfter \u2018gruelling\u2019 chemotherapy and several years of follow-up treatment she was given the all-clear in January 2015. \nHowever, in December 2016, Maizy and her family got the devastating news that the disease had returned after she complained of feeling tired. Routine tests showed abnormalities in her blood. \nJust a month later she died after suddenly deteriorating whilst undergoing more chemotherapy in the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s hospital (RMCH), an inquest heard. \nShe suffered a second and fatal cardiac arrest after developing sepsis as a result of her illness, the hearing was told. Read More Maizy was granted her birthday wish to ride in a pink limousine \nCoroner Angharad Davies described her as a \u2018delightful young woman whose life was tragically cut short after she had shown such strength and determination in fighting back\u2019. \nDuring the inquest, the family questioned if the E-coli infection she was suffering from could have been spotted, and treated earlier, for example being moved onto the paediatric intensive care unit sooner than she was. Maizy Burke, 14, died following a battle with cancer in January 2017. (Image: Steve Marsland) \nAn internal investigation by the hospital trust into Maizy\u2019s death was carried out and consultant Dr Denise Bonny, who oversaw it, said the stretched resources and busy wards did sometimes impact on communication with patients\u2019 families. \nHowever, she said she believed \u2018all the right things were done at the right time\u2019 in respect of her treatment. \nMaizy has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer of the white blood cells which prevents the body fighting off other infections and viruses. \nAssistant coroner Angharad Davies ruled the decisions made by all the doctors and nurses caring for her were \u2018appropriate\u2019 given the information available to them. Maizy Burke celebrating her 14th birthday with friends \nRecording a conclusion Maizy died of natural causes Ms Davies said: \u201cMaizy\u2019s family have raised a number of issues that have caused them concern. \n\u201cIt seems to me the staff caring for Maizy had complex decisions to make and it was a balancing act. \n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t find any of those decisions were inappropriate. \n\u201cThere is no evidence earlier treatment would have changed or delayed the outcome for Maizy. \n\u201cYou have my very deepest sympathies about her death but also the devastating impact the circumstances, the fact she deteriorated so quickly, have had on you.\u201d Read More Primary school children paid an amazing tribute to former pupil Maizy Burke \nSpeaking after the hearing, Maizy\u2019s mum Mechelle, 49, said the entire family\u2019s world had been turned upside down. \nShe said: \u201cShe was just our everything. She loved singing, dancing. She was so popular, had so many friends. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a cruel disease. But just the day before she died she was sat up and talking to everyone. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the bit, especially her brother and sister, are struggling to come to terms with. \n\u201cI never thought she would die. She was so strong. \n\u201cWe\u2019re just devastated. Even now it doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d \nGot a story or an issue you want us to investigate?

By his own admission in a post for The Players' Tribune, he was 'almost f*cked' because he was so green and sheltered.\n\"I look back on the last 10 years of my career, and I've won the World Cup, the Champions League, \u200bLa Liga , Copa del Rey\u2026I've won it all, as I like to remind my Madrid friends on WhatsApp ,\" he said.\n\"But 10 years ago, I was almost f*cked. My whole life could have turned out very different if it wasn't for Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\"I arrived at \u200bManchester United a boy, and I left a man. It was a crazy time for me, because I had never been away from home before. I spent my first 17 years growing up in Spain in \u200bBarcelona 's youth academy, and it almost felt like I was playing for the local school team or something. I knew everybody there, and I was close to my family.\n\"To me, football was just fun. I didn't understand the business side of the game at all. Then I arrived at United, and honestly, it was a complete shock.\"\nHaving never played for the Bar\u00e7a first-team before he left home, Pique took his first steps in professional football at United, making his debut against lower league Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup and playing three times by the end of the 2004/05 season.\nPique returned to Spain on loan to play for Real Zaragoza in 2006/07, before playing 13 times as United completed a \u200bPremier League and Champions League double in 2007/08.\n\"Sir Alex was phenomenal to me from the very first day,\" he recalled.\n\"The best managers all have this quality - even when they're not playing you, and even when they're hard on you - they make you believe that they really care about you. Sir Alex was like a second father to me. He made me earn it, but eventually he gave me my chance.\"\nThe standards at United were incredibly high and it wasn't just Ferguson who upheld them, as Pique found out when, at the age of 18, he was berated by Roy Keane when his phone had rung in the dressing room before one of his very first games at Old Trafford.\n\"I was nervous as hell. Imagine it - I'm 18 years old, and I'm sitting in that little dressing room putting on my socks next to Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand. I wanted to be invisible. I was thinking, Just do your job and go unnoticed,\" Pique said.\n\"We're sitting there waiting for the gaffer to come in and speak to us, and I'm literally sitting right next to Roy Keane. The dressing room is so small that our legs are almost touching. There's no space at all. It's dead quiet. All of a sudden, you could hear this little vibration.\n\"I realise it's my phone. I left it on vibrate, and it's in the pocket of my pants, stuffed in the clothes bag that's hanging right behind Roy's head.\n\"Roy can't find where the noise is coming from. Now he's looking around the room like a maniac. His eyes are darting everywhere, and he's trying to figure it out. He looked like Jack Nicholson in The Shining, when he bursts through the door.\n\"He screams out to everybody, 'Whose phone is that?!' Silence. He asks again. Silence. He asks a third time. 'Whose. Bloody. F*cking. Phone. Is. That?!'\n\"Finally, I spoke up, like a little boy. Very softly, I said, 'I'm so sorry. It's mine. Roy lost his mind! He went nuts in front of everybody! It was incredible. I almost sh*t myself. But it was a good lesson.\n\"Now, in 2018, everything is different. All these kids are on their iPhones before the matches. But back then it was a different world. You didn't do that. Especially not at United. Not in Roy's dressing room. It was one of a thousand mistakes that I made when I was at United.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/manchester-united-kingdom-manchester-uniteds-gerard-pique-during-a-picture-id56246067?b=1&k=6&m=56246067&s=612x612&w=0&h=KPZ6BXmxLYSbDC5bF3gOjitYhsC3Xlfqc2u799xrk8M=", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/b9imdLRm-5zLWSWes.mp4", "https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/roy-keane-of-manchester-united-clashes-with-joey-barton-of-manchester-picture-id52236303?b=1&k=6&m=52236303&s=612x612&w=0&h=dY62966fHeVVlkrmjnUtiT3jD3E2t_j5cLw178OsRBY=", "http://content.jwplatform.com/players/b9imdLRm-j2R8uxba.html", "https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/shaun-harrad-of-burton-battles-with-gerrad-pique-of-man-utd-during-picture-id56542173?b=1&k=6&m=56542173&s=612x612&w=0&h=LSol88BzmupCf4Z20PvRzmbQ6z5lV7rDyD4jjcpADBI=", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lZP-E2b8R0?enablejsapi=1", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/b9imdLRm.m3u8"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gerard pique", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roy keane", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex ferguson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "la masia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "la liga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:29:32.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5606e19b99106eb176426ad84c49c296126ebf19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQC.rzm51SF8dFxll6EYxwTXOdfT7xlXKJR6VIyDiyXP4G3FN6kBrwiD7KiPJIIU_ycXz_XjFRLPqLe7aEZcMTCll.RPeTJhUkrlCMNeEEqOeMJof7yCYo7fHmgG5O.LIU.P10shFPJjg--", "site_full": "www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "site": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/?service=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "men - News", "title": "What the huge new transport plan means for you", "title_full": "What the huge new transport plan means for you", "published": "2018-03-23T21:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article12677478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS50586356.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 7505, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 364, "comments": 4, "shares": 364}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5606e19b99106eb176426ad84c49c296126ebf19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQC.rzm51SF8dFxll6EYxwTXOdfT7xlXKJR6VIyDiyXP4G3FN6kBrwiD7KiPJIIU_ycXz_XjFRLPqLe7aEZcMTCll.RPeTJhUkrlCMNeEEqOeMJof7yCYo7fHmgG5O.LIU.P10shFPJjg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paul Britton", "published": "2018-03-23T21:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "What the huge new transport plan means for you", "text": "News What the huge new transport plan means for you Metrolink services every six minutes on popular routes, 27 new trams, and \u00a3160m being invested in the region\u2019s cycling and walking infrastructures are part of the plans Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA six minute service could be introduced on more Metrolink lines - and more double trams will be put on to deal with jam-packed rush hour carriages. \nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has announced that 27 new trams will be added to the network in the next two years, boosting capacity by 25 per cent. \nIt will mean nearly 5,000 extra seats for passengers - and more double trams. \nAll lines currently run a 12-minute service. Where multiple services run along the same line, frequency is around six minutes between relevant stops. \nAt peak times, there is a six-minute service between Manchester and Bury; Manchester and Altrincham ; on the Eccles line as far as MediaCityUK; on the East Didsbury line; and from Rochdale via the Oldham line as far as Shaw and Crompton. (Image: Manchester Evening News) \nTransport bosses say the new trams - which will cost \u00a380m - will primarily be used to boost capacity when the network is at its busiest. \nThere is the potential this summer for current stock to extend the MediaCityUK to Etihad Stadium service to Ashton, providing a six-minute service on the Ashton line. \nThe extra trams are part of a huge \u00a3240m plan to cut congestion in Greater Manchester. \nMr Burnham hailed the investment as a \u2018major increase in capacity\u2019 and said extra security across the tram network would also be addressed, alongside \u2018more regular and frequent\u2019 services.

Andy Burnham (Image: Manchester Evening News) \nOutlining a range of new ideas and funding plans Mr Burnham said he wanted to \u2018unlock the potential for thousands of people to move around by cycling or walking without reliance on private car use\u2019. \nHe told the M.E.N.: \u201cPeople have experienced growing levels of congestion. There is nothing we can do to wave a magic wand. \n\u201cIt is a difficult issue but there are some things that we can do. We are setting out a new approach, one which is based on a deal with the public. \n\u201cThere are things that we can put in place, but they are intended to create incentives to change what people do - to move away from the car.\u201d \nThe money is coming from the Transforming Cities Fund, announced by the government last November. \nAll regions with a city mayor were told they would get cash. Greater Manchester has now been told what the money can be spent on. \nExact details are still being worked out and the plans are due to go before the region\u2019s combined authority next week. \nBut car sharing, the possible creation of a \u2018high occupancy vehicle lane\u2019 pilot scheme, giving priority to cars with three or more passengers on some of the busiest roads, are included. \nBusiness are also being urged to do their bit. Mr Burnham vowed to work with firms to encourage flexible working hours and starting times to stagger traditional rush hours and reduce bottlenecks. \nHe said a \u2018new package of incentives\u2019 would be explored, including offering workers at companies who sign up \u2018early bird\u2019 Metrolink discounts. No prices have been confirmed.

One idea is dedicated safe cycling routes to schools. \nOn Twitter Mr Boardman said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t just going to \u2018build infrastructure\u2019. We are going to build space people want to be in. Travel can be an enjoyable part of the day. We have forgotten that.\u201d (Image: MEN Media) \nThe investment covers \u2018walking infrastructure\u2019 and Mr Burnham said it could mean road lay-out changes, pavement alterations and new design strategies to boost pedestrian safety. \nA Manchester-wide scheme to improve junctions, tackle bottlenecks, build new roads and roll out \u2018smart\u2019 traffic signals is also planned, alongside reducing the impact of roadworks through better control, coordination and information. \nA 24/7 transport control centre would also be developed, to keep passengers up to date minute-by-minute across all forms of public transport, alongside a dedicated management team to govern and monitor some of Greater Manchester\u2019s busiest routes.
