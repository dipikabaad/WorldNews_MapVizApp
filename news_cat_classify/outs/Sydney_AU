Longest long-haul flights Auckland\u2014Dubai: 17 hours, 25 minutes Perth to London: 17 hours Dallas/Fort Worth\u2014Sydney: 16 hours, 55 minutes Johannesburg\u2014Atlanta: 16 hours, 50 minutes San Francisco\u2014Singapore: 16 hours, 30 minutes Abu Dhabi\u2014Los Angeles: 16 hours, 30 minutes \nWith Qantas launching its 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London this weekend, passengers are now facing one of the longest treks in commercial aviation. \nFlights of this length are not unheard of, with routes from Houston and Dallas to Sydney and direct services such as Los Angeles to Singapore and Auckland to Dubai already on offer for travellers wanting to trade a stopover or two for a direct service. \nAnd while the destinations might differ, the problems rarely do: how do you keep yourself feeling human after three-quarters of a day stuck in a metal tube. \nHere are some tips from the experts on how to cope with spending so long in a confined space. External Link: Nicolas Cage tastes sweet freedom after stepping off a plane in Con Air The doctor \nDry lips, nose, mouth and eyes \u2014 and don't forget the sometimes debilitating jetlag \u2014 are among the most common issues long-haul flyers can expect, according to travel doctor Sandy Dunne. \nBut she points to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot in the leg veins, as the thing flyers should be most mindful of. \nDr Dunne said some people were at higher risk of DVT, including: People who have had DVT previously Women who are pregnant or on female hormone replacement therapy Individuals who are either very tall or short, as well as obese people People who have had recent surgery, or anyone unable to walk around during a flight Photo: Qantas says seats in the economy cabin are roomier. (Supplied: Qantas) \nShe recommends that anyone who is at heightened risk consult a travel doctor ahead of their flight. \nDr Dunne said travellers should ensure they stay well hydrated, and take practical steps to minimise the impact of dryness, such as packing lip balm and eye drops. \nShe strongly advises against using sleeping pills on flights. \n\"If you are drugged out on a sleeping tablet you can stay in one position for a long time and that can increase your risk of DVT,\" she said. The psychologist \nEnvironmental psychologist Rob Hall said airports and, by extension, planes could be places that drew strong emotional responses from people, especially those who were anxious about flying or who were leaving loved ones behind. \nDr Hall said the ultra long-haul experience could take its own particular toll on people, with time disorientation, fatigue, irritability and even the disruption of a person's rhythm of going to the bathroom potentially affecting a passenger's emotional state. Photo: Business class and premium economy seats take up more than half the plane between them. (Supplied: Qantas) \nHe said it was important people find something to keep their mind occupied and find a way to keep moving, even through in-seat exercises \u2014 for which many airlines provide 'how-to' guides. \n\"If you are going on a very long flight, it is worth having a little mental checklist and saying, 'OK, at least once an hour I'll do all these waggly exercises, I'll stand up and maybe walk up and down the aisle once or twice',\" Dr Hall said. \n\"They help you to burn off a bit of muscular energy \u2026 and they protect you from things like deep vein thrombosis.\" The pilot \nCaptain Brad Hodson, Australian and International Pilots Association acting president, said passengers not knowing what to expect might actually be surprised by how quickly time could pass on a long-haul flight. Photo: Captain Brad Hodson says a bit of respect goes a long way on a long flight. (Supplied: AIPA) \n\"You just have to turn up pretty well rested, drink a lot of water, try not to drink too much alcohol and try to sleep when you can,\" he said. \nCaptain Hodson said with the passengers stuck in the same space for so long, treating each other well was important for ensuring a smooth experience. \n\"Obviously people will want to get up and stretch their legs and that sort of thing, so it will take a bit of respect for each other to ensure that functions reasonably well,\" he said. \n\"Most of the people who will do this flight are probably seasoned travellers, and will do it because it gets them to their destination quicker than they otherwise would have [on an indirect route].\" \nLong-haul routes such as Perth to London are made more manageable for crews with the presence of four pilots on the aircraft, allowing two at a time extended rest periods in designated sleeping areas. \n\"You are able to sleep in them a lot better than you would in a business class seat because they are quieter, they are more comfortable,\" Captain Hodson said.

(Supplied: Qantas) The airline \nQantas claims it has made the long-haul flight more pleasant for travellers by offering a more spacious cabin, with 236 seats on its Boeing 787-9 aircraft \u2014 as opposed to the more than 300 seats squeezed in by other airlines. \nBut the airline also had to take fuel capacity into account when deciding how many passengers and how much luggage the aircraft could carry over such a long distance. \nMuch of the lower density is because of the high number of business class and premium economy seats Qantas has opted for \u2014 with those cabins taking up more than half the plane between them. External Link: More than half the Qantas 787s are business and first class \nBut the airline has also promised a \"roomier\" economy seat. \nQantas itself recommends wearing comfortable clothing, charging personal electronic devices in advance and bringing your own snacks and basic plane-friendly toiletries to make a long-haul trip more enjoyable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "qantas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas/fort worth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:30:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d526412302d8dc4030a4290617e4f8886a46532", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhph_1zL9Q0_gDiNeYrgLVfDWCDrZloi80toC0CWL9JV78eQiebDjxLQeP4vRDky18phvGH3och2WOUS9Grhga94svfYs7ySnOWZZrn9AetCFcNnchroONvswe8Xlk8n._KAYt9NwF2_6nesQLzIEaSY-", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.brisbanetimes.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Brisbane Times - Latest News", "title": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "title_full": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "published": "2018-03-23T17:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_auto/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/2500826b2f78fbd6d61504147152e65208ed7a53", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3806, "comments": 0, "shares": 3806}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d526412302d8dc4030a4290617e4f8886a46532", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhph_1zL9Q0_gDiNeYrgLVfDWCDrZloi80toC0CWL9JV78eQiebDjxLQeP4vRDky18phvGH3och2WOUS9Grhga94svfYs7ySnOWZZrn9AetCFcNnchroONvswe8Xlk8n._KAYt9NwF2_6nesQLzIEaSY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deborah Snow", "published": "2018-03-23T17:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "text": "By Deborah Snow 24 March 2018 \u2014 1:07am Former US president Barack Obama has warned against complacency in taking the benefits of liberal democracies for granted, saying rights like freedom of speech, freedom of association, protection of minorities and the rule of law have to be fought for and defended, sources say.\nIn a speech that drew a standing ovation from guests at a private dinner at the Art Gallery of New South Wales on Friday night, Mr Obama said he was by nature a congenital optimist, not an alarmist.

His integrity and determination to do what was right cost him his job at the next election, but it saved lives.\nSince then, there have been zero \u2013 that\u2019s right, zero \u2013 mass shootings in Australia. Please don\u2019t let anyone from the NRA tell you that Australia is a \"special case\" or that prior to Port Arthur there were no massacres. Before the National Firearms Agreement, there had been a mass shooting (defined as four or more victims) every year for the preceding 13 years. Gun control works.\nMourners hold flowers during the funeral for Peter Wang, who was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\nPhoto: AP But, as I said earlier, this letter is not written with self-righteousness; it is filled with foreboding.\nIn the last 20 years, according to a 2017 report by Sydney University, every Australian state has weakened its firearms legislation. Those hard-fought laws that most Australians believe are set in stone, including restrictions on semi-automatic weapons, have been watered down by today\u2019s politicians. These politicians are betraying our futures, our freedoms and inviting mass killing.\nLoading It is for this reason that I am writing to the next generation of leaders, encouraging you to build and maintain the rage against political self-interest, complacency and lies - or as Emma Gonzalez, a Parkland survivor so eloquently described it, their \u201cBS\u201d.\nThe time is now for students around the world to stand together; to demand laws that prevent the deaths of our friends, our families, our fellow students; to demand our right to go to school and to expect to come home; to demand our right to grow into adults and into better leaders; to demand that those elected serve and protect us.\nIn America, your politicians hide behind your Second Amendment rights. In Australia, they use back-room deals and late night parliamentary sessions to weaken our laws.\nThe questions are few and simple: what is more important, Second Amendment rights, written more than 230 years ago, or the right to life in America? In Australia, are the lives of citizens more important than political careers? Those questions are not rhetorical. And that is a terrifying truth.\nJason Cleary-Gorton is in year 12 at St Andrew's Cathedral School, Sydney.\nLicense this article Guns Opinion USA Comments disabled Morning & Afternoon Newsletter Delivered Mon\u2013Fri.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason cleary-gorton", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "alex ellinghausen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makenzie hymes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marjory stoneman douglas high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T16:08:41.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d66378168ce5572194e8ff0e5fca26c68689950", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQLTWP.uPD5ClDz_x6LOzrelAB2Hga5Jerf5vxPKIpTG8oL.BqlFjYbKsO4aWFtF_PmAgTU_K5Wf0Bb6R3ZcMa1247y.z68vE-", "site_full": "www.sbs.com.au", "site": "sbs.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.sbs.com.au/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "french_cuisine"], "section_title": "Top Stories", "title": "Anti-coal protesters take to the streets in Sydney", "title_full": "Anti-coal protesters take to the streets in Sydney", "published": "2018-03-24T06:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sl.sbs.com.au/public/image/file/f10776df-ef45-4154-bc30-0b6268d4e50b/crop/16x9", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 6605, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1192, "comments": 0, "shares": 1192}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d66378168ce5572194e8ff0e5fca26c68689950", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQLTWP.uPD5ClDz_x6LOzrelAB2Hga5Jerf5vxPKIpTG8oL.BqlFjYbKsO4aWFtF_PmAgTU_K5Wf0Bb6R3ZcMa1247y.z68vE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T06:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anti-coal protesters take to the streets in Sydney", "text": "  Anti-coal protesters take to the streets in Sydney Play NSW farmers, traditional owners and activists have marched in Sydney to urge the government to choose environmental sustainability over coal mining. Updated Updated 11 hours ago \nFarmers on horseback, anti-mining activists and traditional owners have descended upon Sydney's CBD with a message to the NSW government - choose environmental sustainability over coal. \nThe five thousand protesters hailed from different corners of the state, some have seen the effects of climate change on their farms firsthand, others have been displaced by surrounding coal mines. \nGlenn Morris, who made headlines in 2016 after riding his horse Hombre across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to raise awareness about climate change, was one of 25 farmers on horseback. \n\"There is devastation because of climate change all across NSW,\" the Inverell farmer told AAP. \n\"We can't afford to destroy any more healthy land.\" \nHe says crop reduction, dry land and a loss in pasture growth are already being felt across the agricultural community, and warned if the temperatures get any warmer \"we've lost the game\". \nHe called for a ban on coal seam gas and mining in order to prioritise sustainability. \nGomeroi man Raymond Weatherall said Aboriginal people shouldn't have to trade their land and cultural heritage for mining jobs. Indigenous activists joined the Sydney anti-coal protests. AAP \n\"Our culture is our life and we need to protect it from coal and gas mining for our kids' sake,\" he said. \nLock the Gate Alliance spokeswoman Georgina Woods said the rally brought Sydneysiders together with farmers from Coonamble, the Hunter, Northern Rivers, Southern Highlands and Liverpool Plains. \nThe rally sent a message to the state's politicians ahead of the 2019 NSW election, she said. \n\"(It) puts all political parties on notice that protecting the countryside from coal and gas, and repowering NSW with renewable energy will be pivotal issues in the coming year,\" she told AAP. Farmer Glenn Morris takes to the streets of Sydney on horseback in protest at mining. \nNature Conservation Council Chief executive Kate Smolski said NSW has one of the most coal-dependent energy systems in the world. \n\"Meanwhile, the Berejiklian government is squandering a clean-energy jobs and investment bonanza and failing to tackle climate change,\" she said. \n\"The transition from coal and gas to solar, wind and storage will attract $25 billion of investment, the construction of about 2500 wind turbines and installation of more 42 million solar panels across the state.\" Source: AAP - SBS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "glenn morris", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aap nsw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sydney   australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney harbour bridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T07:23:40.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c25a5281582563da40d42371d3f8ad30422de3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhph_1zL9Q0_gDiNeYrgLVfCWt6zlIHcWZs5W75U0fzwrY1D3mdlhazGaCWTqO75j7vPCoqUC5oJfTtAonAZ1s.4aVM3prFICNDbBiD1SL5QT5lHOGVt.KgrTHkuxsbPJl1fdEHUfuHlCWKMHN2oByCla0xknQiGB4w--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.brisbanetimes.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Brisbane Times - Latest News", "title": "Saving Detective Breda: surgery team who brought officer back from death", "title_full": "Saving Detective Breda: surgery team who brought officer back from death", "published": "2018-03-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_auto/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/a9c7d99223a30b1d8f26d0109b0aeb47f1cf4be7", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4792, "comments": 0, "shares": 4792}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c25a5281582563da40d42371d3f8ad30422de3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhph_1zL9Q0_gDiNeYrgLVfCWt6zlIHcWZs5W75U0fzwrY1D3mdlhazGaCWTqO75j7vPCoqUC5oJfTtAonAZ1s.4aVM3prFICNDbBiD1SL5QT5lHOGVt.KgrTHkuxsbPJl1fdEHUfuHlCWKMHN2oByCla0xknQiGB4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lucy Cormack", "published": "2018-03-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Detective Breda: surgery team who brought officer back from death", "text": "Saving Detective Breda: surgery team who brought officer back from death By Lucy Cormack Dr Emily Granger. Photo: Jessica Hromas Hurtling through the Lane Cove tunnel late in the afternoon on Australia Day, Dr Emily Granger was almost willing herself to get a speeding ticket. \u201cAt the time I actually hoped I would see a police car so I could wave them down and they could drive me in even faster.\u201d The cardiothoracic surgeon never saw a police car and she won\u2019t say what speed she was travelling at in her white SUV Discovery. But after the phone call she had just received, time was of the essence. \u201cI had just gotten home from the pool with the kids, when my registrar called saying a policeman had been stabbed ... and he looked like he was about to die,\u201d she said. Injured in the course of duty: Detective Sergeant John Breda. Advertisement The attack The policeman was top NSW Detective Sergeant John Breda and his injuries were catastrophic. Detective Sergeant Breda, 45, was stabbed during the attempted arrest of an alleged paedophile at a pub in Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs. The decorated officer and two colleagues from the child abuse squad entered the Maroubra Junction Hotel pub about 3.15pm, where they planned to arrest 33-year-old Nick Newman. Mr Newman was being sought by police after he failed to attend Penrith Court two days earlier to face multiple charges, which reportedly included several counts of sexual assault. The 33-year-old is believed to have known he was wanted by police regarding a series of child sex charges. In dramatic scenes, Detective Sergeant Breda was stabbed multiple times by Mr Newman in the beer garden of the pub, where he suffered severe chest and abdominal wounds. Witness Brett Douglas was close by in the hotel and was the first to render first aid to the policeman as he lay bleeding heavily next to his attacker. Mr Douglas said the detective remained conscious while waiting for an ambulance, even going so far as to direct his own first aid treatment by requesting more pressure to the site of the stab wound. Mr Newman, from Penrith, was shot dead by two other officers, after he lunged at Detective Sergeant Breda. The long-standing officer is a popular and highly respected member of the child abuse squad, and previously worked in the Middle Eastern crime squad. Injury designed to kill \u201cIt was an injury designed to kill,\u201d Dr Granger said of the wound inflicted with a 15-centimetre combat blade.\u201cIt had gone through the side of him, through the kidney, through the liver, through his diaphragm and up into his lungs. The entire blade had been inserted to the hilt.\u201d The blood bags used to save Detective Sergeant Breda. An average adult male of Detective Sergeant Breda\u2019s stature has five to six litres of blood circulating in his body. Over the course of the next six hours, the 45-year-old would lose his entire blood count three times; sending up to 15 litres of blood gurgling down the drain. Ask any of the doctors present that day how many people helped save the life of Detective Sergeant Breda and they will struggle to give the exact number. There were the paramedics who were first to reach him at the pub and brought him to St Vincent\u2019s emergency department. There was the department\u2019s public holiday skeleton staff who stabilised and transferred him to the operating theatre, while he remained conscious, in just under 20 minutes. All this was before the arrival of four surgeons, two anaesthetists, their nurses and registrars, the hospital\u2019s blood bank and the haematology department. There also were the breathless porters who ran units of blood to the theatre in a desperate effort to keep pace with the rapid blood loss. \u201cWhen I arrived [the registrars] were opening the abdomen and there was basically blood pouring out of his belly, so I knew we were going to be in trouble,\u201d Dr Granger said. \u201cThe patient was in trouble.\u201d That Friday afternoon Dr Roma Steele was the general on-call anaesthetist at St Vincent\u2019s when she received word of the stabbing. \u201cI was actually just about to leave ... then there was a trauma call in the hospital and they asked if I could come down. Often we get these calls and they are false alarms,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was immediately obvious this was no false alarm.\u201d Anaethetist Andrew Jackson. Dr Steele was joined by fellow anaesthetist Dr Andrew Jackson, who specialises in heart surgery and is used to dealing with heavy blood loss. \u201cI arrived probably about half an hour after the patient arrived. There were police swarming everywhere and lots of press already, so I knew it was a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cFor about two hours we pretty much had uncontrollable bleeding despite various best efforts. This was a time where blood transfusion really did save someone's life.\u201d Dr Jackson recalls administering 10 milligrams of adrenalin just to prevent Detective Sergeant Breda from slipping into cardiac arrest, describing it as an \u201cenormous dose\u201d. \u201cNormally you give about one milligram and that\u2019s if there actually is a cardiac arrest.\u201d The role of an anaesthetist in any surgery is to stimulate the body\u2019s functions while a patient is unconscious. That means administering oxygen, ventilating lungs, administering new blood and managing cardiovascular blood volume and function. \u201cWhen you give a lot of blood products you tend to get lots of calcium, so during surgery we are constantly taking blood samples, giving different drugs until it goes back to normal,\u201d Dr Jackson said. The mood lifts As they gradually stemmed the blood loss, and fixed the lacerations in the officer\u2019s diaphragm and lung, things were looking up. Dr Steele remembers \u201cthe mood in the room lifting\u201d. \u201cInitially they were pretty happy with what went on,\u201d said general surgeon Dr Rohan Getts, whose surgical registrar had been keeping him up to speed over the phone. \u201cBut then he rang me to come in ... the kidney was unstable, although he had tried to put in stitches, the bleeding wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d The laceration to the kidney was causing blood to escape through the bladder. By the time Dr Getts arrived, the bladder was so full of blood it was \u201cthe size of a football\u201d. It should be the size of a walnut. The surgical team had now determined that the officer\u2019s kidney had effectively been cut in half by the knife and there was no chance of stitching it closed. They called for urologist Dr Raji Kooner and vascular and trauma surgeon Dr Tony Grabs. \u201cAt this stage we were up 10 litres of blood loss. It was quite shocking really, I phoned Tony and said, we need you here now. You just need to get in however you can, this guy is about to die and he needs his kidney out,\u201d said Dr Granger. \u201cIt was very difficult accessing the kidney from the right side, we needed a special trauma approach. As soon as Grabs walked in I grabbed the saw and opened his chest.\u201d Dr Kooner has seen a lot kidneys in his time, but he said Detective Sergeant Breda\u2019s was one he was unlikely to forget. \u201cI\u2019ve been working 20 years ... done quite a few traumas, but this for me \u2026 it affected me quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was at home with my four kids, watching the TV and I saw a news flash about a policeman who had been stabbed. So that stuck on my mind, but I didn\u2019t really think that would be something I\u2019d be involved with.\u201d He can\u2019t say why, but Dr Kooner decided to go to the hospital, just in case, a fateful decision that meant he was just 30 seconds down the corridor when the call actually came through. The team: Dr Emily Granger, Dr Rohan Gett, (behind) Dr Raji Kooner, Professor Anthony Grabs, Andrew Jackson, and Romaa Steele, Photo: Jessica Hromas Situation turns dire \u201cThere is a main vein to the body, called the inferior vena cava, which takes most of the blood from the body back to the heart, and that is joined to the kidney. But it was impossible to identify that because of how much blood there was swelling up,\u201d Dr Kooner said. \u201cThe concern was if we went in there to take out the kidney ... we could tear his vena cava ... so the situation was quite dire.\u201d With all hands on deck the team was able to control the bleeding, however \u201ca few more minutes and things may have been a bit different'', Dr Kooner said. Almost two months to the day of the stabbing, the decorated officer has been praised repeatedly by his medical team for his \u201cincredible\u201d progress, starting rehabilitation just four days after the incident and his mammoth six-hour surgery.

Photo: Supplied Strong patient \u201cWe were very lucky we had a patient as strong as John,\u201d said Dr Granger, \u201cphysically and mentally.\u201d The cardiothoracic surgeon, whose patients are usually around 80 years of age, still remarks on his \u201cyoung, solid bones and excellent quality tissue''. She said a case like Detective Sergeant Breda\u2019s did not come along often. But when they did, it was a privilege to get the call. \u201cThese guys put their bodies and their lives on the line,'' she said. ''I may get a speeding ticket to get to them, but it\u2019ll be worth every cent.\u201d NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said: \u201cI have been following John\u2019s progress closely and I look forward to welcoming him back to work when he is ready. \u201cHis strength and commitment to recovery is inspiring to all those around him.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "breda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lucy cormack", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "emily granger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john breda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "lane cove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern suburbs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T16:19:29.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c647f8ad89a1fa9e2316d31b61120de7dc07bbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i8iM_o40ytZUF_U6odvXDetZqa_FmsL09v0Ev5UlJozZnB4HGu1zT3rTI_DhIXkoIODmAsV6whO5Q--", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "'Kids should feel safe at school': Australian students call for US gun control", "title_full": "'Kids should feel safe at school': Australian students call for US gun control", "published": "2018-03-24T06:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9583194-16x9-700x394.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3042, "comments": 0, "shares": 3042}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c647f8ad89a1fa9e2316d31b61120de7dc07bbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i8iM_o40ytZUF_U6odvXDetZqa_FmsL09v0Ev5UlJozZnB4HGu1zT3rTI_DhIXkoIODmAsV6whO5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lily Mayers", "published": "2018-03-24T06:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Kids should feel safe at school': Australian students call for US gun control", "text": "Map: Sydney 2000 \nThey may be halfway across the world from the gun violence happening in American schools, but a group of Sydney students are passionate about tighter gun control in the United States. \n\"We can't just sit in our living room and grumble about stuff, we have to get out there and do it and we think that's very important,\" said one student from Dulwich Hill Primary School.

We've now got a little bit of APY in Sydney city,\" she said speaking through a translator. \n\"One of the great things about having this space is that now we're showing the world out culture, a little bit about it.\" \nAnother director, Peter Mungkuri, said the new gallery would provide opportunities for younger artists in the APY Lands. \n\"For all our young emerging artists and also our young people in our communities, this space is for them. It's about them being able to learn,\" he said. \nAnother famous artist from the APY Lands, Yaritji Young, said having more control over how her work was sold would benefit her family. \n\"We always get upset when we see only a little bit of money for our painting. But now we want to see everything better, we want to get the money back for our grandkids.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbara moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven schubert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mimili maku arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern territory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darlinghurst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T06:42:25.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbf07ab69e1a9ed04f3dc2149c7f8488db6c19ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd90bXkqPh54QdGbtABxLXoGqSP.n_NIzV40wOg8u4rGjjMP0ZlVDizEODzlbEJ.M5OJXPDGkvPVgIihO9k74j.JGgp9QUX65zE5Nilf8_sOUm4aScUjdUoE56tojMCmRaQ--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.watoday.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WAToday RSS News Headlines", "title": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "title_full": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "published": "2018-03-24T01:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.watoday.com.au/content/dam/images/h/0/x/w/f/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.p4z60c.png/1521814149210.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3806, "comments": 0, "shares": 3806}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbf07ab69e1a9ed04f3dc2149c7f8488db6c19ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TsV4X5W3xd90bXkqPh54QdGbtABxLXoGqSP.n_NIzV40wOg8u4rGjjMP0ZlVDizEODzlbEJ.M5OJXPDGkvPVgIihO9k74j.JGgp9QUX65zE5Nilf8_sOUm4aScUjdUoE56tojMCmRaQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deborah Snow", "published": "2018-03-24T01:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "'He is gifted': Obama draws standing ovation at Art Gallery of NSW", "text": "Man jailed for 21 for 'brutal' inner west ...

Courtesy Seven Network. \nHe said social and political structures had not yet worked out how to deal with rapidly changing communications technology, a world in which people no longer watched the same TV channels or read the same newspapers. The rapid pace of change was having a flow-on effect across the globe, and was likely to get faster still. Discourse was becoming increasingly fragmented, with people becoming hermetically sealed off from each other inside very different information universes. \u201cIf I watched Fox News, I wouldn\u2019t vote for me\u201d he joked. \nSources at the exclusive, invitation-only dinner, said he spoke of seeing a hunger for things and information that could bring people together. And he highlighted the need for \u201cmany voices around the table\u201d to solve the problems facing the globe. Rarely did he see a problem as president that couldn't be solved for technical reasons, he said. It was \u201cbarriers between people\u201d that stopped things being fixed.
