Projects must have a: \na) Start date c) Initial investment estimate Data \nFor state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. \nIf original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. \nIn cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. \nIn the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. \nIn judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. \nBest care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. \nThe greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. \nNo attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation \nIn the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency \nProjects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report. Severity of deviation from original estimates \nThe severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria.
