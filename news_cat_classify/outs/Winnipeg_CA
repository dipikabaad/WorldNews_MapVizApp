She uses her teeth to create tiny impressions in the bark. Once unfolded, a symmetrical design is revealed.\nThe self-taught artist had her first encounter with birch bark biting nearly 30 years ago when she saw the work of Angelique Merasty, another Manitoba birch bark biter. She became curious and eventually found herself sifting through a neighbour's woodpile looking for her canvas.\nOne of Pat Bruderer's pieces of birch bark is held up to the light to reveal intricate details made by biting the folded bark. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\"I started to practise, I started to get better and better at it, and my goal was to teach as many children as I could, because I always wanted other children and my children to always know what it was,\" the mother of five said.\nBorn in Churchill, Man., and believed to be one of only a few birch bark biters in North America, Bruderer's work is displayed in galleries and museums around the world. She's made a living from her art, but also makes a point of passing on her knowledge.\n\"I want other children besides my own to know what this is and that it never becomes a lost art,\" said Bruderer, whose traditional name is Half Moon Woman.\n\"So many of our traditions, and so much of our culture, was lost because of residential schools and colonization that it's really important to pass these traditions on.\"\nGrade 1 student Tirth Patel tried birch bark biting for the first time and created a sun-shaped stamp in the bark. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\nThe Cree artist says birch bark has been used by Indigenous peoples to build canoes, harvest birch water, and to wrap both babies and the dead.\nAn art form normally practised by women, birch bark biting dates back centuries in Indigenous communities across Canada.\nOakenwald principal Tanis Thiessen has been trying to secure a session with Bruderer since she first learned about her work four years ago.\n\"It's amazing how we've been able to have her for three full days, when there's literally only a handful of people in the world who can pass on this knowledge,\" said Thiessen.\nMultidisciplinary art\nAll of the nearly 200 students at the Crescent Park-area school got the chance to learn about the tradition and try it for themselves.\n\"They're hesitant at first, they're looking at it and saying, 'I bite this?' and they're wondering how it's going to taste,\" said Thiessen.\nShe said each age group and student takes something different from the lesson because the art form covers a lot of ground.\n\"It's bringing in math and science and language arts, because of all the storytelling and the culture that she's got surrounding all of it,\" she said.\nBruderer says the earlier children learn the skill, the better they become at more contemporary subjects.\nBirch bark biting creates intricate symmetrical designs using just the artist's teeth to make tiny impressions. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\"The sooner you know how to do birch bark biting, the better you'll do in math and science and architecture.\"\nBruderer says bark biting encourages students to use spatial reasoning, and to use their imaginations as they think about what they want to create.\n\"It's really neat to see the kids that have little or no confidence \u2026 be able to create a piece, because when they open it their whole face just lights up.\"\nElementary school students learn Cree art of birch bark biting 2:06\nShe says the bark also has medicinal properties in its light powdery coating, and the practice of biting can be therapeutic.\n\"It takes your mind off everything. You can't think about anything except for what you are creating, so any problems you have or whatever just goes away, so it is very healing for people,\" said Bruderer.\n\"Birch bark bitings are like people \u2014 they're beautiful and there's no two the same.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cree", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bruderer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly caruk/cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat bruderer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angelique merasty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oakenwald school", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manitoba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:25:48.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a24cbf2aa68090c7e7be464cbcc01ef1b5868e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr24IfhLKknNtyQkdIynAYR1LryTB39iYo5OBteNcmKR_dlfrvUoT8_e16YN_jVxvmoc68wWCpsE_NA--", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-manitoba.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Province to build first-ever highway roundabout in Manitoba", "title_full": "Province to build first-ever highway roundabout in Manitoba", "published": "2018-03-22T19:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.958, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4588066.1521736489!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/intersection.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 994, "comments": 0, "shares": 994}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a24cbf2aa68090c7e7be464cbcc01ef1b5868e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr24IfhLKknNtyQkdIynAYR1LryTB39iYo5OBteNcmKR_dlfrvUoT8_e16YN_jVxvmoc68wWCpsE_NA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc", "published": "2018-03-22T19:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Province to build first-ever highway roundabout in Manitoba", "text": "A highway intersection southwest of Winnipeg that sees about 10,000 vehicles a day \u2014 and has seen many collisions in recent years \u2014 is about to get its stop signs replaced by a roundabout.\nThe first-ever roundabout on a Manitoba highway will be located where highways 2 and 3 meet near Oak Bluff, just outside Winnipeg's southwest perimeter.\n\"This has been a very troubling intersection for us as a province,\" said Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler. \"There are a lot of accidents at this intersection and the volume of traffic has created long lines as well as unsafe merging and crossings.\"\nThe Manitoba government is proposing construction of a roundabout at the intersection of Highway 2 and Highway 3 near Oak Bluff.

Part of her job, she said, is to build that relationship between students and teachers. She often hears from students that they think their teachers don't care.\nIgnoring Indigenous culture leads to classroom disconnect \"Just understanding what students are going through\" is important, she said. \"Maybe there is something happening in their life, the loss of a loved one.\"\nStephanie Midford is the Aboriginal graduation coach at St. John's High School. (Jaison Empson/CBC)\nShe hopes students and teachers will have conversations about those those issues, \"to understand where that student is coming from and then help support the teacher to realize OK, they're not just skipping, they're not doing this on purpose.\"\nThe other part of Midford's job is helping Indigenous students get their high school diplomas.\nShe said many have barriers at home that impact their school life. \"Aspects are mental health, addictions in families, attendance, students are having to take care of their younger sibling if their family has to go to work \u2014 someone has to be at home if there is no daycare provided.\"\nMidford said these are things she sees every day in the halls of St. John's. She keeps an open door for students who need to talk with her, or who need help talking with their teachers about what's going on in their lives. She also connects with their families to involve them in the education process.\nShe's in her second year in the role, and said she's already seen improvements around attendance, and engagement in studies and extracurricular activities.\nSuccess stories Raeden Bricklin is a prime example. At the beginning of the year, the 19-year-old's plan was to get his mature student diploma this year. With help from Midford, he will be graduating with a regular high school diploma alongside his peers in June.\n\"I worked extra hard, stayed home, up all night doing homework, reading my books. The work paid off in the end,\" he said.\nRaeden Bricklin, 19, worked with the Aboriginal graduation coach at St. John's High School to get on track to graduate in June. 'The work paid off in the end,' he says. (Jaison Empson/ CBC)\nBricklin said he didn't put effort into his first two years of high school. He said it was only after he got arrested that he started trying in class.\n\"I was on probation, so I just went to school and I actually liked coming to school and learning, educating myself, and my culture too,\" he said.\n'They just believe in you': Indigenous students' graduation rate soars by 41% at Calgary Catholic schools He's also part of the Aboriginal Youth Leadership Team and was involved in the United Way presentation with Keep and Mousseau. Since getting involved with the team, he's gone to three sweats and learned to build a teepee \u2014 experiences he said are important to him.\nBricklin wasn't convicted after his arrest, and said he's happy his mistakes as a teen won't follow him into his future as he applies for university.\nHe plans on studying kinesiology and getting an education degree to become a physical education teacher.\nPerhaps most importantly, Midford said he's a role model for his younger brother, who is in his first year of high school.\n\"He wants to lead the way,\" she said. \"He's very determined, he's had such great mentors, like his coaches, his teachers \u2014 they're all pushing him and providing opportunities for him to be successful and he sees that.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john'", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "liam keep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cormier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st. john's high school", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "aboriginal youth leadership program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north end school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united way", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:26:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cd425420cb948e39ed3890d06551e348ebbb1c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr26EOM9Gu5YDnEaLhC67Djjf4Z.0EafWjBYylrrKnQuD1paNqavZM2agW9iQVrtZ9qA-", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-manitoba.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Car crashes and rolls into Winnipeg firehall", "title_full": "Car crashes and rolls into Winnipeg firehall", "published": "2018-03-23T14:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4589411.1521804656!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/car-crashes-into-firehall.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 435, "comments": 0, "shares": 435}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cd425420cb948e39ed3890d06551e348ebbb1c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr26EOM9Gu5YDnEaLhC67Djjf4Z.0EafWjBYylrrKnQuD1paNqavZM2agW9iQVrtZ9qA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc", "published": "2018-03-23T14:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Car crashes and rolls into Winnipeg firehall", "text": "  23, 2018 6:59 AM CT Last Updated: Mar 23, 2018 6:59 AM CT A car lies on its side after crashing into Firehall No. 9 on Marion Street on Friday morning.
