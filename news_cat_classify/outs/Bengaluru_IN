According to a report by news agency PTI, the 29-year old will miss Afghanistan\u2019s historic Test debut in Bengaluru from June 14 and instead travel to south of London after the conclusion of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018 season. Should Kohli play in England, Ajinkya Rahane is believed to step in as skipper. \n\u201cVirat (Kohli) will be playing for a division one county side for sure. I wouldn\u2019t like to add anything more to it. There were talks with Surrey and Essex,\u201d a senior BCCI official was quoted as saying by PTI. \nThe decision to let Test specialists play in England was taken following India\u2019s 1-2 defeat against South Africa wher the team management admitted they should have prepared better for the series. \u201cThis time we have been pro-active because post the South Africa experience we felt that exposure was essential for the team,\u201d Vinod Rai, the chairman of the committee of administrators, the body governing the BCCI, told ESPNcricinfo . \u201cSo we have given him and other Test specialists permission to play in county cricket.\u201d \nRai further added that few pther Test spsecialists would be part of the India A squad, coached by Rahul Dravid , who will play two four-day matches in England in June. The decision was made in consultation with head coach Ravi Shastri, Dravid, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, and Saba Karim (BCCI\u2019s general manager of cricket) along with Kohli. \nThe report adds that the decision has been taken by the Indian captain in a bid to improve his batting in England, where he has not been able to perform at his best. Kohli has played five Tests in the country and has managed to score only 134 runs at an average of 13.4. If the reports are true, the right-hand batsman will become the first Indian to join Surrey, who have hosted some of the legends over the years. Virat Kohli \u2018s decision to play county cricket before the England series shows his drive and commitment to achieve excellence. I am sure not only him,but Team India will do exceedingly well in the England series. Best wishes! \n\u2014 VVS Laxman (@VVSLaxman281) March 24, 2018 \nThe report says that Kohli will make himself available for Surrey\u2019s three four-day matches against Hampshire, Somerset and Yorkshire between June 9 and June 28. Virat Kohli has made a strong statement of intent about the England tour where he has unfinished business by opting to play county cricket. In doing so, has also prioritised opposition by missing the test against Afghanistan \n\u2014 Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) 24 March 2018 \nHe will not be alone in playing county cricket to ready himself for the England tour. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishant Sharma , who went unsold this year at the IPL Auction, will also play the upcoming season of the county championship for Yorkshire and Sussex, respectively, starting April 7. \nREAD | Cheteshwar Pujara to play for Yorkshire in English County cricket \nSurrey\u2019s director and former England wicketkeeper Alec Stewart has shown keen interest in signing the prolific batsman. \u201cI did enquire a while back about Kohli when it appeared to be a possible option for him to play county cricket but was told India were playing Ireland in T20s and an inaugural Test against Afghanistan in June before the England tour. If he does now become available we would look at it again to see if it could potentially work around our current overseas arrangements,\u201d Stewart told The Telegraph . \nIndia are scheduled to play three T20Is, three ODIs and five Tests against England starting with the first T20I at Old Trafford in Manchester on July 3.

The epic thriller ended with Dinesh Karthik smashing a six in the final ball to win the trophy and the match for India. But it was not the first time the side had won a T20I against their neighbours on the final ball. In a similar match played a couple of years ago, it was allrounder Hardik Pandya who established himself as the hero after taking his side to victory. \nPlaying the do-or-die group stage match of the World T20 in 2016 at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, India went on to set a modest target of 148 for Bangladesh. Needing 11 of the final over, Pandya was tasked with defending the total. With Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim in the middle, it looked like an easy target to chase down. \nPandya pitched a wider delivery to Mahmudullah first-off which went for a single. Needing 10 off 5, Rahim launched the second delivery for a boundary reducing the equation to 6 off 4. He scooped the next ball for another boundary and the equation turned to 2 runs to win in 3 balls. Rahim tried to launch the next ball for a six but it went straight to Shikhar Dhawan . \nNeeding 2 off 2, Mahmudullah could not keep his calm and he too tried to play a big shot. But a diving catch from Ravindra Jadeja sent him back to the pavilion. With two wickets in two balls, Bangladesh\u2019s task had gone from a casual walk to a nervous nailbiter. With 2 runs to win on last delivery, India brought all their fielders inside the circle. Pandya pitched it short and wide and the Shuvagata Hom failed to connect. As Bangladesh tried to steal a single to take the match to a Super Over, MS Dhoni ran full speed to the stumps and took off the bails. As the replays showed the player was out of the crease, India went on to win the match by a run. \nWATCH VIDEO: #OnThisDay in 2016, India pulled off a dramatic one-run win over Bangladesh in a #WT20 group match in Bangalore.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hardik pandya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pandya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mushfiqur rahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinesh karthik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmudullah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinnaswamy stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:03:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfa700d8906ed242b1e38663f4e1a200fb42997e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTBC.nj9JzlDvcymwOUFCLODWiGxiXq3u9ATwpsnLPgC1O7ccTP4JqXqevwGJWktMv3Q4tQdiiyZX2GvUU7aLWAieI0T9lk8i0", "site_full": "www.thehindu.com", "site": "thehindu.com", "site_section": "http://www.thehindu.com/?service=rss#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Hindu - Home", "title": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "title_full": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "published": "2018-03-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/article23337289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGRUMAN", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 806, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 427, "comments": 0, "shares": 427}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfa700d8906ed242b1e38663f4e1a200fb42997e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTBC.nj9JzlDvcymwOUFCLODWiGxiXq3u9ATwpsnLPgC1O7ccTP4JqXqevwGJWktMv3Q4tQdiiyZX2GvUU7aLWAieI0T9lk8i0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff Reporter", "published": "2018-03-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "text": "March 24, 2018 00:12   17:07 IST more-in Ruman Shariff wrote the paper with the help of a scribe \nRuman Shariff, 16, had to appear for his first language SSLC paper at a centre in Bengaluru while lying down on a mattress. \nThis is the only way as Ruman, a class 10 student of MES Kishore Kendra, met with an accident last month, after he completed his preparatory examination, and suffered a hip injury. \nThe school arranged for a scribe as he is unable to sit up for more than a few minutes. \n'Exam was easy' \n\u201cFriday\u2019s exam was easy.

The day I land in Bengaluru to spend a day with the players training at Sports Authority of India\u2019s (SAI) Centre of Excellence, there is only one stipulation from him: don\u2019t be late. \nWith the team of 30 that Singh is training to compete in the upcoming Commonwealth Games (CWG) in Gold Coast, Australia, punctuality, however, is never an issue. This has been his easiest outing yet, the coach admits. \u201cTheir focus is amazing. If the training is to start at 8 a.m., they are on the ground five minutes before time. If it ends at 10, they hang around for another 10 minutes, discussing the session,\u201d he says proudly. No looking back: Skills apart, the team has worked on building confidence and motivation. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nIt\u2019s all part of the dream the 30 women have together: to get into the top six in the world, to be counted as serious competitors, and win the big medals, starting with the CWG and going on to the World Cup and the Asian Games. More importantly, it\u2019s a fight for recognition, a desire to find their place in the sun, so long the preserve of the Indian men\u2019s hockey team. \nIt\u2019s attitude that sets the women apart from the men\u2019s side. Even though the intensity is as high, the men\u2019s training is often fun-filled. Not here, where even a minor game between two groups of trainees has the women going all out to outwit the opponent. \u201cWe all feel it is important to stay focussed. If it is a 60- or 90-minute training session, I don\u2019t see why anybody should have a problem concentrating completely on the game for that period of time. We are free the rest of the day anyway, right? Not that we don\u2019t have fun, especially when it is light training,\u201d says goalkeeper Savita Punia, one of the seniormost and key players in the side. \nThe team\u2019s scientific advisor, Wayne Lombard from South Africa, is proud of the work the women have put in over the past few months. \u201cYou talk about fitness, I have the data for Great Britain, China, South Africa, Ireland and Australia. And these girls are on par with them. In every sense. There has been a complete cultural change in training. Normally, I would prefer to test the girls every quarter but here it is done more often. And every time I test them, there is an average 0.2% improvement in their fitness levels, which is too good even at the highest level. They are amazing girls,\u201d Lombard says, one eye on his laptop, tracking the GPS coordinates of the players on field. A Chak De! moment \nThis women\u2019s team first made news in 2016 when they played at the Rio Olympics, qualifying for the quadrennial event for the first time ever \u2014 the only previous appearance in 1980 was invitational. There was little hope but even so, no one expected a last-place finish. Not even the women themselves. \n\u201cWe still believe we were better than what the results showed in Rio, but it wasn\u2019t our best performance. We learnt a lot from that experience,\u201d says 23-year-old Rani Rampal, captain, and one of the seniormost in the team, having made her India debut at 15. Also Read \nIndia\u2019s hockey pride: 2017 may well be the turning point for our women\u2019s team \nThe learnings, however, came later. In the immediate aftermath, it was shock and doubt that surrounded the women. Did they even deserve to be on the world stage? Were they the laughing stock of the hockey world? How could they face the questions back home, from family, friends and complete strangers? \n\u201cShah Rukh Khan in the beginning of Chak De! India must have felt something like that,\u201d the women joke, but the pain is still alive in their voices. \n\u201cIt was bad and it took us some time to recover, yes. But after a while, we decided we had to look at the future, not worry about a past that cannot be changed. Mind se hata diya Rio ko ,\u201d says Deep Grace Ekka, defender and self-proclaimed team chatterbox. \nSays Rani, \u201cMaybe we would never have started on the road to recovery if we had not experienced that loss there. We collectively decided to think two years ahead, to the Asian Games and the CWG. And then, maybe 2020, when we would not be newbies any more.\u201d The women are busy training for the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Australia. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nThese are young women, most of them, and they have mostly stayed away from the media glare. And it shows in their attitude and temperament. Singh says one of the things he has insisted on is that players address each other by their names. And everybody has to ask questions during team meetings. \u201cIt is inherent in their upbringing, the respect for seniors and coaches. But hierarchy in a team cannot win you titles. Now they are slowly coming around,\u201d he says. Largely, though, he prefers to stay in the shadows, allowing the women to tell their own tales. \nAnd they have begun doing so. Forward Vandana Katariya says earlier it was confusing on the field when everyone shouted \u2018 Didi, didi \u2019 for ball possession; that\u2019s changed. \u201cThe coach insists we call each other, and him, by name. We haven\u2019t exactly reached that stage, but we do add a name before \u2018 didi \u2019 now,\u201d she laughs. \nSingh is relentlessly pushing the women to break out of their shells. A month before our meeting, when I contact him to schedule my visit, he is eager and says he looks forward to outsiders visiting. \u201cThe more unscheduled questions the girls are asked, the more they will be forced to think for themselves,\u201d he says. The women admit it has helped. \u201c Thodi daring aa gayi hai ab . Now we know even if we are wrong, they will explain it to us and correct us,\u201d says reserve goalie Rajani Etimarpu. \nSingh knows the importance of routine and repetition. He is also a big fan of the haka (M\u0101ori war cry or ceremonial greeting) and its effect in psyching the opposition on the field. The girls have a chant: \u2018We dream the same dream. We think the same thing. We are the dream team. We are the Indian team. We are a champion team.\u2019 They say it before and after every game, and at every break, every time. It\u2019s amazing how, for a bunch that is as comfortable with English as an emu in flight, these lines just roll off the tongue. And there is no embarrassment; the women shout out at the top of their voices. \u201cI want any team that plays us to know we are in it to win and we will do anything for it. No more shoving us around or walking all over this team any more,\u201d says Singh. \nThe confidence has trickled down to the youngest players. From Namita Toppo and Rajani to Deepika Thakur and Savita, each one believes she is no longer there to simply make up the numbers. \u201cWhen we went to the Asia Cup, everyone was determined to win gold and qualify for the World Cup,\u201d Rajani says. \u201cWe all know what it means to play for India.\u201d Turning point \nIt was during the Europe tour before the Asia Cup, where the women did reasonably well even against the Belgian junior men\u2019s side, that they first believed they could win. The real turning point, however, was the Asian Champions Trophy three months after Rio, where the Indian women won their maiden gold. \u201cThat\u2019s when the first spark was ignited; that even though Rio wasn\u2019t great, we were ending the year on a high and could begin the new year with a new confidence,\u201d says Rani. Skills apart, the team has worked on building confidence and motivation. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nIndividual brilliance versus team effort has always been a tricky issue in Indian hockey. While most former greats continue to insist that Indians should rely on individual excellence because that\u2019s what they are good at, a series of foreign coaches have tried to build a firm team structure. \n\u201cOn and off the ground, we are working on improving our understanding of each other. Earlier, there was some selfishness in scoring, but in the past 7-8 months, since Harendra sir took over, most of our goals have come from the second post. The structure has changed a lot. We have actually started playing as a team with everyone thinking of the team result and not the scoresheet,\u201d says Vandana. \n**** \nIt\u2019s half past noon, and training and lunch is over. The women troop in in twos and threes for their daily neurotracker session. It\u2019s an activity they love, the highlight of their day, and perhaps the one thing that has seen their focus and peripheral vision shoot through the roof. \nThe target is simple: eight balls in constant motion on the screen, with four of them picked randomly to change colours. 3D glasses make it more real. The women have to keep tracking the balls that change colour, and identify them every time they stop moving. Each correct attempt increases the speed of the balls, wrong ones slow them down over a set of 30 attempts. The difficulty levels are from basic to advanced. \n\u201cSome of these girls have improved by more than 150% in their focus and performance here. In fact, only P.R. Sreejesh (the men\u2019s goalkeeper) has been able to keep up with them in terms of advancement. These girls are simply amazing,\u201d says SAI psychologist Priyanka Prabhakar. \nDeep Grace loves the activity the most. She operates the software. \u201cWhen Grace is around, all of us just chill. She is the lord and master of this set-up,\u201d laughs Priyanka. \nSingh is also working on making the women up-to-date on all the latest rule changes in international hockey, and the loopholes they can exploit on field. \u201cIt is important to be smart \u2014 you need to decide whether to work your a** off like a donkey or be a smart worker like a horse. International sports is not just about skill and strength, it is equally about smartness,\u201d Singh says. Battle against self \nOn field, the women get grilled for even the slightest signs of indiscipline. \u201cDiscipline is a habit, just like winning and losing are. Small things add up to big achievements. We know it all, but the past few months, we have been working on getting it into our subconscious. The pace at which hockey is played today, the absence of even one player for just two minutes can be critical. Sometimes, we concede soft goals because of it,\u201d Rani says. \nAll this progress, topped with the Asia Cup, where India got the better of three stronger, higher-ranked teams, has finally brought the team in the spotlight. For the first time in recent history, the women\u2019s team received more coverage and appreciation than the men. \nIt has made them more confident but there is no pressure of performance, they say. \u201cEarlier, hardly anybody came to watch women\u2019s games and not many knew of our matches, but now Indian supporters come to watch us; they came in Singapore, Korea and Japan too. It feels good to have that support. But there is no pressure. It only motivates us to do better,\u201d Vandana says. \u201cWe are now determined to do even better in the Commonwealth Games and prove ourselves. This year is very important for us and for women\u2019s hockey to claim its rightful place,\u201d says Rajani. \nIn absolute terms, the journey from a last-place finish at Rio to winning the Asia Cup was not very long. For the women who were part of both campaigns, however, it was a battle they had to fight, and win, against themselves. \nAs Rani says, \u201cLosing all the time had eroded our self-belief and motivation. We had to start from zero and understand that we have to win to convince both ourselves and others that we are good.\u201d \nThey were given few shots to do so, but that absence of spotlight seems a blessing in hindsight. They did not have a coach for more than a month, then three coaches were changed within a year and a half, one halfway through a European tour. But all that churn has seen them emerge even more self-reliant. They now carry that confidence into Gold Coast next month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harendra singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cwg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gold coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T16:18:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f98f9ddcb281b7013397b5d31cd29182a547ff5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDldwgwuQjH.D48w5ap.rYBWk7WPCKh4NMs5zkhoQ2ViAGrYxugBehPe6ggW0Ko6snnAA3tEm477podZlhkpZHqulPBnKubDvsc3ajRdKumH2qL6hKID2VI0cncw9W5I59lP7mHFWr9boG", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bangalore News, Latest Bangalore News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News", "title_full": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News - Times of India", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63424441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1774881,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f98f9ddcb281b7013397b5d31cd29182a547ff5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDldwgwuQjH.D48w5ap.rYBWk7WPCKh4NMs5zkhoQ2ViAGrYxugBehPe6ggW0Ko6snnAA3tEm477podZlhkpZHqulPBnKubDvsc3ajRdKumH2qL6hKID2VI0cncw9W5I59lP7mHFWr9boG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "B V Shivashankar", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News", "text": "BENGLAURU: The Karnataka assembly polls are set to go hi-tech with plans afoot to digitize the entire process, from managing electoral rolls to monitoring polling stations, through Internet Protocol (IP)-based webcasting and live-streaming of the counting of votes.\nAn Election Monitoring Dash Board (EMDB) will be set up at the offices of the chief election commissioner of India in New Delhi, the chief electoral officer (CEO) in Bengaluru and electoral officers at all district headquarters. EMDB will enable online monitoring both at polling and counting stations.\nWebcast was used on an experimental basis to monitor a few polling stations in the elections in various states between 2014 and 2018. It is the first time that the technology is being adopted to digitize the entire electoral process in a state. \u201cMost of the elements of our tech initiative are being used for the first time in India,\u201d said Sanjiv Kumar, CEO for Karnataka.\nAll 56,994 polling stations in the state will be GISmapped and linked with voters\u2019 Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC).\nAlerts will be sent to mobile phones of voters about their polling station and how to reach there, while a digital atlas of all 224 assembly constituencies will be created.\nSanjiv Kumar said 36 lakh mobile phones of Karnataka\u2019s 5.96 voters have been linked to the web portal so far. \u201cEfforts are on to link all mobiles to the portal before polling,\u201d he said.\nThe functioning of all EVMs and voter-verified audit trail (VVPAT) systems will be monitored. There will also be a software to keep a tab on candidates\u2019 expenditure. While social media accounts of the candidates will be closely monitored, it has been made mandatory for them to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts, and WhatsApp number.\n\u201cUnlike the pilots where laptops were used, digitization of the election process is going to be complete this time and servers will be hired for the purpose for the first time in India. The de-duplication analytic that eliminates redundancy in all stages will bring in high-level efficiency to the whole process,\u201d said Surya Sen A V, joint chief electoral officer in charge of technology adoption.\nWhile 10,000 polling stations considered to be sensitive will be facilitated with IP-based webcasting, the rest would be webcast through live videography. Voters can air their grievances online with ECI\u2019s App Sumadhan, while App Suvidha will be used to issue online permission to parties and candidates for public rallies, and use of vehicles for campaigning.\nTimes ViewAn election is always rife with speculation of cash and liquor for votes, trouble at booths, security issues and a host of other undemocratic happenings. In such an atmosphere, live streaming of the proceedings should come as a welcome change. In this digital era, it is good that the election authorities are adopting technology to make the process of both balloting and counting transparent, and hopefully, more free and fair. This should immediately reduce malpractices. It is hoped that this technology is adopted to ensure voters\u2019 names don\u2019t go missing, as is often the case.
