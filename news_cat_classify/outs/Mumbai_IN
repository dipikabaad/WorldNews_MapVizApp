The crime took place on March 4 at their Kharghar flat. The accused is a homemaker and her husband a civil contractor. Two of their children\u2014the victim and a 12-year-old son\u2014lived with them in Kharghar while the other two\u2014a 20-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son\u2014resided in their native hometown in Rajasthan. \n\nSenior inspector Dilip Kale said, \u201cThe accused allegedly strangulated her daughter with her dupatta inside their flat around 10.30am on March 4. At 1.45pm, her husband returned home for lunch. When he saw their daughter in the bedroom, his wife told him that she was fast asleep. Then, around 4pm, she called and informed him that their daughter was motionless. He rushed home to find her dead. By around 7pm, their relatives began to gather at their residence and called the police. Since there were strangulation marks on the girl\u2019s neck, we suspected foul play. Initially, we registered an accidental death case but sent her body for post-mortem to the Panvel rural hospital.\u201d \n\nKale further said, \u201cThe victim\u2019s parents took her body to their native place in Rajasthan where they conducted her last rites. Since the post-mortem report revealed the cause of death as choking, we registered a murder case and started a probe.\u201d \n\nCops recorded statements of the girl\u2019s schoolmates, one of whom said the victim had allegedly once told her that her mother had been assaulting her for the past six months as she suspected her of being in a sexual relationship with her father. Her mother had threatened to either kill her or her husband. \n\nThe schoolmates told cops that the girl had allegedly attempted suicide by consuming phenyl in February and had made up her mind to jump from her building\u2019s terrace, saying she was unable to bear the harassment by her mother. \n\nAfter the victim\u2019s parents returned from Rajasthan on Wednesday, they were summoned to the police station where the woman was grilled. She confessed to the crime and said her daughter always answered back and even hit her on being scolded. \u201cWhen the accused beat her up a day after the festival of Holi, the girl retaliated and her mother ended up strangulating her with a dupatta,\u201d said Kale and added that they are exploring the possibility of the father protecting the accused despite learning of the crime. \n\n\u201cWe will probe his role in the crime. As of now, we have registered an FIR under the Indian Penal Code\u2019s Section 302 (punishment for murder) against the accused woman. She was produced before the Panvel magistrate court on Thursday and has been remanded to police custody till March 27.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dilip kale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kharghar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T05:45:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcae70898b95e9e00a2930bda4f40fefd71af4d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBTP0lWRa0PqG9RoFGxFioHkjSWWPIUCo5t4l9Dreocn1hlTr12GIBUvX85IvM4XqUgYfFYUaIa0pzpwdKE.0a1SdwFDcZ_XTRzG8oYvjYman1uM8nguljbbVaFtmYJmYeu_7ZwpRitdqMQr7vJyNb26j2rdo29B_jFLM_c0mtYFw--", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News: India News, Breaking News, Latest Bollywood News, Sports News, Business News &amp; Political News | Times of India", "title": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News", "title_full": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News - Times of India", "published": "2018-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63416936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138621,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5314, "comments": 0, "shares": 5314}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcae70898b95e9e00a2930bda4f40fefd71af4d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBTP0lWRa0PqG9RoFGxFioHkjSWWPIUCo5t4l9Dreocn1hlTr12GIBUvX85IvM4XqUgYfFYUaIa0pzpwdKE.0a1SdwFDcZ_XTRzG8oYvjYman1uM8nguljbbVaFtmYJmYeu_7ZwpRitdqMQr7vJyNb26j2rdo29B_jFLM_c0mtYFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News", "text": "MUMBAI: Indian cricketer Mohammed Shami has got a major boost after he was cleared by the BCCI of match-fixing charges levelled against him by his wife Hasin Jahan, who had claimed that the cricketer had received unaccounted money from a Pakistani woman.\nALSO READ: Highlights of Mohammed Shami's controversy\nWith this development the path has been cleared for his participation with Delhi Daredevils in the IPL starting April 7. BCCI will now proceed with offering him a Grade 'B' annual retainership contract, which will make him richer by Rs 3 crore.\nALSO READ: We are not concerned over Shami's private matters, says Shukla\nShami has taken 110 wickets in the 30 Tests he played so far while accounted 91 scalps in 50 ODIs.

Shami has denied all the allegations.\n\"The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) had requested Mr Neeraj Kumar , former Police Commissioner of Delhi and Head of BCCI Anti-Corruption Unit , to investigate the allegations against Mohd.

The charges of adultery and domestic violence are being investigated by the Kolkata Police and that is out of the Board's purview.\n\"This is a very good news for Shami and for Indian cricket. The charges of corruption against him looked too far-fetched. He has been a committed player for India.

No sea turtles were hatching here as garbage is a huge hurdle for them to cross. But now, thanks to the Clean Versova Beach drive, we are all happy and blessed to have seen these newly hatched Olive ridley turtles.\u201d \n\n\nClean-up activists and animal welfare groups together ensured that the little turtles navigated their way into the sea safely, from the hatching site, which was 30-35m from the shoreline. \n\n\n\nAs news of the newly hatched turtles spread, morning walkers and locals thronged the beach to enjoy the experience. \n\n\n\nSocial networking sites, including Twitters, were also abuzz with photographs and videos of the newly hatched turtles. \u201cI have witnessed something surreal today. A life changing experience. 80 Olive Ridley turtles walking back into the sea,\u201d tweeted Shaunak Modi of Marine Life of Mumbai, a group promoting marine life welfare in the city. \n\n\n\nState chief conservator of forests (mangroves cell) N Vasudevan said the department was happy to see the photographs and videos of the turtles on Versova beach. He, however, said: \u201cSome locals, who later went to the beach, informed my department that they could not find any egg shells. I do not know if their doubts are real or not, but if we get any formal intimation on it, I will have to inquire into the matter.\u201d \n\nShah added that a Mumbai-based forest official also came to the beach in the afternoon to do a panchanama after being informed about turtle hatchings. \u201cFor the last few weeks, we had been noticing turtles coming up to the Versova beach and digging into the sand, near Sagar Kutir wadi end. We had also contacted a marine biologist to learn more about it and are today happy that so many turtles hatched,\u201d Shah told TOI. \n\nEnvironmentalist D Stalin said: \u201cThis is a very good development at the cleaned up Versova beach. However, care should be taken that the lights at the beach are made dimmer and the area cordoned off till the nesting period is fully over, as human poachers are a threat for these turtles. Also, bright lights may confuse the young hatchlings.\u201d \n\nThe return of turtles has brought cheer among marine biologists who lament that nearly 80-90% of beaches in Maharashtra have been damaged to such an extent that it becomes unfavourable for Olive ridley turtles to lay their eggs. \n\n\u201cWhile today is certainly a day of celebration since Olive ridley turtles nesting and hatchings have been seen after a very long time period, I cannot help but think of so many other beaches which have been damaged and destroyed due to encroachments and other illegal activities which make it impossible for these sea turtles to step on for their natural nesting,\u201d pointed out Dr Deepak Apte, marine biologist and head of Bombay Natural History Society. \n\nBarely 30- 35 isolated beaches on the Konkan coast are currently hosting their nesting. \u201cThe females lay their eggs above the high tide line, in a sandy shore. How many such sandy shores are really there? Often people illegally steal sand or put up hawking stalls on beaches.\u201d \n\nHe, however, added that it is commendable that consistent efforts by the citizens to clean Versova beach have led to this rare turtle nesting site there.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "afroz shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mumbai news - times of india mumbai", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versova beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versova", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:59:23.121+03:00"}], "totalResults": 978, "moreResultsAvailable": 968, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746407496&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3AMumbai&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 863, "extra": {"place": "Mumbai", "country": "IN", "lat": "19.0759837", "lng": "72.8776559"}}
