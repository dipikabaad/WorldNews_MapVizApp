CBC Radio \u00b7 March 22 Shakila Zareen at her home in the Vancouver area, B.C., on March 21, 2018. She was forced into marriage at 17 to a man she didn't know.(Tina Lovgreen/CBC) Listen 16:36 \nWhen Shakila Zareen heard footsteps outside her mother's house one night in 2012, she peered into the dark to try to see who was there. \nShe heard the voices of her husband, her brother-in-law and some other men. \nSuddenly, she saw a hunter's rifle pointed at her. \n\"There's no way that they could be this ruthless,\" she remembers thinking. \nThen everything went black. Shakila Zareen was ignored by the police when she reported domestic abuse, so she left her husband. But then he came to her mother's house one night.1:27 \nLAURA LYNCH : And so you went home to your mother's and then your husband showed up. If you don't mind, tell me what happened. SHAKILA ZAREEN : Right after the police station that night, I went to my mom's. \nI remember I was in the house. I was sitting on the ground and my mum was praying. My sister was in the kitchen. And I could hear footsteps at the door. I could hear my husband and my brother-in-law and some other men \u2014 I don't know who they were. My eyes were trying to adjust to see who was there, but I could see a hunter's rifle pointed at me and I remember thinking to myself: 'There's no way that they could be this ruthless.' \nBut I got very scared and said: 'Please God, don't let them hurt me.' And then that's all, that's all I remember. \nIt went black. \nI thought that I was dreaming. I just remember begging my mom to wake me because I was in so much pain and I wanted the dream to be over. LAURA LYNCH : Was it in fact your husband who shot you in your face? \nSHAKILA ZAREEN : Yes, yes, it was. \nLAURA LYNCH : You survived and then the Indian government flew you to New Delhi for a series of reconstructive surgeries. Tell me what that was like for you \u2014 to go to New Delhi and to be helped? \nSHAKILA ZAREEN : I actually found out over the radio that I was being taken to India, and it gave me hope for a new life and hope for a future. \nLAURA LYNCH : Shakila, do you mind describing for me what the injuries were that you suffered? \nSHAKILA ZAREEN : The bullet that hit my face basically took half of my face off, and it was gone \u2014 the entire half of my face. My nose, my eye, my mouth, my teeth, my jaw. Previous Next Zareen's brother-in-law had forced her into marriage to a man she didn't know when she was 17. \nHer new husband abused and raped her, she alleges, but when she reported it to the police in her home city of Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, they shrugged it off. \nThat same day, she says, her husband and brother-in-law shot her in the face. \nBoth men deny the attack.

Steven Page, now living in the U.S., has a solo career and is also touring as part of a trio with Craig Northey on guitar and Kevin Fox on cello. \n\nMeanwhile, the four remaining members of the Barenaked Ladies are on a much larger tour promoting their latest album, Fake Nudes .\n\n\"Steve's been really open and frankly really respectful of the fact that the band is still here,\" Robertson says. \n\nBut Page hasn't always felt respected by them. He acknowledges he was hurt that the band continued to use the same name after his departure. \n\n\"I felt negated by that in a certain way, like it eliminated my contribution. I don't feel that way now, but that's how I felt about it then.\" \n\nThe original frontman also sued Robertson three years ago, seeking a share of the royalties from the group's theme song for The Big Bang Theory TV show.\n\nBarenaked Ladies weigh in on fan fascination with their split 0:41\n\nA special duet Another point of difference involves arguably their biggest hit ever, If I Had a Million Dollars .  \n\n\"It's one of the first songs that Ed and I ever wrote together when we were 18,\" says Page. \n\nAfter the split, the BNL continued to perform it. \"We've played that song every night of our careers for 30 years. And every concert features that song,\" says Stewart. \n\nPage, though, never sings it. \n\n\"I think for me it's special, it's a duet between me and Ed,\" he says. \"And I always thought it would feel weird, and sound weird to the audience too, if I was either on my own or with somebody else. So I think, for me, it's really about that interaction between the two of us.\" \n\nFrom left, Ed Robertson, Tyler Stewart, Steven Page and Jim Creeggan in December 1990. (Mike Slaugher/Toronto Star via Getty Images)\nPower of time There may well be a moment of interaction like that at the Juno Awards. \nThe temporarily reunited band will perform two of their original songs together and speak as the original ensemble when accepting their induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. \n\n\"I'm not looking at it like this is a time to, like, rehash everything, I'm just going for the celebration,\" Robertson says. \"We worked with Steve for 20 years. It's going to be really fun to get up on stage and do four-and-a-half minutes of older songs.\" \n\nBarenaked Ladies share a wild road story that involves a small car & a moose \n\nThough there has been animosity in the decade since they were last together, Page alludes to the healing power of time and his comfort level with seeing the group again.  \n\n\"If you'd asked me a year ago even, I wouldn't have known how to answer,\" he says, referring to what it will be like seeing his old band mates again. \"I think we've both forged our own paths now that we're very secure in. So it's a little easier to remember the past without getting mired in it too.\" \n\nThe four remaining members of the Barenaked Ladies, seen here at Toronto's Massey Hall, are in the middle of a tour promoting their latest album, Fake Nudes. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nIrreconcilable differences? The music may well be the easiest part for a band that spent its early years packed in a van, driving across Canada, riffing on stage and making every show a bit different. \n\n\"We did it for 20-plus years, and also there is a certain chemistry that was always there,\" Stewart says. \n\nSo is there any chance of this one-off performance becoming permanent? \n\n\"Never say never,\" says Robertson. \n\n\"I have learned to not predict, and I think it all depends on how it goes,\" Page says when asked the same question in his separate interview. \n\n\"I don't think they have any desire to have me back in the band. I know I don't have a desire to be back in the band. But if there are opportunities to collaborate like this and we enjoy it, like, there's no rule saying we can't.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven page", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tyler stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david common", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan mitsui/cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robertson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bnl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "music hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "junos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danforth music hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T11:13:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ce02c37f41968169469869b564dd4f5604a3d83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzXjEUlRPZdRK4t33gdcCDC0KCoWMMk0k9NvYYqhTmsAgPR4i2XmQYUD4arTQaLveZibkcgNDjL1Ka2NpopEKIqUZ0DLis7HVFo2m7MWg_YZqrSPg7AP4bBDgz5VZC4Eybl29YR4rNz62f69eVOr1aaWA--", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-britishcolumbia.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "B.C. announces $7.5M for music fund for emerging artists, live music events", "title_full": "B.C. announces $7.5M for music fund for emerging artists, live music events", "published": "2018-03-23T03:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4588583.1521747664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/guitar.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1016, "comments": 0, "shares": 1016}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ce02c37f41968169469869b564dd4f5604a3d83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzXjEUlRPZdRK4t33gdcCDC0KCoWMMk0k9NvYYqhTmsAgPR4i2XmQYUD4arTQaLveZibkcgNDjL1Ka2NpopEKIqUZ0DLis7HVFo2m7MWg_YZqrSPg7AP4bBDgz5VZC4Eybl29YR4rNz62f69eVOr1aaWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc", "published": "2018-03-23T03:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "B.C. announces $7.5M for music fund for emerging artists, live music events", "text": "B.C. has launched a new, $7.5-million music fund to find emerging artists, foster up-and-coming talent and support live music events in the province.\nAmplify B.C. will focus on four different funding areas: career development, industry initiative, live music and company development.

He acknowledges he was hurt that the band continued to use the same name after his departure. \n\"I felt negated by that in a certain way, like it eliminated my contribution. I don't feel that way now, but that's how I felt about it then.\" \nThe original frontman also sued Robertson three years ago, seeking a share of the royalties from the group's theme song for The Big Bang Theory TV show. Barenaked Ladies band members Ed Robertson, Tyler Stewart and Kevin Hearn talk about why, a decade later, the band's fans are still fascinated by the reasons behind the BNL breakup with Steven Page0:41 A special duet \nAnother point of difference involves arguably their biggest hit ever, If I Had a Million Dollars . \n\"It's one of the first songs that Ed and I ever wrote together when we were 18,\" says Page. \nAfter the split, the BNL continued to perform it. \"We've played that song every night of our careers for 30 years. And every concert features that song,\" says Stewart. \nPage, though, never sings it. \n\"I think for me it's special, it's a duet between me and Ed,\" he says. \"And I always thought it would feel weird, and sound weird to the audience too, if I was either on my own or with somebody else. So I think, for me, it's really about that interaction between the two of us.\" From left, Ed Robertson, Tyler Stewart, Steven Page and Jim Creeggan in December 1990.(Mike Slaugher/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Power of time \nThere may well be a moment of interaction like that at the Juno Awards. \nThe temporarily reunited band will perform two of their original songs together and speak as the original ensemble when accepting their induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. \n\"I'm not looking at it like this is a time to, like, rehash everything, I'm just going for the celebration,\" Robertson says. \"We worked with Steve for 20 years. It's going to be really fun to get up on stage and do four-and-a-half minutes of older songs.\" Barenaked Ladies share a wild road story that involves a small car & a moose \nThough there has been animosity in the decade since they were last together, Page alludes to the healing power of time and his comfort level with seeing the group again. \n\"If you'd asked me a year ago even, I wouldn't have known how to answer,\" he says, referring to what it will be like seeing his old band mates again. \"I think we've both forged our own paths now that we're very secure in. So it's a little easier to remember the past without getting mired in it too.\" The four remaining members of the Barenaked Ladies, seen here at Toronto's Massey Hall, are in the middle of a tour promoting their latest album, Fake Nudes.(Evan Mitsui/CBC) Irreconcilable differences? \nThe music may well be the easiest part for a band that spent its early years packed in a van, driving across Canada, riffing on stage and making every show a bit different. \n\"We did it for 20-plus years, and also there is a certain chemistry that was always there,\" Stewart says. \nSo is there any chance of this one-off performance becoming permanent? \n\"Never say never,\" says Robertson. \n\"I have learned to not predict, and I think it all depends on how it goes,\" Page says when asked the same question in his separate interview. \n\"I don't think they have any desire to have me back in the band. I know I don't have a desire to be back in the band. But if there are opportunities to collaborate like this and we enjoy it, like, there's no rule saying we can't.\" More from CBC \nWatch David Common's feature on the Barenaked Ladies and Steven Page reunion from CBC's The National: The Barenaked Ladies are set to reunite, but only for one night. They're celebrating their induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, so former frontman Steven Page will rejoin his bandmates for a two-song performance at this year's Junos \u2014 after barely speaking to each other for nearly a decade. Ahead of their much-anticipated performance, CBC News spoke to the Ladies and Page \u2014 separately \u2014 about life after the breakup and whether there's any real hope of getting the band back together, permanently5:34 Corrections Craig Northey's name was spelled incorrectly when this story was first published.

Around 300 noisy fans have crammed into this tiny arena, where students are selling bottles of beer on a makeshift table and players from the Oxford women's team are drumming up ticket sales for their game against Cambridge the next day. Oxford goes ahead halfway through the second period and hangs on for a 2-1 victory. As the fans file out to the sounds of Bachman-Turner Overdrive's Taking Care of Business , Johnson pumps his fist and doctoral student Jordan Thompson offers a wide smile. \"It's always good to see Cambridge going down,\" he says as his fianc\u00e9, Vania Pinto, also an Oxford PhD student, nods approvingly.\nThis is no ordinary hockey rivalry. The Oxford Dark Blues and Cambridge Light Blues have been battling each other on the ice for more than 130 years, long before the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs or the Montreal Canadiens. (Although even this pales in comparison to the Oxford-Cambridge rowing rivalry, which dates to 1829.) And the bitterness hasn't subsided.\n\"Both teams prepare for this like war,\" says Daniel Orvomaa, Cambridge's backup goaltender, who grew up playing hockey in Finland and never encountered such fierce competitiveness until he joined the Light Blues. \"It's hard to overstate how seriously people take the rivalry,\" adds Oxford forward Joey Wenig, a law student from Calgary.\nOxford forward Joey Wening checks his stick after leaving the ice between periods on March 3, 2018.\nJim Ross\nOn Saturday, the teams will meet once more but this time in Switzerland to commemorate the 100th varsity match, an annual winner-take-all showdown that dates to the late 1800s and has only been interrupted for world wars. The venue for the historic game will be an outdoor rink in the Swiss resort town of St. Moritz, the site of the first varsity match in 1885 when the universities reportedly threw together a bunch of players on the only ice surface they could find in Europe. The actual date and details of the game are fuzzy, but it's been verified by the International Ice Hockey Federation, so both teams lay claim to the oldest hockey rivalry in the world.\nAnd who's to argue with hockey programs that have produced luminaries such as former Prime Minister Lester Pearson, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, one-time NHL boss Clarence Campbell, Nobel Prize winner Michael Spence and former Governor General Roland Michener?\nHundreds of alumni will be flying in from around the world for the weekend event, which will feature two alumni games as well as the men's varsity match (the women's teams were invited but couldn't make it because of scheduling issues). For many alumni, such as 74-year-old Peter Anderson, it's a chance to relive their college playing days and, with hope, inflict one more loss on their arch enemy.\n\"It's a big deal,\" said Anderson, a former biochemistry professor at the University of Ottawa who played for Cambridge in 1968 and 1969. He never won a varsity match during his playing days and the memory of those losses still burns. \"You just remember it forever,\" he said.\nOxford and Cambridge men\u2019s hockey players exit their dressing rooms before their game on March 3, 2018.\nJim Ross\nAnderson will get a chance for an early dig at his old rivals when he drops the puck in a special ceremony before the game with another old timer, H. Ian Macdonald, an 88-year-old economist from Toronto who played at Oxford from 1952 to 1955 and went on to become chair of Hockey Canada as well as a long-time president of York University. Anderson won't say for sure, but he won't deny that a slight elbow at the ceremony isn't out of the question.\nThe anniversary is also a fitting recognition of the role Oxford and Cambridge have played in developing university hockey in Britain. Both universities now have four full teams, men's and women's varsity clubs as well as development teams for players learning the game. A group of Oxford players also helped found the British Universities Ice Hockey Association in 2003, a national league that has grown to 48 men's and women's teams at universities across England, Scotland and Wales. The Oxford Ice Rink runs an ever-increasing number of hockey-skills programs and this fall Cambridge will open a new hockey arena, a first for the university and the city of Cambridge.\n\"When I first came here, there were only two university teams, Oxford and Cambridge,\" says Bill Harris, a Cambridge anatomy professor and hockey diehard from Toronto who came to the university in 1997. \"So over the course of the 20 years that I've been here, it's grown from basically two teams to about 50 teams, which is amazing.\"\nHarris has been a guiding light for university hockey at Cambridge and Britain, serving as a volunteer coach, a player on the development team and the driving force for the new arena. It was Harris who realized when he went to Cambridge that the university was sitting on a \u00a31-million ($1.8-million) gift from a Swiss-Canadian businessman, David Gattiker, who had donated the money in 1993 for the specific purpose of building a hockey arena.\nCambridge University professor Bill Harris, who is also a hockey player for the varsity Cambridge Eskimos, is seen before his game against Oxford, March 3, 2018.\nJim Ross\nHarris knew all too well that the Light Blues badly needed a local rink given that the closest venue was an hour away in Peterborough, which has limited the men's and women's teams to just one hour of ice time a week. So he got to work on the arena, prying funding out of the local councils, cajoling reluctant university officials and badgering the British Army to pull up the roughly 200 homemade landmines that had been planted on the proposed site during the Second World War.\nThe final push to cover most of the \u00a35.2-million construction costs came thanks to \u00a3300,000 in donations from Canadian alumni. The 500-seat facility will open in September. Now 67, Harris is retiring this spring but he can't wait to see Cambridge finally have its own rink. \"I think we're going to end up here with some really very strong development of hockey,\" he said.\nCanadians and Americans have played significant roles in British hockey for years and players from both countries have traditionally dominated most university teams. The Canadian influence is so strong that before the Oxford-Cambridge league game this month O Canada was played along with God Save the Queen.\nCambridge's Ivan Grega (L) is checked by Oxford's Jason Lacombe, March 3, 2018. Jim Ross But that dominance is fading as the face of hockey here changes. Today, Oxford and Cambridge have players from a dozen countries across Europe as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, India, South Korea and, recently, South Africa. There's also a growing number of players from Britain, where hockey has gained a foothold in several pockets around the country.\nMany Brits, such as Cambridge goaltender Stephanie Owen, fell in love with the sport almost by accident. She grew up near Liverpool and had never heard of hockey until she landed at Oxford for her undergraduate degree. Someone showed her an NHL game online and she was hooked. \"I was like, this is such a fast-paced, awesome sport, just the environment of it and atmosphere of it,\" said Owen, 24, who has since adopted the Winnipeg Jets as her favourite team. She's now balancing hockey practices and games with her research into the genomics of ovarian cancer as a PhD student at Cambridge. \"You bring the intensity to the game that you bring to your academic work,\" she said.\nAnd there is no give on the academic side for players at Oxford or Cambridge. Sports are truly amateur pursuits here. There are no athletic scholarships, no recruitment of players, no high-paid coaches and no glittering facilities. Players wear mismatched uniforms, endure long bus rides in the middle of the night and exchange cases of beer at centre ice after each game. Make no mistake, though, these are not your typical rink rats or blockhead hockey players.\nOne look through the lineups and you'll find a host of PhD candidates in everything from global health science to microbiology, history and medical anthropology. Oxford forward Tim Donnison, 26, is researching new vaccines as part of his doctorate in medicine while Cambridge co-captain Spencer Brennan has degree in chemical engineering from McGill University and is now working on a doctorate in physics.\n\"It's unlike any other hockey team that's for sure,\" says Brennan, 28, who's from Toronto and finds some of the discussions during bus rides mind-bending. \"PhDs here work like crazy because that's how you get here, that's how you do good work.\" All but two players on the Cambridge squad are post graduates. \"We always say we're the most educated team in the world,\" says Cambridge co-captain Vaclav Beranek, 28, who's from the Czech Republic and is pursuing a doctorate in molecular biology. \"Or most overeducated.\"\nOxford\u2019s Jordan Ho (10) is checked by Cambridge\u2019s Vaclav Bernaek (9) during a hockey game on March 3, 2018.\nJim Ross\nBut for now all focus is on Saturday's varsity match in St. Moritz and the intensity is building. Oxford's players feel they have the edge. The Dark Blues have won both league games and they've got a hot goalie in Fabian Sivnert, a master's student in comparative government who played in the top junior ranks in Sweden and at NCAA Division 1 Bemidji State. \"This year, we are quietly confident,\" says Donnison, who has yet to win a varsity game in his four years at Oxford. \"It's all about the varsity game.\"\nBut Cambridge isn't conceding anything. Eligibility rules mean Oxford will be without some key players for the varsity game and Cambridge has focused its entire season on this one match, even forfeiting some league play in order to better prepare for the varsity. The Light Blues will also have some players back from injury, giving them a full roster for the first time in months.\n\"Every single thing comes down to playing this one game,\" Brennan says. \"We really do hate them. It's not pleasant out there on the ice.\"\n@PwaldieGLOBE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.twitter.com/PwaldieGLOBE"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim johnson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vania pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oxford university", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cambridge university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T07:38:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4706fbdcb271851ed2afe8d65ae55e1f1cf44f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzXjEUlRPZdRK4t33gdcCDC0DM4PLhqP.5Y7crkxZoHr7xlUimIv5GZoKWyRwvsbhR6.v9PcLqP6UDKCU5mYzXIMyRdGEXuCUi_Dux2TGU9hPJyYxqsf7Ti3HPilYK6zVAzlWPl2LuK8rI-", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-britishcolumbia.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Granville Island parking crisis hits tour bus operators in the wallet", "title_full": "Granville Island parking crisis hits tour bus operators in the wallet", "published": "2018-03-23T23:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4590980.1521841240!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/tour-bus-on-granville-island.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 521, "comments": 0, "shares": 521}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4706fbdcb271851ed2afe8d65ae55e1f1cf44f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzXjEUlRPZdRK4t33gdcCDC0DM4PLhqP.5Y7crkxZoHr7xlUimIv5GZoKWyRwvsbhR6.v9PcLqP6UDKCU5mYzXIMyRdGEXuCUi_Dux2TGU9hPJyYxqsf7Ti3HPilYK6zVAzlWPl2LuK8rI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc", "published": "2018-03-23T23:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Granville Island parking crisis hits tour bus operators in the wallet", "text": "Like death and taxes, a Granville Island parking controversy is one of life's certainties in Vancouver.\nThe latest concerns tour bus operators who say they've been blindsided by news that starting May 15 Granville Island is eliminating all tour bus parking spots and introducing annual fees for buses that drive onto the island.\nLandSea Tours president Kevin Pearce says it's unfair that Granville Island has introduced the new policies without consulting the tour industry.\nOne of Vancouver's most popular tourist destinations, Granville Island is located on federal land and operated by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. (CBC)\n\"It hasn't been thought out very well,\" he said. \"Yesterday we had a [company] meeting and we said maybe we don't go to Granville Island anymore.\"\nCantrail Coach Lines general manager Dean Clark says the new fees are an unexpected hit to everyone's bottom line.\n\"The big issue is that you set your rates a year in advance,\" said Clark. \"Bus companies will end up eating this cost.\"\nGranville Island currently has six free tour bus parking spots and charges nothing for island access. But spokesman Scott Fraser says the lack of regulation has led to mayhem and gridlock.\nNew report proposes elevator to Granville Island \"I personally one day witnessed 14 or 15 buses trying to manoeuvre into those six spots,\" he said.\n\"During our high season, which now starts in May and goes through October, we have too many buses trying to be here all at the same time.

(Chad Pawson/CBC)\n\"Online permits\" are assigned to a single vehicle licence plate. The more expensive \"physical permit\" can be shared between fleet vehicles.\nTour buses with permits can access new passenger dropoff and pickup areas near the east end of the island, but will have to find parking elsewhere.\n\"It's this fee just to get in, just to drop people off \u2014 that's the shocking one.
