However, the term is usually used for the terrorists who were killed in the operations. \nSpeaking at an event in Istanbul's Ba\u011fc\u0131lar district, Erdo\u011fan said that he discussed the ongoing counter-terror operation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. \nThe president underlined that Turkey will continue to protect the victims of the Syrian war, adding that it would not take a step back in its anti-terror operations. \n\"The work won't stop in Afrin, there is also Idlib, Manbij,\" Erdo\u011fan said, signaling the continuation of Operation Olive Branch. \nOperation Olive Branch was launched by Turkey on Jan. 20 to remove the PKK/PYD/YPG/KCK and Daesh terrorists from Afrin in northwestern Syria. The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) entered Afrin town center and liberated it from terrorists on March 18. \nAccording to the Turkish General Staff, the operation aims to establish security and stability along Turkish borders and in the region as well as to protect Syrian people from the oppression and cruelty of terrorists. \nThe operation is being carried out under the framework of Turkey's rights within international law, U.N. Security Council resolutions, its right to self-defense under the U.N. charter and respect for Syria's territorial integrity, it said. \nThe military also said, \"utmost importance\" is being placed on not harming any civilians. \nThe operation in Afrin \u2013 bordering Turkey's Hatay and Kilis provinces \u2013 was widely expected in the wake of Turkey's Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria, which cleared Daesh terrorists from Turkey's border between Aug. 24, 2016, and March 2017. \nOn March 18, Turkish-backed troops liberated the town center of Afrin, which had been a major hideout for the YPG/PKK since 2012 when the Assad regime in Syria left the city to the terror group without putting up a fight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Erdo\u011fan ISTANBUL President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said he told both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that \u201cTurkey will not step back in Syria,\u201d vowing that the ongoing campaign in Afrin will be expanded to other parts of the war-torn country, including Manbij.\n\u201cLast night I spoke with U.S. President Trump on these issues. I discussed the same things with Putin two days ago. I told them: \u2018We won\u2019t take steps backward from here. We are on the side of the suffering and the oppressed,\u2019\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in an address at a meeting of his Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Istanbul on March 23.\nErdo\u011fan and Trump spoke on the phone late on March 22 about strained ties between Ankara and Washington, particularly troubled due to the U.S.\u2019s ongoing partnership with the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG to be the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) and therefore as a terrorist organization.\nThe Turkish military, along with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), launched \u201cOperation Olive Branch\u201d against the YPG in Afrin on Jan. 20, and Erdo\u011fan vowed that operations \u201cwill not end in Afrin. Next are Idlib and Manbij.\u201d\nManbij, a northwestern Syrian town, is particularly important as it is still under the control of the YPG alongside U.S. troops. Turkey has long been urging the U.S. to let the YPG pull back from Manbij to the east of Euphrates amid threats that it will not hesitate to launch an attack on YPG positions even if American troops are present.\nNo withdrawal from Manbij: US\nHowever, a senior U.S. official said the U.S. \u201chas no intention to leave Manbij,\u201d despite Turkey\u2019s words.\n\u201cU.S. forces are located in Manbij. We have made it very clear with the Turkish government that we will continue to operate there,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a press conference in response to a question about the U.S.\u2019s stance on Manbij.\nNauert also said talks with Ankara \u201chave not been concluded\u201d and Washington is willing to continue conversations, referring to the three \u201ctechnical committees\u201d formed by Turkey and the U.S. to solve contentious issues between the two countries.\nTurkish and American delegations met in Washington on March 8 and 9 to find a way to resolve the Manbij problem but the dismissal of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has caused uncertainty about how the two countries will proceed. Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n is expected to travel to the U.S. to meet his counterpart John Sullivan next week.\n\u2018More than 3,700 terrorists neutralized\u2019\nMeanwhile, Erdo\u011fan stated that Turkey\u2019s operations against the PKK and YPG are ongoing in various parts of Syria and Iraq and the number of \u201cneutralized terrorists\u201d in Syria since Jan. 20 exceeds 3,700.\n\u201cWe will continue.

Speaking at an event in Istanbul's Ba\u011fc\u0131lar district, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Friday that he discussed the ongoing counterterrorism operation against the YPG with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. \nHe said that Turkey will not step back in its counterterrorism operations and will continue to protect the victims of the Syrian war. \"The work won't stop in Afrin, there is also Idlib, Manbij,\" Erdo\u011fan said, signaling the continuation of Operation Olive Branch against the YPG, while also reiterating Turkey's determined stance to eliminate PKK threats to its national security. The northern Syrian city of Manbij has been one of the most hotly debated points of contention between Ankara and Washington. In Idlib, however, the Turkish military established observation points last October to monitor the cease-fire in the de-escalation zones. \nAccording to the Astana agreement, reached between Turkey, Russia and Iran last year, Turkey is projected to gradually establish 12 observation points, from Idlib's north to south. \nAnkara's demand from the U.S. to cease arming the YPG and ensure its withdrawal to east of the Euphrates dates back to former President Barack Obama's time in office. The U.S. had promised to meet Ankara's demands, but has not so far, which has strained relations between the two countries. \nAs part of recent rapprochement between the two NATO allies, Ankara looks to establish an agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of the YPG from Manbij and the future administration of the city. \nForeign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said earlier this month that there has been a mutual understanding on the need for a road map, but no deal has been finalized yet with the U.S.. \nAccording to Turkish officials, Turkish and U.S. troops would ensure security in Manbij once the YPG withdraws and the two countries would monitor the withdrawal process. \nAnkara has been arguing that the future administration of Manbij should reflect the demographics of the province, determined according to a census before the civil war broke out and the YPG took control, which was predominantly Arab. \n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said the same model will be applied to other regions afterwards, including in those east of the Euphrates River and Raqqa. \nA U.S. State Department spokesperson on Thursday said that the U.S. has no intention to leave Manbij.\"U.S. forces are located in Manbij. We have made it very clear with the Turkish government that we continue to operate there,\" Heather Nauert said in a press conference in response to a question about the U.S. position on Manbij. \nMeanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said on Friday that Turkey reached an understanding with the U.S. during the meetings on March 8-9 and an undersecretary might visit Washington to try \nto find common ground on Manbij. Speaking at a press conference in Ankara, Aksoy reiterated that Turkey expects solid steps from the U.S. and that Foreign Ministry Undersecretary \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n might visit Washington next week for talks on Manbij. \nTurkey believes that U.S. President Trump also wants to improve bilateral ties, but that his efforts are undermined by holdovers from the previous administration and establishment officials. \n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Ankara is aware of Trump's eagerness to normalize relations, but added that \"he should be handling the system fully\" to do so. \nErdo\u011fan and Trump discussed bilateral and regional issues over the phone, Presidential Spokesman \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n said Thursday. \nThe conversation marks the third time the two presidents have spoken since November 2017, and it was two months since their last call. \n\"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to reaffirm the importance of strong relations between the United States and Turkey, as NATO allies and strategic partners, and to exchange views on regional developments,\" a statement from the White House said. \nTouching on the possible implications of the ouster of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on ties, Aksoy said that continuity and maintaining dialogue is fundamental. \nTrump said Thursday that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton will replace McMaster as national security adviser next month. \nAfter former State of Secretary Rex Tillerson's visit in February, Ankara and Washington agreed to establish joint working groups to overcome their differences, particularly the U.S.' support for the YPG in Syria, the G\u00fclenist Terror Group (FET\u00d6) and Iraq. \nThe decision on Manbij was discussed on March 8-9 between the working groups from both countries in Washington.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdo\u011fan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pkk-affiliated people's protection units", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manbij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euphrates river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ba\u011fc\u0131lar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:57:20.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f28319992d5ad7fe9c95e27b0cd69246a0194b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tz5sLjv.6M30X0iKG7yjilNM_hdkIW31ee9S6rwALQTIOp0n8mz5v4OOCyWoH.UGa6ZPjQ2xbF011ACXg5dpJVSjmpNoH3jFeq1rxN4EBpng--", "site_full": "aa.com.tr", "site": "aa.com.tr", "site_section": "http://www.aa.com.tr/rss/ajansgunceleng.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131 G\u00fcncel Haberler", "title": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "title_full": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "published": "2018-03-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2018/03/24/thumbs_b_c_defa2ed4ea8c6efabead33bce5f372f6.jpg?v=102305", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f28319992d5ad7fe9c95e27b0cd69246a0194b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tz5sLjv.6M30X0iKG7yjilNM_hdkIW31ee9S6rwALQTIOp0n8mz5v4OOCyWoH.UGa6ZPjQ2xbF011ACXg5dpJVSjmpNoH3jFeq1rxN4EBpng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "text": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019 \n\u201cThis visit will bring new business [opportunities] to both countries,\u201d says Argentinian official Ariel Cohen Sabban, President of Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association (DAIA) \nBy Nilay Kar Onum \nISTANBUL \nThe current relations between Turkey and Argentina are expected to further improve in the coming days, the head of the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association said. \nSpeaking to Anadolu Agency in Istanbul, Ariel Cohen Sabban, President of the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association (DAIA) said: \u201cWe think that the relations between Turkey and Argentina will grow from day to day.\u201d \nSabban arrived in Istanbul on Friday with an 18-person Argentinian media delegation invited by Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry together with the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEIK) for a three-day visit. \n\u201cWe are sure that this visit to Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey will bring new business [opportunities] to both countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will also bring better relations between Argentina and Turkey.\u201d \nHe stated that Turkey and Argentina were \"on the same page\" in terms of improving their ties: \u201cBoth countries want to improve and want to restart a different vision in the world.\u201d \nIn January 2017, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had paid a visit to Argentina\u2019s capital of Buenos Aires.

Police also found digital propaganda material in possession of suspects for Daesh. \nOn Marh 9, Istanbul police captured 21 Daesh militants, foiling potential attacks. The terrorist group is responsible for several attacks in Istanbul as well as other cities. In June 2016, three Daesh militants killed 45 people in an armed attack followed by suicide bombings at the city's Atat\u00fcrk Airport. Last year, during New Year's celebrations, a Daesh militant killed 39 people at a popular nightclub on the Bosporus shore. The militant was captured alive in Istanbul's Esenyurt district a few weeks later. \nAmid fears that Daesh militants who fled Syria could hit Europe and Turkey, authorities have heightened crackdowns on the terrorist group with almost daily operations. Though Daesh lost a number of its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, a controversial deal, between Daesh and Syrian terrorist groups linked to the PKK that carry out attacks against Turkey, facilitated their safe evacuation from Raqqa, Syria. \nTurkey has stopped thousands of people from trying to enter Syria to join the group over the past few years. It is now concerned with militants fleeing Iraq and Syria following the fall of the terrorist group.
