This year\u2019s event is held under the theme (Connect2Earth) under the auspices of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. Celebrating the event is part of RTA \u2019s keenness to play an active role in achieving sustainable development in Dubai, and raise the profile of the Emirate in environmental sustainability and energy saving. Nasir Abu Shehab, CEO of Strategy & Corporate Governance Sector cum Chair of Energy & Green Economy Committee at the RTA , said: \u201cThe RTA has charted out a plan for this year\u2019s Earth Hour events, which will be held today from 08:30 pm to 09:30 pm . Events include switching off 1433 streetlights in the Business Street, Al Saadah Street, Boulevard Street (Burj Khalifa), Al Mamzar Beach Street (from Boats Slipway to Al Mamzar Park), the parking lot of Shandagha Heritage Village, and Al Khaleej Street (from Elderly Home at Mamzar to Al Mamzar Park). Activities will also include local roads opposite to the sea at Jumeirah; which will save about 683.7 kilowatts.\n\u201cAs part of the Marina Promenade celebrations at the Business Bay, the RTA will run several activities including children games and contests, hydrogen-powered taxi, and a model of the bus-washing water treatment plant. Two buses will be deployed to lift participants from the Business Bay MS to the site of the event,\u201d he added. Advertisement \u201cLights and some air-conditioners will also be turned off at RTA Head Office, Main Customers Happiness Center at Umm Al Ramool, Public Transport building in addition to Al Rawiyya & Al Khawaneej stations, and Jebel Ali Bus Depot. Lights will also be switched off on the 5 th floor of the Parking Terminal of Rashidiya MS, premises of the Dubai Taxi Corporation and employees accommodation. Several Metro Stations will switch to the maintenance mode, and some conveyor belts at metro stations will cease operation. The overall saving resulting from the switching off streetlights and facilities of the RTA is expected to be in the order of 10,000 kilowatts in one hour only.\n\u201cThe active participation in Earth Hour events illustrates the special attention accorded by the RTA to environmental sustainability and energy saving. Such efforts are reflected in the achievement made by the RTA as the first government entity in the region to obtain ISO Energy Management Certification (ISO 50001) in 2013. The RTA has also introduced the Green Economy Award in 2014 and developed a comprehensive structure for the Green Economy in 2016. It has also motivated employees and companies in a bid to source innovative ideas in support of this drive,\u201d concluded Abu Shehab. \n-Ends-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "majdi abu zaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasir abu shehab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "environment & energy sustainability press release  roads & transport authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strategy & corporate governance sector cum chair of energy & green economy committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the roads & transport authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai electricity and water authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai supreme council of energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "marina promenade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T13:39:11.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f97c504af247b6f6ae7133679e302cc852c17b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7wwwhvuiNFgu7O4AVVZk_SznnWVqx6qKujH.DEBHL6HL_orMEiq_0C_XAkhOKEdN2", "site_full": "gulftoday.ae", "site": "gulftoday.ae", "site_section": "http://gulftoday.ae/pages/rss.ashx?id=28", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Local", "title": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "title_full": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "published": "2018-03-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f97c504af247b6f6ae7133679e302cc852c17b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7wwwhvuiNFgu7O4AVVZk_SznnWVqx6qKujH.DEBHL6HL_orMEiq_0C_XAkhOKEdN2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "text": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up By our business bureau Send to Friend \nDUBAI: Industrial refrigeration specialist company Al Furat has announced the setting up of a unit to build a wide range of vehicle bodies.

In the other second-leg semi-final, 9-man Al Wasl rallied to defeat Shabab Al Ahli Dubai 3-2 after the latter had gone ahead 2-1, to ensure their passage into the final with an aggregate 3-2 scoreline. The first-leg between the two Dubai clubs had ended in a scoreless stalemate.The Clarets had won the first leg 4-2 at Al Nahyan Stadium, but found that their two-goal advantage had vanished within five minutes.Dibba got off to a flyer when Diogo da Silva\u2019s shot was parried by goalkeeper Rashed Ali but Rodolfo da Silva finished the rebound from close range into the empty net, giving the hosts the lead less than 60 seconds into the game.Dibba added a second blow to Al Wahda as Rodolfo da Silva doubled their lead in the fourth minute, heading home Ahmed Rashed\u2019s right footed cross.The visitors got back into the game in the 18th minute as Sebastian Tagliabue took advantage of Dibba\u2019s defenders poor clearance and controlled the ball inside the box before applying a spectacular back-heel finish into the net.Mourad Batna equalised the score 12 minutes before the break when the goalkeeper blocked Tagliabue\u2019s shot into his path and the Moroccan finished the ball into the empty goal.The hosts took the lead again when captain Driss Feltouhi dribbled on the right flank before sending a golden pass to Sanad Ali to tap in Dibba\u2019s third goal three minutes into the second half. Dibba suffered a blow at the hour mark as they had to complete the match with ten players after dismissal of Yasser Salem who received his second yellow card.Tagliabue equalised for Al Wahda in the 90th minute after a solo effort before completing his hat-trick in the dying seconds, sweeping home Mohammed Al Shehhi\u2019s cross to ensure Al Wahda win the reverse fixture 4-3 and advance to the final.In the second semi-final second-leg match played at the Zabeel Stadium in Dubai, Al Ahli took an early lead when Abdalla Saleh scored in the 14th minute of the game.However, almost immediately, Shabab Al Ahli restored parity after a Mohammed Ismail pass saw Ismail Al Hammadi help his club draw level with a goal in the 16th minute of play.The first half ended with the teams locked at 1-1.In the 72nd minute, Shabab went ahead with a goal from Anber Esmail. They looked to have one leg in the final when Al Wasl\u2019s Abdulrahman Ali was given the marching orders after a second yellow card.However, two goals in the dying minutes of the game, one in the 87th minute Humaid Abdulla Abbas, and the second coming in injury time \u2014 from star striker Caio \u2014 ensured 9-man Al Wasl\u2019s passage into the final.

Doing so serves the Municipality\u2019s objectives to address current and future waste-related challenges and maintains sustainability.Dawood Abdul Rahman Abdullah Al Hajiri, Director-General of Dubai Municipality, said, \"The project represents a significant step forward that will cement Dubai\u2019s leading global position. The Dubai Municipality plays a key role in the project, as it is commits to organising and managing services in order to ensure they meet the highest standards. We must face the challenges and strive to meet the project\u2019s strategic goals, which seek to make Dubai the first and only city in the world to use artificial intelligence in transporting and processing waste to generate clean and sustainable energy.\"\"The Dubai Municipality has set an action plan to implement the project immediately after the launch; the plan was titled \u2018The Vision of the Future City, Today\u2019,\" Al Hajiri revealed. \"To that end, we formed a task force consisting of young, passionate and driven Emiratis to carry out this initiative, and firmly establish the global leadership of the Dubai Municipality. We are working to create an ecosystem that embraces change and disruption, and a smart, flexible environment that engages both the public and private sectors, as well as the general public, to implement the services of the future.\"The initiative consists of developing a world-first, decentralised waste-treatment platform for buildings and residential districts in Dubai. The system uses technology developed by Dubai Municipality to treat all types of solid waste after sorting them using artificial intelligence, AI, and smart technologies. The decentralised units raise the temperature of the waste resulting in the breakdown of its chemical components, producing clean electrical energy that will be exported to the local electricity grid.The initiative is a continuation of the Dubai Municipality\u2019s project to convert solid waste into energy; the project includes building the world\u2019s largest energy terminal in terms of production capacity and thermal conversion efficiency. This, in turn, contributes to the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Master Plan, which seeks to steer 100 percent of the city\u2019s waste away from landfills by the year 2030.The project includes carefully analysing the statistics pertaining to waste and the high costs of collection and treatment, in addition to the environmental disadvantages of harmful emissions from Dubai\u2019s landfills. It increases the Municipality\u2019s efficiency by reducing operational costs, eliminates the environmental footprint of buried waste, and prevents loss of land to landfills.As it stands, the Emirate of Dubai produces 3.5 million tonnes of waste annually, uses 7,560 square metres of land as landfills, deploys 3,850 garbage collection vehicles to all its districts, all at a daily operating cost of Dhs2.3 million.Once implemented, the Wastenizer system will produce 17,500 tonnes of good ash for the production of green concrete. The Municipality is working in partnership with local and international companies specializing in artificial intelligence, infrastructure, and waste-to-energy, transportation, in addition to major real estate and property developers, in order to execute the ambitious project. Implementation began with research and development in the fourth quarter of 2017, before moving on to forging strategic agreements with potential partners from the private sector in Q1 2018. The pilot phase of the project has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2018, with the system entering full implementation in several regions of the emirate just before the opening of Expo 2020.Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Chairman of Dubai Executive Council and Chairman of DFF\u2019s Board of Trustees, launched the bold plan, among several avant-garde proposals for Dubai 10X at the 6th World Government Summit, held in Dubai in February 2018. The Dubai 10X initiative seeks to place Dubai Government entities ten years ahead of the rest of the world in all sectors, propelling the emirate into the future by implementing today what other cities around the world will be implementing ten years from now.Sheikh Hamdan approved 26 projects presented by 24 government entities. The shortlisted projects were evaluated by a panel of experts out of a total of more than 160 ideas submitted by 36 parties in less than 365 days.WAM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abdul rahman abdullah al hajiri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dubai future foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai municipality", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T17:42:58.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1a44eaf13681b2587ea63c0e8c1208a2b835dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ7JHmj3BdM22ExilywwIQ.v8rkPd_LD7XQLzNAC9dpHBHoBriuXFxiMgE_Y.okLtL3A5tV.xGASzVsomEizfWM_HtWtx_5clQiBW6Uz6614EW4KNXdCWSVwfqLRkYItD6GwBfEkyc9JYkeCZHf5Qezzklj54jTtBKWSUwNqJPAoQmfOdKvgkyBMROuNGeKrNoyw0BnKn6h4dco9UzZdg7j", "site_full": "www.zawya.com", "site": "zawya.com", "site_section": "http://www.zawya.com/rss/pr.cfm?section=2", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Zawya.com - Press Releases - Companies News", "title": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "title_full": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "published": "2018-03-24T08:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.zawya.com/pr/images/2018/dc_2018_03_24.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1a44eaf13681b2587ea63c0e8c1208a2b835dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ7JHmj3BdM22ExilywwIQ.v8rkPd_LD7XQLzNAC9dpHBHoBriuXFxiMgE_Y.okLtL3A5tV.xGASzVsomEizfWM_HtWtx_5clQiBW6Uz6614EW4KNXdCWSVwfqLRkYItD6GwBfEkyc9JYkeCZHf5Qezzklj54jTtBKWSUwNqJPAoQmfOdKvgkyBMROuNGeKrNoyw0BnKn6h4dco9UzZdg7j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T08:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "text": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai Press Release \nDubai, United Arab Emirates: Dubai Culture & Arts Authority (Dubai Culture), the Emirate\u2019s dedicated entity for culture, arts and heritage, is engaging the public to involve them in strengthening its innovative \u2018Dubai ArtBank\u2019 initiative during the 12 th edition of Art Dubai, which runs from 21 st to 24 th March 2018. \nThe \u2018Dubai ArtBank\u2019 will introduce an innovative new model for managing art collections and transacting in creativity and art as bankable assets through a new Dubai Art crypto-currency.

It is a motorcycle that has been very much on its own journey, growing in physical size and displacement over the decades, all the while creating an enduring and unrivalled reputation for luxury, quality and comfort. It has amassed a huge fan base here in the UAE and numbers grow each year, with the riders wanting to be part of the Gold Wing heritage. The 2018 GL1800 Gold Wing takes a new direction and is brand new from the wheels-up. It still has an evocative, flat six-cylinder engine that delivers an avalanche of torque and power, and it still remains Honda\u2019s flagship premium tourer, loaded with features that allow two people to ride in style. Yet it\u2019s smaller, much lighter and much more agile \u2013 very much a true \u2018rider\u2019s motorcycle\u2019.\nSharing a common engine and chassis platform, the new \u2018Wing will be available as the base model GL1800 Gold Wing, and as a \u2018Tour\u2019 edition with top box, which will also offer a version equipped with DCT and air bag. Depending on the variant, up to 48kg has been saved compared to the previous model. Advertisement Optimised for size, the new flat six-cylinder engine has lost none of its power, torque and addictive delivery. Throttle By Wire has been added, with 4 rider modes; TOUR, SPORT, ECON and RAIN. Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) maintains rear wheel traction while the suspension damping and Combined Brake System (CBS) alter depending on mode selected. Hill Start Assist (HSA) and Idling Stop add ease of use and improve fuel efficiency.\nThe manual transmission is now 6-speed, while the new Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) features 7-speeds, with clutch feel, shift speed and rpm range of up/downshifts tailored specifically to each riding mode. It also features a creep forward and back function. The manual machine employs the same reverse system as the previous design. \nThe performance improvement is matched by even greater levels of relaxation: the stylish, aerodynamically-efficient fairing channels air around the rider and the electric screen adjusts for preference; the seats provide all-day comfort. New features like the smart key system, Apple CarPlay and Bluetooth connectivity bring even more convenience. \nSTYLING & EQUIPMENT \nThe new Gold Wing is a completely different proposition and replaces the relaxed lines of the outgoing model with a more honed, athletic ethos. \nAlso on display is the motorcycle itself \u2013 the double wishbone front suspension, flat six-cylinder engine, exhausts \u2013 in all their functional beauty. Drawn together the design elements create cutting edge style, underpinned by incredible levels of engineering and electronics. \nScreen angle and height adjustment is step-less. Available as options are a larger screen, a fully-adjustable deflector for the arms and upper body and fixed deflectors for the lower legs and feet. \nAll lighting is LED. The lower portion of the headlights use five polished optical lenses on both sides to create a Jewel-Eye low beam light signature. Using high beam (in the upper portion) creates a stereoscopic impression. The front indicators are housed in the mirrors and the indicators also auto-cancel; the system compares front and rear wheel speed difference and calculates when to cancel the indication relative to the riding situation. \nThe rear top box of the \u2018Tour\u2019 versions will hold two full-face helmets; combined with the panniers 110L storage capacity is available. \nCapacity of the fuel tank is 4 litres less at 21 litres. But as the new Gold Wing is so much lighter and more aerodynamic, improved fuel economy of 5.6 litres/100km means tank range is similar to the previous design. \nLuxurious instrumentation creates a unique cockpit. Different low-contrast colours with dark tones are applied to the dials, of which the peripheral areas form cone-shaped slopes to create a feeling of depth. A ring with a metal texture surrounds each dial, and the graduations glow in LED, giving concrete depth and a calm, cool image. \nThe 7-inch full-color TFT liquid crystal display screen provides infotainment-related information (for the audio systems) as well as managing the HSTC and suspension adjustment. Information is displayed in differentiated segments in a very functional order, so the rider can get all the relevant data with the minimum of eye movement. \nOperation of the luggage is simplified. With the smart key present a push button opens the panniers and top box. It is also possible to temporarily unlock the luggage via remote control; the unlock button on the smart key enables the passenger to instantly access the saddlebags and the rear luggage box. Hydraulic dampers smooth the opening and closing. Pushing and holding the call button results in the indicators flashing. \nThe Gold Wing is now compatible with Apple CarPlay, so the rider can utilise the personalised information and content inside their iPhone, such as telephone numbers and music playlists. Bluetooth connectivity has been adopted and a USB cable can also be plugged in. \nCHASSIS \nThe new Gold Wing\u2019s die-cast aluminium twin beam frame is designed to package the engine in a tighter space, 40mm further forward. Its structural thickness has been optimised in each area to deliver a smooth and stable ride, from walking speed upwards, whether on tight city streets or out on the open road. The frame and swingarm together are 2kg lighter than the previous design. \nRear spring preload is also now electrically adjusted. It\u2019s an intuitive \u2013 rather than numerical \u2013 system. Separate from the four riding modes, there are four settings of preload relative to load from soft to hard: single rider; rider with luggage; rider with pillion, and rider with pillion fully loaded with luggage. The setting is displayed on the TFT screen and adjusted via switch. \nENGINE \nCore to the previous Gold Wing\u2019s appeal was its turbine-smooth flat six-cylinder engine, which produced torque from low rpm with a distinctive power delivery and feel that quickly became addictive. \nTo realise the handling ambitions of the new chassis the 1,833cc engine too has been redrawn. Still as a horizontally-opposed flat six, but now with four valves per cylinder rather than two, much more compact in size and 6.2kg lighter. \nPeak power of 93kW arrives @ 5,500rpm, with peak torque of 170Nm delivered @ 4,500rpm. The bore size of 73mm (from 74mm) has been optimised to stroke of 73mm and bore pitch shortened 9mm; the left and right cylinders are offset 4mm and the cylinder sleeves are now aluminium. Compression ratio is set at 10.5:1. \nTOUR mode is the base setting for comfort and power. It gives a direct 100% opening ratio between throttle grip and throttle body butterfly, with \u2018default\u2019 damping and front/rear brake force distribution. \nSPORT serves up the highest throttle to butterfly ratio and delivers strong acceleration, with firmer damping and rear brake lever pressure. \nECON mode offers maximum fuel economy and easy cruising, with lower throttle to butterfly ratio and default damping and brake force. \nRAIN turns the dial down to suit wet and slippery conditions, with lowest throttle to butterfly ratio, default braking force distribution and soft suspension damping. \nIn all four riding modes HSTC constantly allows controllable acceleration in slippery conditions. \nTo complement the engine\u2019s deep bass signature the exhausts now emit a powerful throb, without excessive noise. The cross-sectional areas of the exhaust pipes have been reduced 20% for two out of the six cylinders, bringing about the change in sound volume and depth. \nThe ISG (Integrated Starter Generator) combines the generator and starter motor into one component, with the generator effectively becoming the starter motor when supplied with reverse power. \nKey characteristics of the Idling Stop system are the ultra-quiet start-up of the engine thanks to the use of ISG, and the smooth starting feeling achieved through a combination of DCT and TBW control. When stopping at a traffic light with the Idling Stop system on, the engine automatically stops after three seconds and, when restarting, the rider only needs to turn the throttle, which immediately starts the engine. \nHill starts on a conventional motorcycle often involve simultaneously releasing the brakes, opening the throttle and engaging the clutch according to the grade of the slope. To ease this effort, the new manual transmission Gold Wing has adopted Hill Start Assist (HSA). \nThe new 6-speed manual gearbox lowers the engine speed when cruising at 100km/h, compared to the previous 5-speed design. It\u2019s also fitted with a \u2018cam damper\u2019 between the clutch and transmission, separating each inertial mass, reducing noise and improving shift quality/durability. \nDUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION \nHonda\u2019s unique Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) is a natural fit for the new Gold Wing engine and development revolved around DCT as the base. This is the third all-new generation of the system and the first to have 7-speeds, specifically designed for long-distance cruising; it\u2019s also extremely smooth and fast shifting. And lighter than the 5-speed manual transmission fitted to the previous design. \nThe new Gold Wing\u2019s DCT features a 1.8km/h forward Walking Mode with reverse of 1.2km/h, operated instantly from a +/- switch on the left handlebar. \nThe all-new Goldwing is available at Al-Futtaim Honda showrooms across the UAE and retails from AED 109,900. \nFor more information, call 800 HONDA (46632) or visit http://www.honda.ae. \nAbout Al-Futtaim Honda \nAl-Futtaim Honda, part of Al-Futtaim Automotive, is the sole distributor for Honda vehicles, motorcycles, marine engines, power products and parts.

Infrastructure respondents also expect to partner with tech firms with over half of the infrastructure respondents, an increase of circa 50 per cent, anticipating a joint venture in the next three years. Nick Ogden, infrastructure expert and Partner at Pinsent Masons, commented: \"For investors, having technology providers play a leadership role means there are real incentives motivating them to provide the best technology and speed up delivery. Our survey shows that 92 per cent of infrastructure investors will often or always consider technology when making investment decisions over the next three years. This shows that investors are willing to spend the money which will drive this growing trend. Collaboration is already here, and is only going to increase. On projects where infrastructure and technology are truly integrated, you can imagine there is the potential not just to create more efficient assets but also create new markets that haven't existed before.\"\nThere are, however, obstacles with this convergence. Both infrastructure and technology respondents cited overcoming cultural differences as the main challenge to Infratech projects once initiated and 37 per cent of respondents thought that the siloed approach to both sectors was a major barrier. Advertisement \"Infrastructure needs to learn from tech firms and start changing from the inside-out by bringing technology into all aspects of their operation. Both sectors will need to bring together their commercial objectives, whilst understanding each other's varied risk appetites, commercial drivers and business models,\" Ogden added.\nAgreeing data requirements and standards was identified in the research as the second biggest challenge for projects where technology and infrastructure are integrated, with regulatory constraints ranking in third place. A clear majority of respondents, 91 per cent, prefer an open access model with ownership of any data captured by Infratech. However, the same respondents report that data captured by Infratech is available to all in just 62 per cent of the projects they work on. \nBill Smith, Dubai-based Infrastructure Partner at Pinsent Masons, commented: \"Clear leadership is needed from governments to ensure that data and information security regulations are fit for purpose in order for the benefits of Infratech to be fully maximised. Despite the rapid pace of technological change and digital disruption, the UAE is a prime example of how beneficial Infratech can be when clear guidelines are put into place.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe clear vision of both His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and the Dubai Government is to firmly cement Dubai's place as a world-leading smart city. Under their stewardship, we have seen Dubai take a leading role in embracing Infratech for the benefit of its residents: for example, by the establishment of Smart Dubai Government (SDG) whose express mission is to 'deliver world-class smart services and infrastructure to create happiness '. This statement encapsulates the very essence of Infratech, and what it is intended to deliver into the future.\" \nInterestingly, the report shows that monetising data from infrastructure comes fairly low on the list of ways Infratech is seen as adding value, mentioned by only 21% of all respondents. However, Pinsent Masons' view is that data will have significant potential as a revenue generator and its value must not be overlooked. \n\"Data monetisation will become a more significant feature for those involved in Infratech, particularly once the opportunities and risks are better understood by the Infratech ecosystem, and robust data sharing arrangements and data standards are in place to support emerging business models,\" added Simon Colvin, Technology Partner at Pinsent Masons. \"Across our global markets, we are seeing interesting PPP models emerge that incorporate data monetisation as part of the financial base case, so the success of the project will depend on revenue streams from data generated by project assets. This underlines the views of the investors, that there are new revenue streams and value to be driven out from this digital and data transformation,\" he concluded. \n'The Evolution of Infratech' report is produced in association with the Institution of Civil Engineers, techUK and Mergermarket. In total, 300 people were surveyed, including direct equity investors in the infrastructure sector and senior-level executives from the infrastructure and technology/ communications provider sectors. Respondent companies were all global leaders in their fields and include those listed on FTSE 100, Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Korea Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and NYSE, among others. \nThe companies involved were split between the UK, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. The survey included a combination of qualitative and quantitative questions, and all interviews were conducted over the telephone by appointment. Results were analysed and collated by Acuris andPinsent Masons, and all responses are anonymised and presented in aggregate. \nAdditional in-depth interviews were conducted with experts and executives from a selection of infrastructure and technology firms, as well as universities and public-sector bodies. The findings were also discussed at a roundtable event with senior representatives from a range of stakeholders. The results of all the interviews and the roundtable helped inform the core messages of the report. \nAbout Pinsent Masons \n\nPinsent Masons is a global 100 law firm, specialising particularly in the energy, infrastructure,   advanced manufacturing and technology sectors.
