By way of comparison, Austrian construction output is six times higher than Hungarian, with the same number of employees, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Koji, president of the National Federation of Hungarian Building Contractors (\u00c9VOSZ), told a conference in Budapest. \nIf we compare the construction sector in Hungary with Austria and the Czech Republic - countries of roughly the same size - the figures show a significant difference. Austria reached six times higher production in 2016 with a similar number of employees, while construction output in the Czech Republic was three times greater. \nThe biggest problem is efficiency, said Koji at the conference hosted by business news daily Vil\u00e1ggazdas\u00e1g. In the last 10 years, services and capacities in construction were barely needed, and the sudden growth in demand has caught the sector by surprise, he observed. \nThe current situation on the construction market will force players to improve efficiency, Koji predicted. The value of output in the construction industry reached HUF 2,500 billion last year, which is a nearly 30% increase year-on-year. \nAs for construction prices, these have risen by 5.2%, and by 10-12% for home construction, Koji noted. While it is true that home prices have grown much faster than this rate, the causes for this are not related to the construction sector, he added. \nWhile last year wages in the construction sector grew by 13.1%, this is still not enough to attract a sufficient labor force, which remains the major obstacle to the further expansion of the sector, according to a poll conducted by \u00c9VOSZ.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hungari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u00e1szl\u00f3 koji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vil\u00e1ggazdas\u00e1g", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national federation of hungarian building contractors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:49:19.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8671e1972c57daf619a60f4b55b66f6d6f47cd58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyreUxL3bSFy.RoMYvxSC.oGTf4jc4eHn21XcfX695Ufb00lo17.KM4h7wYkARW3BHYZ7VB_14nvN4nhH7XB7GDoonIILfJOLA-", "site_full": "friss-hirek.hu", "site": "friss-hirek.hu", "site_section": "http://friss-hirek.hu/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Friss-hirek.hu", "title": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "title_full": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "published": "2018-03-23T18:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8671e1972c57daf619a60f4b55b66f6d6f47cd58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyreUxL3bSFy.RoMYvxSC.oGTf4jc4eHn21XcfX695Ufb00lo17.KM4h7wYkARW3BHYZ7VB_14nvN4nhH7XB7GDoonIILfJOLA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T18:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "text": "Megd\u0139\u0091lt a budapesti hidegrekord a csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160n - Index Google H\u0102\u00adrek - Vezet\u0139\u0091 h\u0102\u00adrek (2 nappal ezel\u0139\u0091tt) - IndexMegd\u0139\u0091lt a budapesti hidegrekord a csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160nIndexA csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160n Budapesten megd\u0139\u0091lt a legalacsonyabb maximumh\u0139\u0091m\u0102\u0160rs\u0102\u0160klet rekordja - k\u0102\u015bz\u0102\u015blte az Orsz\u0102\u0104gos Meteorol\u0102\u0142giai Szolg\u0102\u0104lat az MTI-vel. 1964. m\u0102\u0104rcius 20-\u0102\u0104n Budapest Csillagda...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:48:29.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d8051e02239ca3bce74d68c6ac2f16eff12d04a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg97..stVESPcGWHZTj8aWoxAfDSXIg5dsBIMED1FPxi6lB6DjHbyXiRnigB8BjhPfyRIAdM12d21kCaLNDv1FVkJ9s3hXvRGbPFvdAXOf9JFt.1a_1hqm3m", "site_full": "www.portfolio.hu", "site": "portfolio.hu", "site_section": "http://www.portfolio.hu/en/rss/cikkek/all.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "PORTFOLIO.HU - Online Financial Journal", "title": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "title_full": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "published": "2018-03-23T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.portfolio.hu/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14146, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d8051e02239ca3bce74d68c6ac2f16eff12d04a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg97..stVESPcGWHZTj8aWoxAfDSXIg5dsBIMED1FPxi6lB6DjHbyXiRnigB8BjhPfyRIAdM12d21kCaLNDv1FVkJ9s3hXvRGbPFvdAXOf9JFt.1a_1hqm3m", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "text": "March 23, 2018, 12:12 pm vision 1/A World Championships with a fan village and gastro area as well.

With only 2 points separating the young riders, there will be no place for pressure as the one finishing ahead of the other will win it all. At this stage, Bincaz is leading the race, but after his fantastic victory last week in Paris, Busto is coming to Hungary with a high level of confidence, determined to swap positions at the best moment. Not only the show will see the best riders in the world evolve and keep balance on impressively high and technical structures, but it will also offer to the spectators another dose of adrenaline with the performance during the break of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 \u201cHEGE\u201d Heged\u0171s, 20-time Hungarian trial bicycle champion and Guiness Book world record holder.
