Longest long-haul flights Auckland\u2014Dubai: 17 hours, 25 minutes Perth to London: 17 hours Dallas/Fort Worth\u2014Sydney: 16 hours, 55 minutes Johannesburg\u2014Atlanta: 16 hours, 50 minutes San Francisco\u2014Singapore: 16 hours, 30 minutes Abu Dhabi\u2014Los Angeles: 16 hours, 30 minutes \nWith Qantas launching its 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London this weekend, passengers are now facing one of the longest treks in commercial aviation. \nFlights of this length are not unheard of, with routes from Houston and Dallas to Sydney and direct services such as Los Angeles to Singapore and Auckland to Dubai already on offer for travellers wanting to trade a stopover or two for a direct service. \nAnd while the destinations might differ, the problems rarely do: how do you keep yourself feeling human after three-quarters of a day stuck in a metal tube. \nHere are some tips from the experts on how to cope with spending so long in a confined space. External Link: Nicolas Cage tastes sweet freedom after stepping off a plane in Con Air The doctor \nDry lips, nose, mouth and eyes \u2014 and don't forget the sometimes debilitating jetlag \u2014 are among the most common issues long-haul flyers can expect, according to travel doctor Sandy Dunne. \nBut she points to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot in the leg veins, as the thing flyers should be most mindful of. \nDr Dunne said some people were at higher risk of DVT, including: People who have had DVT previously Women who are pregnant or on female hormone replacement therapy Individuals who are either very tall or short, as well as obese people People who have had recent surgery, or anyone unable to walk around during a flight Photo: Qantas says seats in the economy cabin are roomier. (Supplied: Qantas) \nShe recommends that anyone who is at heightened risk consult a travel doctor ahead of their flight. \nDr Dunne said travellers should ensure they stay well hydrated, and take practical steps to minimise the impact of dryness, such as packing lip balm and eye drops. \nShe strongly advises against using sleeping pills on flights. \n\"If you are drugged out on a sleeping tablet you can stay in one position for a long time and that can increase your risk of DVT,\" she said. The psychologist \nEnvironmental psychologist Rob Hall said airports and, by extension, planes could be places that drew strong emotional responses from people, especially those who were anxious about flying or who were leaving loved ones behind. \nDr Hall said the ultra long-haul experience could take its own particular toll on people, with time disorientation, fatigue, irritability and even the disruption of a person's rhythm of going to the bathroom potentially affecting a passenger's emotional state. Photo: Business class and premium economy seats take up more than half the plane between them. (Supplied: Qantas) \nHe said it was important people find something to keep their mind occupied and find a way to keep moving, even through in-seat exercises \u2014 for which many airlines provide 'how-to' guides. \n\"If you are going on a very long flight, it is worth having a little mental checklist and saying, 'OK, at least once an hour I'll do all these waggly exercises, I'll stand up and maybe walk up and down the aisle once or twice',\" Dr Hall said. \n\"They help you to burn off a bit of muscular energy \u2026 and they protect you from things like deep vein thrombosis.\" The pilot \nCaptain Brad Hodson, Australian and International Pilots Association acting president, said passengers not knowing what to expect might actually be surprised by how quickly time could pass on a long-haul flight. Photo: Captain Brad Hodson says a bit of respect goes a long way on a long flight. (Supplied: AIPA) \n\"You just have to turn up pretty well rested, drink a lot of water, try not to drink too much alcohol and try to sleep when you can,\" he said. \nCaptain Hodson said with the passengers stuck in the same space for so long, treating each other well was important for ensuring a smooth experience. \n\"Obviously people will want to get up and stretch their legs and that sort of thing, so it will take a bit of respect for each other to ensure that functions reasonably well,\" he said. \n\"Most of the people who will do this flight are probably seasoned travellers, and will do it because it gets them to their destination quicker than they otherwise would have [on an indirect route].\" \nLong-haul routes such as Perth to London are made more manageable for crews with the presence of four pilots on the aircraft, allowing two at a time extended rest periods in designated sleeping areas. \n\"You are able to sleep in them a lot better than you would in a business class seat because they are quieter, they are more comfortable,\" Captain Hodson said.

(Supplied: Qantas) The airline \nQantas claims it has made the long-haul flight more pleasant for travellers by offering a more spacious cabin, with 236 seats on its Boeing 787-9 aircraft \u2014 as opposed to the more than 300 seats squeezed in by other airlines. \nBut the airline also had to take fuel capacity into account when deciding how many passengers and how much luggage the aircraft could carry over such a long distance. \nMuch of the lower density is because of the high number of business class and premium economy seats Qantas has opted for \u2014 with those cabins taking up more than half the plane between them. External Link: More than half the Qantas 787s are business and first class \nBut the airline has also promised a \"roomier\" economy seat. \nQantas itself recommends wearing comfortable clothing, charging personal electronic devices in advance and bringing your own snacks and basic plane-friendly toiletries to make a long-haul trip more enjoyable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "qantas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas/fort worth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:30:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9a9f643ac435eec38509fe5ed54c58edcfb6e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1ETZHqcCzAolw3fQ.bMkCpJOQCG_o_E64csJUhpwxvTX9DkFmbtL5ENcqQWdHi4qJGfvHiSwV_mOePhqCDIlRYollKLM7bLIia4jOHcqCnZnBCi8To8Slfg--", "site_full": "au.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Qantas debuts direct flights from Perth to London", "title_full": "Qantas debuts direct flights from Perth to London", "published": "2018-03-22T22:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.816, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/O6pz17VRF44RFRGX0ERTuQ--~D/cm90YXRlPWF1dG87Zmk9ZmlsbDtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVv/https://s.yimg.com/ea/img/-/180323/5ab417eb45101_630x355_2355397.png", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1759, "comments": 0, "shares": 1759}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9a9f643ac435eec38509fe5ed54c58edcfb6e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1ETZHqcCzAolw3fQ.bMkCpJOQCG_o_E64csJUhpwxvTX9DkFmbtL5ENcqQWdHi4qJGfvHiSwV_mOePhqCDIlRYollKLM7bLIia4jOHcqCnZnBCi8To8Slfg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T22:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Qantas debuts direct flights from Perth to London", "text": "Qantas debuts direct flights from Perth to London \nDreamliner Captain Lisa Norman is at the helm of the historic first flight.

Big job to remove dozens of carcasses \nThe DBCA is working with the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River to remove the dead whales from the beach. \nDNA samples are being taken from the deceased whales to try to determine why the whales became stranded. \nIt will be the local shire's responsibility to dispose of the whale carcasses, which are already creating a powerful smell.

(ABC News: Megan Morris) \nDBCA wildlife officer Pia Courtis said the team was waiting on an excavator to arrive at the beach to be able to save the whales which are still alive. \nDozens of volunteers and wildlife officers will remain there overnight, or for as long as it takes to move the whales to the boat ramp and safely push them back out to sea. \n\"The plan is to get the excavator down here and move the live ones to an area closer to the boat ramp,\" Ms Courtis said. \"Hopefully we'll refloat them and send them back out as a group.\" \nShe said they had no indication of when that might be. \n\"At the moment we've got officers and volunteers down there and they're stabilising the whales,\" she said. \n\"Of course for us our biggest concern is them being out of the water and sunburn.

More than 20 whales were also stranded in the South West town of Bunbury in 2015. \nThe biggest mass stranding of whales in WA was in Dunsborough in 1996, when 320 long-finned pilot whales beached themselves. \n\"The South West capes area has had a number of incidents over the years of stranding of short fin and long fin pilot whales, so they're a species that are common in terms of a stranding scenario,\" Mr Tannock said. \nShort-finned pilot whales can grow to up to 5.5 metres long and are occasionally seen in groups as large as several hundred, but more commonly travel in groups of less than 100. \nThey are brownish-grey to black with a pinkish-grey anchor shape on the undersides, and inhabit tropical and sub-tropical waters, according to DBCA.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy chick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamelin bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leaarne hollowood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of fisheries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of biodiversity", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "augusta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamelin bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T06:08:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b99ced551250ff4f0e57f3e8e1c29d1ff62a9105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i.hp0SI6CFFVm_p_QJuinfcgggEWbR8SdgCVrI7xEhNWgmPrCkEglyMs.1_WsmDkMhvDC3Ehp5mg4LlUZQtNxtN", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au//news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "Do you think midwives are all women?

Family were really supportive, obviously it was our choice,\" she said. \n\"But we were never uncomfortable at all.\" \nMs McQuire said Mr Wright also helped to involve her husband, Jaime, in the birth. \n\"He doesn't quite get the whole birth thing, as a lot of males don't, but Christian really made him get involved and throughout the whole process made sure Jaime was comfortable with what we were hoping to achieve with the birth,\" she said. \n\"It would be good if there were more male midwives. It does make it more relatable to the partners and a better experience.\" \nMs McQuire said her family had developed a close relationship with Mr Wright after the birth of Archer, and he even attended their wedding last year. \n\"We consider him a good friend, not just a midwife,\" she said. The learning curve: 'It blew my mind' \nMr Wright, who has been named as one of the finalists in the 2018 WA Nursing and Midwifery Excellence Awards in the Graduate of the Year category, said he went into the profession with the aim of one day working in developing countries. \n\"I've worked in East Timor and I've done some work in remote areas in Australia, in communities, and I just love it,\" he said.

(ABC News: Alisha O'Flaherty) \n\"I love being with the community, with people in their setting \u2026 I just really love investing in people and seeing what they can achieve.\" \nMr Wright said he believed the reason so few men went into midwifery was because they did not understand it. \n\"It's a course taught by women, for women, about women, and I really struggled for the first six months,\" he said. \n\"But when I realised what I was learning, it blew my mind. \n\"I think if more guys understood what it was, they would be coming into it.\" Not just 'women's business' \nStatistics from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia show that at the end of December, there were 40 men registered as a nurse and midwife in WA as their principal place of practice, and 467 across Australia.

Figures on the number of women choosing to freebirth are not collated, but researchers and midwives believe it's on the rise. \nAnother 17 men were registered as midwives alone across Australia, with none in WA. \nEdith Cowan University associate professor and associate dean of midwifery, Sara Bayes, said it was a profession that struggled to attract men, with some continuing to view it as \"women's business\". \n\"We probably have one or two per cohort in both of our programs here,\" Dr Bayes said. \n\"The guys who do come into it have a really strong reason for doing it, and that might be that they've had not such a great experience themselves, that they have a genuine wish to support women through a life changing experience or they have very practical reasons, like they might want to go and work for RFDS [the Royal Flying Doctor Service] and that is one of the skills that they need.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian wright", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kemh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king edward memorial hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T02:55:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2aa7913586b5d46ca130670b6bf5a8d6f8d63465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37wLxb.Tss8d.xNLLxuoubhRD76UmSjgHhOul4G9_ka51gvsunexYIgJ7dBwInSw_u_3rq5lUmvnIM5L.Eq1OvO7t.Uncq0ZJAI5xw.50oLC5y3RCfsAOp__IRezVpN31cayvjt_QtsnQw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald - Latest News", "title": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "title_full": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "published": "2018-03-24T07:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_auto/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/18a231c0e9f5ee2f4167624f2934d8d0683ee16c", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1691, "comments": 0, "shares": 1691}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2aa7913586b5d46ca130670b6bf5a8d6f8d63465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37wLxb.Tss8d.xNLLxuoubhRD76UmSjgHhOul4G9_ka51gvsunexYIgJ7dBwInSw_u_3rq5lUmvnIM5L.Eq1OvO7t.Uncq0ZJAI5xw.50oLC5y3RCfsAOp__IRezVpN31cayvjt_QtsnQw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrick Hatch", "published": "2018-03-24T07:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "text": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight By Patrick Hatch Larger text size Very large text size Aviation history is set to be made on Saturday night as Qantas prepares to launch the first-ever non-stop commercial service connecting Australia and Europe. Flight QF9 is due to take off from Perth just before 7pm (10pm eastern time) and is expected to touch down in London just over 17 hours later. The flight will take about 17 hours and 20 minutes. Photo: Brent Winstone/ Qantas Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the service would change Australian aviation forever by connecting \u201cthe last two continents in the world that don\u2019t have a direct link\u201d. \u201cThis is a truly historic flight that opens up a new era of travel. For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link,\u201d Mr Joyce said. \u201cThe original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947. Now we can do it in a single leap.\u201d Advertisement The service operated by Qantas\u2019 first four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners saves about three hours by removing the need to stop over in places such as Dubai or Singapore. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. Photo: Kate Geraghty The flight originates in Melbourne, with those passengers saving about an hour compared to other routes to London. At 14,498 kilometres the journey will be the world\u2019s third-longest service in operation. Qatar Airways\u2019 Doha to Auckland service spans 14,535 kilometres, while Air India\u2019s Delhi to San Francisco service can be shorter or longer than Qantas\u2019 new route (up to 15,127 kilometres) depending on which flight path it takes. Loading The Dreamliners carry up to 236 passengers, which is about half the number on the Airbus A380 Super Jumbos that have until now dominated travel between Australia and Europe, with 70 seats reserved for business and premium class customers. Rico Merkert, an aviation expert at the University of Sydney Business School, said Qantas was trying to attract lucrative corporate travellers with a product that was more comfortable and which saved them time. Qantas can charge more for this premium offering and improve profitability in its international operations, which has been its weakest business unit in recent years during a period of record-low international fares sparked by fierce competition. \u201cTwo hours is worth a lot of money to some of these business people,\u201d Professor Merket said. The Perth-London service will also be a testing ground for Qantas as it moves into an era of ultra-long haul flights. The carrier hopes to be flying non-stop from Sydney and Melbourne to destinations including London and New York by as soon as 2022. Those marathon journeys are beyond the range of Qantas\u2019 Dreamliners, and so the airline is looking to buy either Boeing\u2019s 777-8X or Airbus\u2019 A350-900. As it pushes air travel to unprecedented limits, Qantas is investigating how to alleviate the effects of endurance travel on passengers through a partnership with the Charles Perkins Centre\u2019s Sydney Medical School. Ten passengers will have their body movement and sleep activity monitored during the flight to test how specially designed lighting and the timing of meal services affects them.

Prestipino 24 March 2018 \u2014 12:11pm Emerging Swan Valley distillery Old Young's has smoked the competition again, named best distillery in Australia for the second consecutive year.\nThe one-man band is orchestrated by former sports administrator and marketer James Young, who operates out of a 36sqm shed in the traditional winemaking region just north of Perth.\nThe craft spirits specialist was also awarded two gold medals at the 2018 Australian Distilled Spirit Awards in Melbourne, one for its Six Seasons Gin for the second year running and another for its Common Gin, a new product launched only last Monday.\nJames Young at his Swan Valley distillery and cellar door.\nPhoto: Supplied Entries from the 86 exhibitors were up 20 per cent on last year, with 297 in total, the majority (130) of which were gin, with 24 gold medals being awarded .\nOld Young's triumph is considerable given its short shelf life but James' bespoke concoctions have proved to be nothing but top shelf, the latest gongs among dozens of national and international accolades in its first two years.\nAdvertisement \"To win Australia\u2019s best distillery in our first year could be seen as beginners' luck,\" James said.\n\"By taking out the award again just shows that we\u2019re doing something right.\n\"My philosophy in starting Old Young's was to work smart, be local, embrace silly and get dirty.\"\nSo particular is James about the make-up of his spirits, he somehow persuaded growers in Italy to provide him with enough Tuscan junipers for his new Common Gin to be 100 per cent made from them.\nClearly the distillery's gamble with innovative spirits is paying off.\n\"Common Gin is a new, navy-strength (57.5 per cent), single botanical gin made solely from our Tuscan juniper,\" James said.\n\"We have quadruped the amount of juniper from our other gins \u2013 it\u2019s a gin for purists, awesome in a G&T and reflects the fascination people have with high quality, interesting spirits at the moment.\"\nJames purchased the mothballed former Wild Swan distillery in 2015 and launched Old Young's in May 2016.\nHe currently produces four very distinct vodkas and five flavour-filled gins, including the multi-award-winning Pavlova Vodka (which tastes as awesome as it sounds) and 1829 Gin.\nJames hopes the whirlwind success of the past two years translates into exposure and sales on the international scene.\nOn Saturday he flies to the US, where he hopes to defend Old Young's 2017 title for Best International Vodka at the American Distilling Institute Craft Spirit Awards.\nThere are also plans to expand operations in the Swan Valley.\nLicense this article What's on Comments disabled", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

His death is not regarded as suspicious and will be subject of a Coronial investigation,\" a police statement said. \n\"This ends a tragic sequence of events that will impact upon the Geraldton community. \n\"We want to thank the public for its support during this operation.\" Geraldton community shocked \nWA Police Regional Commander Jo McCabe said Mr Vlahov and his family were \"well-known to the Geraldton community\". \n\"This tragic incident has shocked the Geraldton community and our thoughts are with the deceased man's family at this time,\" Commander McCabe said. \nMr Chamberlain's family has issued a statement expressing the enormity of its loss. \n\"We are devastated by Philip's death,\" the statement said. \n\"Philip was a much loved husband and father, and was well known in the Geraldton community. \n\"We wish to thank the community for its support at this extremely difficult time.\" \nGeraldton Mayor Shane Van Styn said both men would be sorely missed. \n\"There are two families involved in this tragic set of circumstances and it will have a significant impact on our community,\" he said. \n\"But we are just that, we are a tight community.\" \nHe said Mr Chamberlain will be remembered as a gentleman. \n\"A kind, somewhat reserved fellow \u2026 who always wore a smile and was well known as much for his accounting abilities as he was for being a gentleman,\" he said. \nMr Vlahov and his two brothers and sister lost their father last year. \nAll three brothers are farmers in the Chapman Valley area, north-east of Geraldton. \nIt is understood a succession plan had not been established before the father passed away. \nMr Chamberlain is understood to have been the Vlahovs' family accountant. \nChapman Valley Primary School, which is near the Vlahov family farms, is offering specialised counselling services to families affected. Full investigation underway \nAssistant Commissioner Murray Smalpage would not reveal what sparked the shooting, but said Major Crime Squad detectives, the Homicide Squad and other specialists would conduct a full and comprehensive investigation into the incident. \n\"Mr Vlahov and the deceased were known to each other,\" he said. \n\"But the circumstances of their relationship and the causal factors of the shooting will be the subject of a full investigation.\" \nCommissioner Smalpage confirmed Mr Vlahov was at the business with others, but would not confirm if some of those attending the meeting were family members of Mr Vlahov. \n\"Full details of what happened in that property will be the subject of a coronial investigation, so I am not in a position to outline the full, blow-by-blow description of what happened in that room,\" he said. \n\"But the circumstances are pretty clear we have one man, unfortunately, deceased.\" \nCommissioner Smalpage there were other people inside the building at the time of the shooting and they were assisting police with the investigation. \nHe urged anyone with information about the shooting to contact police.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rodney vlahov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vlahov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian broadcasting corporation", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "douglas cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chamberlain chartered accountants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wa police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chapman valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flores road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:39:17.016+03:00"}], "totalResults": 301, "moreResultsAvailable": 291, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746625368&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AAU+location%3APerth&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 842, "extra": {"place": "Perth", "country": "AU", "lat": "-31.9505269", "lng": "115.8604572"}}
