He said [settlers] are building on their land. Son of a dog, they are building in their land?\" \nFriedman was made aware of Abbas' remarks just moments before delivering a speech of his own at the Sixth Global Forum for Combating Antisemitism in Jerusalem. \nThe American decided to bring up Abbas' insult, asking his audience, \"Antisemitism or political discourse? Not for me to judge, I will leave that up to you.\" \nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted that such rhetoric from the Palestinian leadership has become the norm ever since Trump took office and Washington stopped blindly accepting the Palestinian narrative. \n\"For the first time in decades, the American administration has stopped pampering the Palestinian leaders and says to them: \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\" said Netanyahu. \"Apparently, the shock from the truth is causing them to lose their tempers.\" \nWant more news from Israel?

The Prime Minister told\nhim that today Iran threatens not only the Middle East but the entire world\nand added that Iran had to be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. The\ntwo men discussed advancing bilateral cooperation in technology, innovation\nand trade.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu thanked Bulgarian President Radev for Holocaust\ncommemoration in Bulgaria and said that he appreciated the latter's position\nin the struggle against anti-Semitism.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu:\n\"Mr. President, you have always been a staunch ally of the Jewish state and\nthe Jewish people. You've spoken eloquently and powerfully against\nanti-Semitism and you are welcome as a true friend, as is Bulgaria. We have\na special relationship with Bulgaria \u2013 past, present and future.\nWe'll never forget that 75 years ago, the people of Bulgaria in Sofia stood\nup in an exemplary way against the Nazi demands for deportation: The\nclerics, the teachers, the intellectuals who came to the train station in\nSofia. And I was always impressed by the telegram of the German\nrepresentative to Berlin who said, explaining the failure of this\ndeportation. He said: \"The people of Bulgaria haven't developed enough.\" And\nin fact, it showed the moral heights that Bulgaria reached in those days.\nAnd we know that there were dark periods in those horrible years. But we\nalways remember what happened in Sofia as a testament of human morality and\nfriendship to our people.\nToday we have excellent relations and they are buttressed by Bulgarian Jews\nwho came here, who form an integral human bridge between us. And equally, we\nhave flourishing relations, which we work in many ways to cement and develop\nin this visit of yours in a variety of fields, all fields really.\nAnd that leads me to the future. You were yesterday in Beer-Sheva, you saw\nour cyber center. Israel is seizing the future, not only in matters of cyber\nsecurity but in all matters of technology that will change our lives. I'm\nstill under the impression of a breakfast I had on Sunday with a visionary,\nElon Musk, who speaks about changing the world. He speaks about reaching\nMars, speaks about plumbing the depths of the earth and the human mind, and\nthese are not fantasies \u2013 these are things that are happening. Israel is at\nthe forefront of all this scientific research and technological know-how.\nWe're eager to share it with our friends. You are our friends, we share with\nyou the past, a vibrant present and unbelievable future.\nWelcome to Jerusalem friend.\"\nBulgarian President Radev:\n\"Thank you for the warm words that you have said about Bulgarian people.\nI want to congratulate you with the 70th birthday of Israel, which is now\nnothing but an example for a modern state with functional institutions,\nvibrant democracy and vibrant civil society. We are together in\ncommemorating the 75th anniversary on an unprecedented act of the rescue of\nBulgarian Jewish population, which is nothing but a solid foundation to\nbuild upon our ties. This historically connected ties between our two\npeoples \u2013 this is nothing but a priceless capital, which we should care and\ndevelop.\nBut today what we need is more pragmatism in our bilateral relations. I'm\nsure that you agree with me that what we have as a trade exchange in amount\nof 150 million dollars does not correspond either with our good political\nties or either with the atmosphere between the two countries.\nWe are deeply interested to take the Israeli example to build a society that\nis both socially engaged and integrated. I mean basically the hi-tech, I\nmean the cyber security, and science and education.\nThank you very much that you opened before our delegation the gates of the\nGav Yam technological park to look at the future. We saw with our own eyes\non the spot the tremendous advantage of Israel in this area. It came to my\nmind that you are the founding father of this initiative and I congratulate\nyou.\nWe are also quite interested in diversification of resources. And another\ngood opportunity is to both import and pass natural gas through Bulgaria.\nWe have good cooperation in the field of fight against terror. I would like\nto stress the important support we received from you after the terror act in\nSarafovo in 2012. The tense situation in this world requires the security\ncommunities to cooperate with each other. And also our well-established ties\nin the sphere of defense.\nMy visit to Israel is also connected with participation in the 6th Global\nForum to Combat Anti-Semitism, and this is in a world that the voice of\nhatred and xenophobia is rising up. I would like to confirm the firm\nposition of Bulgaria of zero tolerance toward revisionism of history, and\nhatred and anti-Semitism.\nPrime Minister, as I said, we have a lot of pragmatic issues ahead of us,\nand I will be very glad if we discuss them and seek steps forward for us.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rumen radev", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T23:24:23.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e1ca349e7764e29d17bed03a7dedec168cf58c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lRYtVMq_QpDUs.FnF6MLVIa4duGbbMzyjwhBQB0biETXRffj6RAc2_ZOoqp9gFyY-", "site_full": "www.israelnationalnews.com", "site": "israelnationalnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "judaism", "religion"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "title_full": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "published": "2018-03-25T18:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.058, "main_image": "http://k6s3v6r4.ssl.hwcdn.net/pictures/794/794766.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18367, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e1ca349e7764e29d17bed03a7dedec168cf58c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lRYtVMq_QpDUs.FnF6MLVIa4duGbbMzyjwhBQB0biETXRffj6RAc2_ZOoqp9gFyY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T18:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "text": "  Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat won't seek reelection Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat won't seek reelection \nNir Barkat says he will run for Knesset seat with Likud rather than seek third term as mayor of Israel's capital.
