(Jason Franson/Canadian Press )\n\nInstead of a five-year plan to balance the books, the minister presented a three-year plan to a $7-billion deficit in 2020/21.\n\nThey missed a big opportunity to reduce uncertainty, build trust and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 show their prior commitments were genuine.\nMORE BUDGET NEWS |  Alberta premier calls B.C. complaints about high gas prices environmental hypocrisy \n\nBut they took a pass, and there's no good reason why.\n\nA high-level sketch \nThe budget did contain hints of a potential path to a balanced budget.\n\nIt described the total revenues, royalties and spending that the NDP government needs to balance by 2023.\nBut this does not constitute a plan. It lacks any credible detail. It's an aspiration (barely).\n\nIt's one thing to know where we have to go, but it's quite another to map out how to get there. Without that detail, fiscal uncertainty remains.\n\nThe government projects spending levels of $65.5 billion by 2023/24. But in what ministries or on which programs is not known.\n\nHow much for health, how much for education, how much for community services, and so on? And what of the compassionate cuts the government repeatedly referenced? Your guess is as good as mine.\nANALYSIS |  Glory days ahead vs. impending doom: The political rhetoric over Alberta's financial future \nThe same is true on the revenue side. The government needs $66.3 billion in 2023/24 to balance. Of that, $10.4 billion will be from resource royalties. But how much from income taxes, carbon taxes, gas taxes, federal transfers or user fees? We don't know.\n\nThis lack of detail is unusual.\n\nFormer Premier Jim Prentice released a detailed 5-year plan in Budget 2015. He even included a 10-year plan with more information that what we see in Budget 2018.\n\nAnd it's not just former government budgets that provided more details than what we got this time around \u2014 opposition parties have, too.\n\nBetter shadow budgets \nThe opposition shadow budgets from the Alberta Party and from Independent MLA Derek Fildebrandt both contained more information than the government's own numbers.\n\nWith an army of skilled and professional public servants, with a wealth of data and modelling at their disposal, I expected more. Much more.\n\nThere's no reason why they couldn't have presented a plan to balance. In fact, they appear to be on such a path already.\n\nFrom 2016-17 to 2020-21, program spending will grow an average of 2.1 per cent a year. That's less than population growth plus inflation \u2014 a useful benchmark for spending. And if it continues forward to 2023-24, it may be sufficient to balance the budget by then \u2014 if royalties grow to $10 billion or so.\nOPINION |  Why young men are being left out of Alberta's economic recovery ANALYSIS |  Alberta's debt is growing, so how much is too much for Albertans? \nMy own estimates \u2014 based on entirely independent, cruder methods \u2014 suggests this is enough. But why leave such analysis to people outside government? We don't have all the information, or the time, to put forward a credible plan \u2014 and no mandate to make tough choices.\n\nThe government has all this. So why not put some meat on the bones?\n\nMaking bold statements about future policy with little to no detail is what opposition parties do, not governments. Lofty rhetoric doesn't substitute for a credible plan.\n\nThis matters. A lot. Because what global credit agencies are looking for, this budget doesn't offer.\n\nA ratings downgrade? \nFor starters, Albertans have now seen five deficit budgets in a row.\n\nLow oil prices made this unavoidable. But with economic recovery underway, we must turn to balancing the books without relying on royalties. If not now, when?\n\nCredit rating agencies are also a factor.\n\nAlberta has seen many downgrades in recent years, but not because we're drowning in debt as some suggest. Alberta has the strongest balance sheet in the country, now and for the foreseeable future. From such a position of strength, Alberta's government can make far more careful, nuanced, and longer-term fiscal decisions. But they aren't.\nInstead, rating agencies worry about the risk of Alberta voluntarily exposing itself to volatile oil prices. By continuing to require substantial resource royalties to balance, this budget fails to address the core concern of investors.\n\n\"It appears to us that the government is partly looking to a recovery in oil prices to improve its fiscal position,\" wrote S&P in its report last year. And DBRS (another ratings agency) is concerned \"that the plan to return to balance relies on a recovery in resource revenues, rather than fundamental adjustments to the budget\u2026 [and] there is no clarity as to when the credit profile will stabilize.\"\n\nBudget 2018 fell short. It may even risk another downgrade. Yet again, the government kicked the fiscal can down the road.\n\nAnd it's only getting heavier.\n\nLooking to get lucky \nWe're as reliant on royalties as ever. Despite government claims to the contrary.\n\nIn Budget 2018, we need $12.6 billion in resource revenues to balance \u2014 an amount Alberta has only seen once before (in 2005/06). To shrink our reliance, we need to shrink the deficit without relying on royalties. And we aren't.\n\nBetween now and 2023-24, royalty growth delivers three-quarters of what the government is counting on to balance.\n\nHere's another way to think about it. Below I plot the fraction of government revenue we need to come from royalties to balance. If fewer royalties come in, we run a deficit. If we're lucky enough to have more, then we run a surplus.\nWe need roughly one in five dollars of government revenue to come from royalties in order to balance \u2014 and this will only modestly decline in the coming years.\n\nThe problem with Budget 2018 was not so much in what it contained, but in what it didn't.\n\nWorse, there was a complete divergence between public statements made by the premier and the minister of finance and what Budget 2018 ultimately revealed.\n\nIf the government wanted to provide a plan, they could have. They chose not to.\n\nMaybe there's a good reason. Perhaps they couldn't agree. Perhaps they're worried about making the tough choices. Regardless of the reason, the bait-and-switch the government pulled risks lowering its fiscal credibility further \u2014 at precisely the wrong time.\n\nWith fiscal challenges as large as Alberta's, a full and frank public debate is needed. With Budget 2018 as the last full budget cycle before the next election, this was their opportunity.\n\nThey blew it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trevor tombe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rachel notley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe ceci", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T18:07:02.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "893fb125d021617ff2a02374f0a464ce1340d982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzXDa65f.ztMmog2M81G3OGS2Xd6eiHFqC9dMpYjy1IuuJCpXqqd7NqkXdOASvHUP7HDoocU_pIico6KnYoTIJZ.PLUyBCD3n.E", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-calgary.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "'They blew it.'

(Jason Franson/Canadian Press ) \nInstead of a five-year plan to balance the books, the minister presented a three-year plan to a $7-billion deficit in 2020/21. \nThey missed a big opportunity to reduce uncertainty, build trust and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 show their prior commitments were genuine. \nBut they took a pass, and there's no good reason why. A high-level sketch \nThe budget did contain hints of a potential path to a balanced budget. \nIt described the total revenues, royalties and spending that the NDP government needs to balance by 2023. \nBut this does not constitute a plan. It lacks any credible detail. It's an aspiration (barely). \nIt's one thing to know where we have to go, but it's quite another to map out how to get there. Without that detail, fiscal uncertainty remains. \nThe government projects spending levels of $65.5 billion by 2023/24. But in what ministries or on which programs is not known. \nHow much for health, how much for education, how much for community services, and so on? And what of the compassionate cuts the government repeatedly referenced? Your guess is as good as mine. ANALYSIS | Glory days ahead vs. impending doom: The political rhetoric over Alberta's financial future \nThe same is true on the revenue side. The government needs $66.3 billion in 2023/24 to balance. Of that, $10.4 billion will be from resource royalties. But how much from income taxes, carbon taxes, gas taxes, federal transfers or user fees? We don't know. \nThis lack of detail is unusual. \nFormer Premier Jim Prentice released a detailed 5-year plan in Budget 2015. He even included a 10-year plan with more information that what we see in Budget 2018. \nAnd it's not just former government budgets that provided more details than what we got this time around \u2014 opposition parties have, too. Better shadow budgets \nThe opposition shadow budgets from the Alberta Party and from Independent MLA Derek Fildebrandt both contained more information than the government's own numbers. \nWith an army of skilled and professional public servants, with a wealth of data and modelling at their disposal, I expected more. Much more. \nThere's no reason why they couldn't have presented a plan to balance. In fact, they appear to be on such a path already. \nFrom 2016-17 to 2020-21, program spending will grow an average of 2.1 per cent a year. That's less than population growth plus inflation \u2014 a useful benchmark for spending. And if it continues forward to 2023-24, it may be sufficient to balance the budget by then \u2014 if royalties grow to $10 billion or so. ANALYSIS | Alberta's debt is growing, so how much is too much for Albertans? \nMy own estimates \u2014 based on entirely independent, cruder methods \u2014 suggests this is enough. But why leave such analysis to people outside government? We don't have all the information, or the time, to put forward a credible plan \u2014 and no mandate to make tough choices. \nThe government has all this. So why not put some meat on the bones? \nMaking bold statements about future policy with little to no detail is what opposition parties do, not governments. Lofty rhetoric doesn't substitute for a credible plan. \nThis matters. A lot. Because what global credit agencies are looking for, this budget doesn't offer. A ratings downgrade? \nFor starters, Albertans have now seen five deficit budgets in a row. \nLow oil prices made this unavoidable. But with economic recovery underway, we must turn to balancing the books without relying on royalties. If not now, when? \nCredit rating agencies are also a factor. \nAlberta has seen many downgrades in recent years, but not because we're drowning in debt as some suggest. Alberta has the strongest balance sheet in the country, now and for the foreseeable future. From such a position of strength, Alberta's government can make far more careful, nuanced, and longer-term fiscal decisions. But they aren't. \nInstead, rating agencies worry about the risk of Alberta voluntarily exposing itself to volatile oil prices. By continuing to require substantial resource royalties to balance, this budget fails to address the core concern of investors. \n\"It appears to us that the government is partly looking to a recovery in oil prices to improve its fiscal position,\" wrote S&P in its report last year. And DBRS (another ratings agency) is concerned \"that the plan to return to balance relies on a recovery in resource revenues, rather than fundamental adjustments to the budget\u2026 [and] there is no clarity as to when the credit profile will stabilize.\" \nBudget 2018 fell short. It may even risk another downgrade. Yet again, the government kicked the fiscal can down the road. \nAnd it's only getting heavier. Looking to get lucky \nWe're as reliant on royalties as ever. Despite government claims to the contrary. \nIn Budget 2018, we need $12.6 billion in resource revenues to balance \u2014 an amount Alberta has only seen once before (in 2005/06). To shrink our reliance, we need to shrink the deficit without relying on royalties. And we aren't. \nBetween now and 2023-24, royalty growth delivers three-quarters of what the government is counting on to balance. \nHere's another way to think about it. Below I plot the fraction of government revenue we need to come from royalties to balance. If fewer royalties come in, we run a deficit. If we're lucky enough to have more, then we run a surplus. \nWe need roughly one in five dollars of government revenue to come from royalties in order to balance \u2014 and this will only modestly decline in the coming years. \nThe problem with Budget 2018 was not so much in what it contained, but in what it didn't. \nWorse, there was a complete divergence between public statements made by the premier and the minister of finance and what Budget 2018 ultimately revealed. \nIf the government wanted to provide a plan, they could have. They chose not to. \nMaybe there's a good reason. Perhaps they couldn't agree. Perhaps they're worried about making the tough choices. Regardless of the reason, the bait-and-switch the government pulled risks lowering its fiscal credibility further \u2014 at precisely the wrong time. \nWith fiscal challenges as large as Alberta's, a full and frank public debate is needed. With Budget 2018 as the last full budget cycle before the next election, this was their opportunity. \nThey blew it. \nCalgary: The Road Ahead is CBC Calgary's special focus on our city as we build the city we want \u2014 the city we need.
