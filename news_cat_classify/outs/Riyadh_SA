The ratings, carrying a \u2018Stable\u2019 outlook, was given based on Maalem\u2019s \u201cvery sound\u201d capital base together with its low leverage, ample liquidity that comfortably covers short-term debt, and improved asset quality.\nMaalem stated that Capital Intelligence also attributed the rating to the growth potential of the financing market in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular financing for small- and medium-sized entities (SMEs), which represents a key target segment for Maalem Financing.\nLicensed by the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority (SAMA) in 2016, Maalem Financing is a non-banking finance company (NBFC) operating on Shariah basis in Saudi Arabia. It has reported brisk growth in its financing portfolio, consisting entirely of Murabaha receivables in the first quarters of 2017.\n\u201cMaalem Financing has achieved a major milestone, having received its first-time corporate ratings carrying a stable outlook. The ratings reflect Maalem\u2019s status as one of the fastest growing Shariah-based financial institutions in Saudi Arabia with good governance and sound financial management. Maalem aims to consolidate its position in the market by focusing on the strengths of its operations and executive team, built on international best practices as well as its experiences gained from the local market,\u201d said Aymen Sejiny, chairman of MFC.\nWhile assigning the corporate ratings, Capital Intelligence has highlighted the opportunity before Maalem to capitalize on the growth potential of the local financing market, especially in the SME sector, which has a significant gap in lending demand and supply.\nThe rating agency has noted Maalem\u2019s improved asset quality metrics by the end of the third quarter as non-performing financing receivables (NPFRs) declined in absolute terms, driven by higher collections. It has also observed that the ratio of NPFRs to total financing has improved to a level that is considered satisfactory for an NBFC.\nCapital Intelligence has also taken into account the fact that the loss coverage of Maalem\u2019s NPFRs has increased significantly from a very low point in 2016. Besides, its leverage is one of the lowest recorded among Capital Intelligence\u2019s rated NBFCs.\nMaalem Financing\u2019s capital base strengthened considerably after it issued SR50 million in share capital in 2017. This has acted as a mitigating factor for the modest loss reserve of NPFRs by enhancing the effective coverage ratio, while also providing ample scope for further credit growth.\nCapital Intelligence has observed that Maalem\u2019s low leverage means that it is unlikely to encounter vulnerabilities to liquidity pressures as the financial institution had been prudent in matching its rapid lending growth in the first three quarters of 2017 with pre-arranged new funding.\nMaalem\u2019s coverage of short-term liabilities by liquid assets, including cash and short-term financing receivables, was robust at end of the third quarter of 2017. This reflected the long-term maturity of its single debt facility and the short-term nature of the bulk of its financing, together with the enhanced liquidity buffer provided by higher bank balances.\nStarting its operations in 2009, Maalem obtained a license from SAMA in 2016 for delivering finance to individuals and SMEs. Maalem has recorded strong earnings in recent years, enjoying solid financing income generation thanks to good margins on its financing receivables portfolio. As at the end of September 2017, the company reported consolidated assets of SR231 million ($62 million). \u2014 SG", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maalem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maalem financing company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "capital intelligence ratings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capital intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia monetary authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murabaha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T20:23:14.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fedc384799c4831a0410afad207692dca7079107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO6x4Do9vn14YkXfdv9aykS072teA.ARyD86MWsl6xpAgdhFbDzHip64K8ezo867.qSHtXGrCU.1Qu2lWppTbw_moQLdWdJlAkn25swjLOnGSV_M7nlgx7kC", "site_full": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site_section": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Saudi Gazette/ Home Page", "title": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story", "title_full": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story - Saudi Gazette", "published": "2018-03-24T00:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2018/03/24/772155.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29738, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fedc384799c4831a0410afad207692dca7079107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO6x4Do9vn14YkXfdv9aykS072teA.ARyD86MWsl6xpAgdhFbDzHip64K8ezo867.qSHtXGrCU.1Qu2lWppTbw_moQLdWdJlAkn25swjLOnGSV_M7nlgx7kC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mariam Nihal", "published": "2018-03-24T00:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story", "text": "Mariam Nihal\nSaudi Gazette\nDirected by Matteo Lonardi, Reframe Saudi is a Virtual Reality documentary that uses cultural narratives to explore Saudi Arabia. It gives the world a chance to delve deeper into the cultural dynamics of the Kingdom through local artists who are shaping the future and starting conversations with the world by sharing their experiences and perspectives. It features Ahmad Angawi, Dana Awartani, Rashed Al-Shashai, Ajlan Gharem, Zahra Al-Ghamdi, Ayman Yossri Daydban, Jameela Mater, Ahaad Alamoudi and Ali Mogawi working within the confines of their studios between Jeddah, Abha and Riyadh. The movie is shot around the Kingdom showcasing the stunning landscape and never-seen-before footage of rural and present-day spaces in a manner that transports one to Saudi Arabia via a VR headset. \u201cReframe Saudi is a VR documentary about the art scene in Saudi Arabia, showcasing nine artists and how they reflect in their environment,\u201d Lonardi told Saudi Gazette. \u201cI always talk about contemporary issues in society through artists specifically through VR. I have done something similar for Tehran. I worked with many artists especially Ahmed Mater who watched Reframe Tehran. I pitched the idea to him and Stephen Stapleton, and they really wanted to do it. It took us two years to do it,\u201d he added. Visitors at Art Dubai experienced a preview of the film, with a VR headset and headphones. \u201cIt was a wonderful experience, I felt like I was with the artists and I could move around the landscape by just turning around as if I was there. The whole experience was mind-blowing and I can\u2019t wait to watch the film,\u201d Mona Ali, a visitor at Art Dubai told Saudi Gazette. The preview was followed by a panel discussion on VR and Contemporary Art, moderated by Marisa Mazria Katz with World VR Forum Director, Salar Sahna, VR film maker Matteo Lonardi and Saudi Artist Ahaad Alamoudi. \u201cIt took 12 days to shoot the entire footage. We are looking to launch the film in June this year,\u201d Lonardi told Saudi Gazette. The documentary was launched at Art Dubai following the partnership between the fair and Misk Art Institute headed by Ahmed Mater.

Mark was at that time on a holiday in Saudi Arabia to visit some famous cities like Riyadh, Abha, and Jeddah for 10 days.\nMark is a well-known millionaire and also a practiced lawyer in Los Angeles, specializing in cases of civil laws. The last big case he handled was the case of the famous American pop singer, Michael Jackson, a week before he passed away.\nA tourist guide who accompanied Mark for 10 days in Saudi Arabia, Dhawi Ben Nashir said, \u201cSince he set foot for the first time in Saudi Arabia, Mark already started to ask questions about Islam and the prayer. As soon as he arrived in Saudi Arabia, Mark stayed in Riyadh for two days. While in Riyadh, Mark was very interested in Islam. After moving to Najran, we went to Abha and Al-Ula. There, his fascination for Islam grew more obvious, especially the time when we ventured out into the desert.\u201d\n\u201cMark was amazed to see three Saudi youths who were in our group in Al-Ula, performing the prayer in the expanse of the very wide desert; a very fantastic panorama indeed.\u201d\n\u201cAfter two days in Al-Ula, we went to Al-Juf. As soon as we arrived in Al-Juf, Mark asked if I could get him some books on Islam. I then obtained some books on Islam for him. Mark read all those books. The next morning, he asked me to teach him how to perform the prayer. I then taught him how to pray and make wudhu (ablution). Then, he joined me and performed the prayer beside me.\u201d\n\u201cAfter prayer, Mark told me that he felt peace in his soul. On Thursday afternoon, we left Al-Ula heading for Jeddah. He looked very serious throughout the journey reading those books about Islam. On Friday morning, we visited the old town of Jeddah. Before the time for the Friday prayer approached, we went back to the hotel and I excused myself to go for the Friday prayer.\u201d\nMark said to his companion, \u201cI would like to join you for the Friday prayer so that I can witness myself how the Friday prayer is like.\u201d\nHis friend, Dhawi Ben Nashir, welcomed the idea.\nDhawi Ben Nashir said, \u201cWe then went to a masjid which was not far from the hotel where we stayed in Jeddah. Since we were quite late, I and many others had to pray outside, as the number of worshippers was overflowing. I could see Mark observing the people in congregation, especially after the Friday prayer was completed, when everybody was shaking hands and embracing each other with radiant and happy faces. Mark was very impressed with what he saw.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we returned to the hotel, Mark suddenly told me that he wanted to become a Muslim. So I said to him, \u2018Please take a shower first.\u2019 After Mark took the shower, I guided him in saying the shahadah (declaration of faith) and then he prayed two rakaah. Later on, Mark expressed his desire to visit the Grand Mosque in Makkah and perform prayers there before leaving Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his wish, we went to the Da\u2019wah Center in Jeddah to obtain a formal proof of his conversion to Islam, so that he would be allowed to enter the city of Makkah and the Grand Mosque. Mark was given a temporary certificate of his conversion to Islam, and he visited the holy city of Makkah.\u201d\nAfter Mark declared his Islamic faith, he had the chance to express his experience to Al-Riyadh Newspaper, saying, \u201cI could not express my feelings at this time but I am being reborn and my life has just started. I am very happy. This happiness that I am feeling could not be expressed in words, especially when I visited the Grand Mosque and noble Ka\u2019bah.\u201d\nRegarding his next step after his conversion to Islam, Mark explained that he wants to learn more about Islam, delve deeper into the religion of Allah (Islam), and come back to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj.\nAs to what impelled him into converting to Islam, Mark explained, \u201cI already had information about Islam, but it was very limited. When I visited Saudi Arabia and personally witnessed the Muslims there, and saw how they performed the prayer, I felt a very strong drive to know more about Islam.
