And, as backup, the threats of savvy realists.\nThey chanted about the guns they want to ban and the lobby group they want to defeat and the politicians they would, ideally, like to persuade. Knowing they might not succeed, not right now, what they chanted most frequently was a promise to punish the officials who refuse to listen.\n\u201cVote them out!\u201d they cried, over and over, on a dozen jam-packed blocks of Pennsylvania Ave., the street that connects Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s White House with the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress. \u201cVote them out!\u201d\nRead more:\nIn photos: Across the U.S., Canada and Europe, students are leading the charge for gun control\nArticle Continued Below U.S. Congress tiptoes toward narrow gun legislation ahead of \u2018March For Our Lives\u2019 rally\nMarch for our lives gun control supporters rally in Toronto\nThe extraordinary turnout at Washington\u2019s March for Our Lives and at sister rallies across the country offered a vivid demonstration of a new student-fuelled momentum for the tightening of U.S. gun laws .\nThe main event was too successful to be an actual moving march. Instead, well over 500,000 people stood shoulder to shoulder, boyish middle-schoolers beside weathered activists awed by them, and listened to the fiery new leaders of the gun control movement, none of whom has turned 20.\nFamous entertainers performed but did not give extended speeches. The headliners here were the organizers: survivors of the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, whose sights were squarely set on the 2018 and 2020 elections.\n\u201cWe will get rid of these public servants that only serve the gun lobby,\u201d said David Hogg. \u201cAnd we will save lives.\u201d\n\u201cPoliticians: either represent the people or get out,\u201d said Cameron Kasky. \u201cThe people demand a law banning the sale of assault weapons. The people demand we prohibit the sale of high-capacity magazines. The people demand universal background checks. Stand for us or beware. The voters are coming.\u201d\nThe push for change that started with the massacre of 17 people at Douglas in February has already achieved a smattering of legislative success at the state level, and it appeared to prod Trump into action to pursue a regulatory ban on bump stocks. But it seems highly unlikely that there will be any real legislative action at the federal level while Republicans are in control.\nHave your say Political analysts, and many Republicans, believe a Democratic wave is possible in the 2018 congressional mid-terms. Young people tend to vote at by far the lowest rates. But the young people at the march said their peers are unusually motivated at the moment, furious both at Trump in general and specifically at Republican inaction on guns.\n\u201cRight now there are definitely some obstacles, but if this generation\u2019s voting turns out anything like this protest did, then I have a pretty good feeling,\u201d said Zoe Afful, 23, a university student from Maryland who was persuaded to attend by her 18-year-old sister, Bethel Afful.\nThe Douglas students shared the stage with students who have experienced gun violence of lower-profile kinds. Edna Chavez , a 17-year-old from South Los Angeles, spoke of the murder of her brother in the \u201cnormal\u201d daily fashion experienced by Black and Hispanic young people, \u201cnormal to the point that I learned to duck from bullets before I learned how to read.\u201d Mya Middleton, a 16-year-old from Chicago, spoke of a thief in a store holding a gun to her face and threatening to find her if she ever said something.\n\u201cAnd yet I\u2019m still saying something today,\u201d she said.\nEmma Gonzalez, a survivor of the massacre Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was one of the speakers in Washingtond, D.C. Tears rolled down her face she observed 6 minutes and 20 seconds of silence in honour of her fallen classmates. ( Chip Somodevilla ) An urban youth group in Boston brought 150 children to the march. Perhaps three quarters of them had personal experience with gun violence, said Sydnee Young-Brown, 26, one of their march guardians.\n\u201cThis kind of stuff happens in the inner city all the time. I think we\u2019re coming not only to stand in solidarity with people that have lost their lives in schools but also that have lost their lives on our streets,\u201d she said.\nThe crowd skewed young, but older people marched too, some of them roped into attending by children and grandchildren. Mary Reinman, a 61-year-old from Charlottesville, Va. who was an anti-war protester in her youth, held a sign with a slogan borrowed from a tweet by Douglas activist Sarah Chadwick.\n\u201cI am so inspired by these kids. They\u2019re fearless. They\u2019re articulate. They\u2019re bright. I\u2019m just astounded,\u201d Reinman said.\nAlmost all Republican members of Congress were silent on the marches. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio commended the protesters but said \u201cmany other Americans\u201d see \u201cbanning guns as an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies.\u201d\nDemocratic former president Barack Obama offered encouragement.\n\u201cMichelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today\u2019s marches happen. Keep at it. You\u2019re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change,\u201d he said on Twitter.\nStudents in the crowd carried comedic memes denouncing the National Rifle Association, the country\u2019s chief gun-rghts lobby group, and mocking Trump, who did not immediately comment from his weekend retreat in Florida. But they also carried signs expressing despondence, frustration and fear.\n\u201cWe are the future, and we are scared,\u201d read Corina Tipton\u2019s.\nRead more:\nFlorida high school where gunman killed 17 will require students to carry clear backpacks\nPublic support for tougher gun control laws soars in U.S., poll shows\nStudents from low-crime small towns and high-crime big cities alike said they had long been frightened at school. Tipton, 16, of a rural and suburban Maryland county, said her classmates have been spending spare moments in class \u201ctrying to come up with all of the best ways to hide if there were an active shooter.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone will look toward the stack of textbooks in the corner and will be like, \u2018Hey do you think you can remove the ceiling tiles and climb up there if there\u2019s an active shooter?\u201d she said.\nOther students had already suffered at the hands of shooters. Zion Foster, 16, took a bus 12 hours from Ohio to march with a sign vowing that his 2020 vote would be taken from his \u201ccold, dead hand,\u201d a reference to an NRA slogan.\nHis friend JoJo Holloway, 17, was shot dead in her apartment in October.\n\u201cI just want to do what I can for her,\u201d Foster said.\nThe most emotional moment of the day was provided by Emma Gonzalez, the Douglas student who has become the most prominent of the accidental activists.\nGonzalez named the murdered classmates who would no longer get to do what they had always done: \u201cHelena Ramsay would never hang around after school with Max, Gina Montalto would never wave to her friend Liam at lunch \u2026 Peter Wang would never, Alyssa Alhadeff would never, Jamie Guttenberg would never, Meadow Pollack would never \u2026 .\u201d\nThen she abruptly stopped talking.\nShe stared straight ahead, occasionally closing her teary eyes, until an alarm beeped to tell her she had been on stage for six minutes and twenty seconds, the length of the massacre.\n\u201cFight for your life before it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s job,\u201d Gonzalez concluded.\nThousands of people sobbed.\nThen, a minute or so later, students watching on one of the screens on Pennsylvania Ave. started chanting again: \u201cVote them out!\u201d\nDelivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Before, it was nothing,\u201d she said.\nVuong, who lives upstairs from her restaurant, is completely surrounded by The Drake.\nThe hotel bought three properties immediately east of its flagship hotel in 2004, which is where the planned expansion will go.\nAdjacent, to the east of Saigon Flower, is another parcel, purchased a year later. But, says John Granger, director of development, there are no plans to develop it yet. The space was formerly the site of The Drake Commissary, which moved to Sterling Rd. last year, and now boasts a restaurant, larder, bar and bakery.\n\u201cYears ago, we did approach Vuong to see if she would be interested in selling,\u201d Granger said. \u201cShe\u2019s very adamant; she\u2019s committed to being part of the neighbourhood.\u201d\nThe hotel\u2019s expansion will begin next month and be completed, Granger projects, by spring 2020.\nThe development will include 32 new hotel rooms, which will bring the room count to 51, and the lobby will be revamped.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really extend the existing streetscape,\u201d he said. \u201cContinuing the fa\u00e7ade, balancing with what exists there already and extending the hotel lobby experience through there.\u201d\nVuong came to Canada from what was then known as Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) as a refugee. She opened the restaurant in 1986 with her late husband, Thai Khac Chuong, a noted photojournalist.\nFour full-scale black-and-white photographs taken in Vietnam adorn the walls. One is the winner of a World Press Photo award for spot news in 1976. The picture shows a man being pushed away from bordering an evacuation plane in what was then South Vietnam.\nVuong said she doesn\u2019t know how to feel about The Drake\u2019s expansion until it\u2019s completed, but she does have concerns; it will be five storeys, which would block her windows, she said. She\u2019s also worried about snow and rain runoff.\n\u201cI have a view. I have the sun. I open the window and let the fresh air in,\u201d she said.\nGranger said that Vuong is being kept informed of all construction-related details, a process that\u2019s been going on for years.\n\u201cThose windows are part of the discussions now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a half a dozen things we\u2019re working on with her right now. We\u2019ve had tremendous success here. This is what\u2019s driving the entire expansion. I think having the local businesses beside us is a key part of it. It really is a community experience when people come out to stay at The Drake. It\u2019s all part of the fabric here.\n\u201c(Rose has) been our neighbourhood since, for, well, prior to The Drake,\u201d Granger continued. \u201cHappy she\u2019s there.\u201d\nOn the business side of things, Vuong said that, while it\u2019s hard to say how Saigon Flower could be affected, she said she hopes more young people means more business for her.\n\u201cYou build first, I\u2019ll build later,\u201d she said, laughing, referring to the expansion.\nDelivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The Prime Minister's Office wouldn't provide further details on Friday.\nIn 1864, five Tsilhqot'in chiefs were called to what they thought were peace talks to end the Chilcotin War .\nInstead, they were accused of massacring 14 members of a road-building party and were then tried, convicted and hanged.\nA plaque recognizing five wrongfully hanged Tsilhqot'in Chiefs is pictured near the Fraser River in Quesnel, B.C. The provincial government exonerated the chiefs in 2014. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press)\n'No form of guilt' Five of the chiefs were executed, under Crown authority, near the settlement of Quesnel, B.C., in the province's interior. A sixth chief was later hanged near New Westminster, B.C., after trying to offer reparations.\nThe chiefs opposed the construction of roads to gold-rich lands, and sought to stop the incursion into their traditional territory.\nThere are also allegations that the road-building crew took some Tsilhqot'in women hostage.\nDuncan McCue on game-changing B.C. title ruling The prime minister is expected to \"let everything go, meaning there's no form of guilt on behalf of the Tsilhqot'in in any way, shape or form,\" said Chief Joe Alphonse.\n\"The first order of business is to exonerate our war chiefs and then we'll get to work to bring back our lands as they were before contact [by European settlers]. It's time for Canada to step up to the plate,\" he said.\nThe Tsilhqot'in have long objected to the chiefs being tried as criminals, saying the killing of the colonists was carried out during a war between the First Nations and the colonial authority in B.C.\nB.C. First Nation signs agreement with province over land, resource talks In 2014, B.C. Premier Christy Clark also fully exonerated the chiefs of any wrongdoing.\nThe B.C. exoneration came after a landmark decision from the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled the Tsilhqot'in peoples had aboriginal title to a large swath of their traditional territory \u2014 over 1,700 square kilometres \u2014 not just old village sites as the provincial and federal governments had argued.\nIt was the first time in Canada aboriginal title had been confirmed, outside of an Indian reserve.\nWith files from CBC's Duncan McCue", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tsilhqot", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john paul tasker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tasker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b.c. first nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T03:54:41.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5a92d25c8fb5ab2325c613c283f0fa20f093649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq7QH.jfae5uxBiGk7WEEGuru.4r_LgNrV_geyhqb.jmQAxlcitO8YkE_2S6748dotVi5tyBTSULtoQbzIE3sXP52y487MIxaSc2hP37IjHMODZd955Z0Tm_b0SgC0JQcLfQrNpayw1gM", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "https://www.thestar.com/feeds.articlestopstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "Kathleen Wynne announces $2.4B for Sick Kids\u2019 patient care centre", "title_full": "Kathleen Wynne announces $2.4B for Sick Kids\u2019 patient care centre", "published": "2018-03-23T17:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/queenspark/2018/03/23/kathleen-wynne-announces-24b-for-sick-kids-patient-care-centre/wynne_march21.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3026, "comments": 0, "shares": 3026}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5a92d25c8fb5ab2325c613c283f0fa20f093649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq7QH.jfae5uxBiGk7WEEGuru.4r_LgNrV_geyhqb.jmQAxlcitO8YkE_2S6748dotVi5tyBTSULtoQbzIE3sXP52y487MIxaSc2hP37IjHMODZd955Z0Tm_b0SgC0JQcLfQrNpayw1gM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Benzie - Queen's Park Bureau Chief", "published": "2018-03-23T17:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kathleen Wynne announces $2.4B for Sick Kids\u2019 patient care centre", "text": "SickKids is getting a $2.4-billion booster shot from Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2019s Liberals.\nWynne announced Friday that the Hospital for Sick Children will receive the new capital funding in next week\u2019s provincial budget.\nThe money will go toward the design and construction of a new patient care centre that will add to the downtown Toronto hospital\u2019s capacity.\n\u201cAs any parent knows, when a child is sick nothing else matters,\u201d said Wynne, a mother of three adult children and grandmother of three.\n\u201cThe incredible physicians, nurses and staff members at Sick Kids understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this historic investment in Sick Kids is all about and it\u2019s why we\u2019re building new and improved hospitals around the province.\u201d\n Wynne\u2019s announcement, the day after she said hospitals\u2019 operating funding will jump by 4.6 per cent, or $822 million, next year, comes against the backdrop of a June 7 election.\nIt\u2019s part of $19 billion in hospital capital expenditures across the province over the next decade.\nOntario Premier Kathleen Wynne says her government will increase hospital funding by $822 million in 2018-2019, the third major funding promise the Liberals have made in as many days ahead of the province\u2019s June election.

My colleagues are innocent, my son, all these kids are innocent.\"\nBodil Geyer, who organized the march in Vancouver, said hundreds of people showed up despite a fake Facebook event showing the wrong time.\n\"We had a great turnout, all things considered,\" she said.\nGeyer said the real event page was also peppered with pro-gun comments she believed were generated by bots or international users, because the grammar was often incorrect and some messages were threatening.\nWhile the march was largely a show of support for the American gun control movement, Geyer said gang violence in Surrey also makes it a local issue.\nAll of the speakers at the Vancouver event were students, said Geyer, who represents both Democrats Abroad Vancouver and March On Vancouver.\n\"The crowd was amazing, they were awe-inspired, everyone was quite emotional listening to these kids,\" she said.\nTens of thousands of people were expected to attend the march in Washington, D.C., with smaller gatherings to take place in hundreds of cities across the world.\nRallies were also planned in most major Canadian cities, including St. John's, Ottawa and Calgary.\nMelissa Hennig, a survivor of the Oct. 1 mass shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, joined about 150 people for a rally outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton.\n\"While I don't know the ins and outs of assault rifles, I can tell you what it's like to be on the other end of one,\" the Edmonton-area woman told the crowd. She said it's difficult to talk about the \"terror, confusion and panic.\n\"I can tell you something more needs to be done -- something more than thoughts and prayers.\"\nWith files from Ben Singer and Nicole Thompson in Toronto, Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton and Amy Smart in Vancouver \nHundreds out for Ottawa's March for Our Lives rally @ctvottawa pic.twitter.com/dJwlTbUAp0 \n\u2014 Annie BergeronOliver (@AnnieClaireBO) March 24, 2018 McGill student Cyril Yared graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland FL.

(Michael Mahoney)\nMichael was at work in Toronto when family members started calling. They had seen news of a shooting in downtown Windsor and photos of a man who looked like Matthew lying on a stretcher, receiving CPR.\nPolice shot Matthew 'multiple times' The older brother was on a plane and back in Windsor within hours, where he tried to comfort his distraught family and struggled to understand how this could have happened.\nOntario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has dispatched 10 investigators to do the same thing. On Friday they provided a small update \u2014 confirming Matthew was shot by two officers and \"struck multiple times.\" \nWindsor police have reported two officers were injured in the confrontation that led up to the shooting, but are barred from commenting further on the shooting until the SIU completes its investigation.

Row Expressway when they passed the plastic flowers of a roadside memorial to someone who died in a crash.\n\"My brother was worried about the family that must have been in that accident and that was what he was always like,\" said Michael. \"That's all he talked about for the rest of the car ride over, worrying about if the family was OK.\"\n'This didn't need to happen' Now it's the Mahoneys who are not OK as the realization that Matthew is gone starts to sink in and the worries their good memories about him will start to fade.\nIt's not easy for Michael to talk about his brother's constant battle with his mental health. He said Matthew often called police when he was hurting and \"lots of good police showed him a lot of patience,\" but the family always worried about what would happen if he ran into officers when he was in a bad place.\nMental health commission calls for more experts in police training \nThey fear that's what happened on Wednesday.\n\"We're struggling to understand all of the places were people that could have helped my brother had their hands tied and couldn't,\" said Michael. \"There were so many opportunities where we could have helped.
