They've been doing it for years, and are good for one every few months. That said, this week it released a new one, this time using the hype to highlight its PlayStation 4 exclusive line-up. \nLike past videos, the new one clips together footage of multiple games -- complimented by hype-inducing music and big text -- all showing off a range of games Sony is \u00e2\u0080\u009cproud to say are only on PlayStation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nIf you seen one of these trailers, you've seen them all. This specific one includes both games already available exclusively on the platform, as well as ones slated to hit it soon. The following games are spotlighted: Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Detroit: Become Human , The Last of Us Part II, God of War , Days Gone, Shadow of the Colossus, Gran Turismo Sport, The Inpatient, Concrete Genie, Dreams, Blood and Truth, Hidden Agenda, and Bravo Team. \nAs you would expect, there was no love for the PlayStation Vita, and only a little bit of love for PlayStation VR, with much of the hype-train powered by PS4 games. \nWhether there is meaning behind the absence of games like Death Stranding, Wild , or Ghost of Tushima , is hard to say. There could be a calculated reason for their absence, or none at all. After all, other games such as Moss and Persona 5 are also missing, as well as many other titles. \nNonetheless, the purpose of the video is to simply build some marketing hype, which it successfully does. And given that Sony has Detroit: Become Human, God of War, Spider-man , and more coming this year, it has a reason to be excited. 0 comments \nPersonally, of Sony's line-up I'm looking forward to God of War the most. The combination of everything I've seen looking impressive and the huge marketing push from Sony has me excited and anticipating a game of game of the year material. \nGiven that's already almost April, this very well might be the last hype video we see before E3 in June, which is fine, the more hype saved for E3 the better.

They\u2019re driving to the building just off Mound Road, between 15 Mile and 16 Mile roads. The dreary route is riddled with potholes. There\u2019s no big sign directing anyone to anything in particular. The setting is an industrial park. Secret handshake? Viewing is by appointment only. Callers schedule visits months and years in advance. While access at the locked front door doesn\u2019t require a secret handshake, it probably should. \"Holy smokes. I've never seen anything like this,\" said Robert Wall, 89, a Detroit native who has attended every Motor City auto show since 1937. \"I had no idea this existed. I couldn't have imagined this in my wildest dreams. I could stay forever.\" He was rationed to 90 minutes. To those who know nothing about cars or think they care little, well, there are simply no words. This is a design mecca. Everything is labeled with historical explanation and auto industry impact.

(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) GM may be considered a front-runner on electrification today, but it\u2019s clear the institutional knowledge spans decades, said Greg Wallace, who has helped develop the collection over the past two decades as manager. (On this day, he was filming segments for the History Channel.) A study in innovation \"The collection tells a story of the history of the automobile and our fascination with car culture,\" said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, the world's leading classic car insurer based in Traverse City. \"You're actually able to study the thinking and innovation of the company and see how things were applied or not applied to production vehicles.\" Oh, and those Smart micro cars that tuck neatly into puny parking spaces in New York and San Francisco? Don\u2019t miss their predecessor, a 1969 512 Electric Experimental. Buy Photo \nA 1969 General Motors 512 electric experimental car is in the collection of the GM Heritage Center. Built to be an urban two seater with fiberglass body and steel chassis, it utilized special Delco-Remy lightweight lead-acid batteries taking 7 hours on a complete recharge from a 115-volt household outlet. The car\u00d5s range at 25 miles an hour is 58 miles. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) Visitors learn that the word \u201ccranky\u201d comes from drivers in the early 1900s having a bad day crank-starting the car. The crankshaft would kick back and break a thumb or a wrist and, on occasion, come out of the crank hold and hit the operator in the head, Wallace said. Vehicles from the 1900s have headlight covers that open to reveal a lantern wick inside. Steering wheels in 1912 were on the right, not left. (Ford put so many steering wheels on the left side that eventually everyone else did too, Wallace pointed out.) Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, said classic car junkies can't help but savor trips to the Heritage collection. \"All of the significant show cars are there \u2013 the Y-Job, the Le Sabre, the Firebirds \u2013 as well as the company\u2019s iconic production cars \u2013 the Tri-Five Chevys, the 1959 Cadillac, the split-window 1963 Corvette, the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am Special Edition,\" he said. \"But there\u2019s also a strong collection of technologically significant cars \u2013 not as flashy but equally important.\" The first V8! Cars like the 1912 Cadillac, the first auto with an electric starter; the 1915 Cadillac, with the first mass-produced V8 engine; and the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, the first front-wheel drive American car since the 1930s. The first electric starter meant people of smaller stature, who lacked upper body strength, could start cars for the first time on their own. And the V8 engine created a new industry standard for more powerful vehicles.

In 1912, Cadillac won the Dewar trophy for the electric starter and electric lights. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) \"I admire GM for saving examples of less-than-stellar products, too,\" Anderson said. \"One of my favorite vehicles at the GM Heritage Center is a 1976 Chevrolet Chevette \u2013 no one\u2019s idea of a collector car today, but one that sold in the millions in its time. Cars like the Corvette made GM\u2019s image, but cars like the Chevette made its bottom line.\" In the beginning, the goal was just to try and preserve history, Wallace said. \"I had no idea it would turn into what it has,\" he explained. \"Once history is gone, it's gone. I wanted to make sure we could tell our story down the road.\" Now visitors can track a nation's highs and lows, changes and progress. \"You can see prosperity and optimism through the '40s, then where the industry was in hiatus from '42 to '47 for the war and then it all starts back up again. Wealth and prosperity was growing,\" said Mike Simcoe, vice president of global design for GM. \"You see the industry wrestling with the change of fuel economy targets in the late '70s, with more stringent safety requirements, crash requirements, and the way some of those regulations were applied and how it impacted the structure of the vehicles. The '80s were an odd period, in fashion and style generally. I can say this in confidence, I have photos of myself.\" Unlikely to be public Some visitors whisper their desire to see the GM collection turned into a public exhibit on the Detroit riverfront one day, a stone's throw from the company's world headquarters in the Renaissance Center. \"It would be amazing,\" said Eddie Alterman, editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine. \"At the height of its power, GM was seen as the trailblazer \u2014 the Tesla of its time. And the company continues as an innovation leader in ways people don\u2019t fully appreciate.\" The vehicles are so carefully maintained and protected that there's no plan to make the exhibit public, though it can be reserved for group tours, conferences and special events. Despite being a secret, 300-plus events and tours were held in 2017.

The Channel 7 veteran, whose contract was not renewed by the Detroit station, was choked up as she signed off for her final noon newscast. So was meteorologist Hally Vogel, who was delivering the weather for the noon news. \"JoAnne, you are a wonderful person, coworker, friend. And just to say you will be missed is a sore understatement,\" said Vogel, fighting back tears. \"We truly love you and are going to miss you.\" Broadcasting from Channel 7's glass booth inside the downtown Detroit Qube building, Purtan briefly thanked her friends and colleagues at the station and, in particular, all of the people watching at home. \"I thank you for inviting me into your homes for the last 20 years and, by the way, for all the heartfelt sentiments and well wishes on social media,\" she said. \"I want you to know I have read each and every comment on my Facebook page. I am truly grateful for, really, your love and support.\" Purtan posted March 9 on her Facebook page that she would be leaving the E.W. Scripps-owned television station because of corporate restructuring. Scripps has been making job cuts across its media properties. Her social media announcement was flooded with 5,300 Facebook responses representing a wave of disappointment and anger that Channel 7 was not renewing her contract. \"No way! What a mistake WXYZ! Joanne \u2014 you have always been my favorite \u2014 and the best female anchor \u2014 always a lady with class! WXYZ will lose me as a news viewer now,\" wrote Bevery Grau. An Emmy-winning anchor and reporter who juggled several duties at the station, Purtan also co-anchored \"The Now Detroit\" 4 p.m. newscast, served as a consumer reporter for \"Don't Waste Your Money\" segments and provided weekly profiles of local female entrepreneurs for \"Mom's a Genius\" segments. Also read: Maddox out at WXYZ following harassment suit Purtan's tenure at WXYZ began in 1998. As a prominent Detroit TV figure, she joined the family media tradition of her father, iconic Motor City radio deejay Dick Purtan. Earlier this month, her father shared his pride for his daughter's career and his feelings about her departure on his official Facebook page. \"This is a speed bump in a wonderful career \u2014 and her mother and I have no doubt that there will be much smooth sailing for her down the road,\" he wrote.

In her March 9 Facebook post, she indicated she plans to remain in metro Detroit. \"I'm excited about what the future has to bring, but I will particularly miss this time together over the lunch hour every day,\" Purtan concluded. \"Thank you for watching and God bless.\" Contact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.

(Fox News) President Trump retained the law firm diGenova & Toensing this week to represent him in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election, sources told Fox News on Thursday. Reports this week suggested Joseph diGenova had joined Trump\u2019s outside legal team, alongside Jay Sekulow, but a source confirmed to Fox News that his wife and law partner, Victoria Toensing, also would represent the president. \nToensing served as deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the Justice Department under the Reagan administration, and as an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit. Toensing was chief counsel for then-Sen. Barry Goldwater, who sat as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \ndiGenova and Toensing, together, were appointed by the House of Representatives in 1997 as special counsel to investigate the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The two also were retained to investigate former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the Democrat's political surveillance controversy, also known as Troopergate. Victoria Toensing reacts to indictment in Uranium One case \nThere have been concerns of a potential conflict of interest with diGenova and Toensing representing the president in Mueller\u2019s investigation, after Toensing\u2019s representation of former key witnesses in the probe. \nRecently, Toensing represented Mark Corallo, an ex-spokesman to former Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz, in his interview with the special counsel\u2019s team. Toensing also represented Sam Clovis, a 2016 Trump campaign associate who supervised George Papadopoulos, in Clovis' Mueller interview. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the FBI as part of the special counsel\u2019s probe. Toensing also represented Erik Prince, a former informal adviser to Trump, who allegedly attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in Seychelles, that Mueller reportedly is investigating. \nBut Corallo told Fox News on Thursday there was no conflict of interest. \n\u201cI signed a waiver acknowledging I see no potential conflicts with their representation of the President,\u201d Corallo told Fox News in an email on Thursday, explaining it was a \u201cstandard\u201d waiver of \u201cpotential conflict.\u201d \nA source close to diGenova and Toensing told Fox News that Corallo, Clovis and the president signed a waiver. \n\u201cThe conflict is owned by the client. The conflict privilege is owned by the client,\u201d the source told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s the clients who have the privilege to waive. And the president waived it too.\u201d Toensing: FBI, DOJ sought to clear Clinton, frame Trump \nThe source told Fox News that when one attorney at a firm is retained, the entire firm is retained, and when one attorney has a conflict, the entire firm as a conflict, pointing to Ted Olson. \n\u201cIf one lawyer has a conflict, they all do. Ted Olson, who wanted to join the team couldn\u2019t\u2014his law firm represents Fusion GPS,\u201d the source said. \nOlson, a former solicitor general, was invited to join the president\u2019s legal team but declined, a source with knowledge of the outreach told Fox News. Olson's firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Fusion GPS\u2014the research firm behind the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier. \nThe news of Toensing\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s team came after the president\u2019s lead attorney John Dowd resigned, and Trump \u201cgraciously accepted.\u201d \nDowd had voiced strong opposition to the president doing an interview with Mueller. \nBut on Thursday, when Trump was asked if he wanted to testify before the special counsel\u2019s team, the president responded, \u201cYes. I would like to. I would like to.\u201d \nFox News\u2019 John Roberts contributed to this report. \nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter at @brookefoxnews .

It\u2019s been going on my entire life.\u2019\u2019 \nPresident Donald Trump was in Florida for the weekend. A motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club in the morning. As of early afternoon, he had yet to weigh in on Twitter about the protests. Advertisement \nThe NRA went silent on Twitter in the morning, in contrast to its reaction to the nationwide school walkouts against gun violence March 14, when it tweeted a photo of an assault rifle and the message \u2018\u2018I'll control my own guns, thank you.\u2019\u2019 \nAbout 30 gun-rights supporters staged a counter-demonstration in front of FBI headquarters in Washington, standing quietly with signs such as \u2018\u2018Armed Victims Live Longer\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Stop Violating Civil Rights.\u2019\u2019 Other gun-control protests around the country were also met with small counter-demonstrations. \nOrganizers of the big rally in the nation\u2019s capital hoped their protest would match in numbers and spirit last year\u2019s women\u2019s march, which far exceeded predictions of 300,000 demonstrators. \n\u2018\u2018We will continue to fight for our dead friends,\u2019\u2019 Delaney Tarr, another survivor of the Florida tragedy, declared from the stage. The crowd roared with approval as she laid down the students\u2019 central demand: a ban on \u2018\u2018weapons of war\u2019\u2019 for all but warriors. \nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 9-year-old granddaughter Yolanda Renee King gave a rousing speech at the Washington rally, drawing from the civil rights leader\u2019s most famous words. \n\u2018\u2018I have a dream that enough is enough,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\u2019\u2019 \nIn Parkland, the police presence was heavy as more than 20,000 people filled a park near the school, chanting slogans such as \u2018\u2018Enough is enough\u2019\u2019 and carrying signs that read \u2018\u2018Why do your guns matter more than our lives?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Our ballots will stop bullets.\u2019\u2019 \nGun violence was also fresh for some in the Washington crowd: Ayanne Johnson of Great Mills High in Maryland held a sign declaring, \u2018\u2018I March for Jaelynn,\u2019\u2019 honoring Jaelynn Willey, who died Thursday two days after being shot by a classmate at the school. The classmate also died. \nRallying outside the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord, 17-year-old Leeza Richter said: \u2018\u2018Our government will do more to stop us from walking out than it will to stop a gunman from walking in.\u2019\u2019 \nSince the bloodshed in Florida, students have tapped into a current of gun control sentiment that has been building for years \u2014 yet still faces a powerful foe in the NRA and its supporters. \nOrganizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting with the midterm congressional elections this fall. In addition to pushing for tighter gun laws, the students have been working to register young people to vote. \nPolls indicate public opinion in the U.S. may be shifting on the issue. \nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened. That is up from 61 percent in 2016 and 55 percent in 2013. \nOverall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun laws. \nAt the same time, the poll found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. \nAssociated Press writers Terry Spencer in Parkland, Florida; Jacob Jordan in Atlanta; and Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report .

It\u2019s just crazy, like can\u2019t believe it\u2019s really happening, but it\u2019s happening today.\u201d The grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Detroit Police Athletic League\u2019s new field \u2014 the Corner Ballpark and the Willie Horton Field of Dreams \u2014 occurred on the grounds of the old Tiger Stadium in Corktown. The site will serve as the new headquarters and stadium for Detroit PAL, a non-profit that provides athletic, academic, and leadership programs for thousands of children each year. \u201cWe hope this serves as a shining example of what kids in Detroit deserve to have,\u201d Detroit PAL CEO Tim Richey said at the ceremony. \u201cWe hope this corner is a beacon for corners across Detroit.\u201d Eight children who won the Detroit PAL First Pitch Essay Contest threw ceremonial first pitches before an afternoon game between two PAL teams: the Aztecs and another team consisting of the Stars, Greyhounds, Detroit Yankees and Detroit Hurricanes. \nThe PAL mascot gets ready to toss a ceremonial pitch during the grand opening ceemonies of the Corner Ballpark presented by Adient on Saturday, March 24, 2018 in Detroit.

His mother, Yolanda Moore, 43, of Royal Oak described it as a \u201cblessing\u201d to get to see her son take the mound Saturday afternoon on the historic grounds versus Martin Luther King, Jr. High School of Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to see the hard work that we put in,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut to be able to give back to the community and be down here and see everyone fellowship and just be able to do something positive for the face of Detroit, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Read More: Could train depot be Ford's millennials magnet? PAL secured more than $20 million in donor gifts to build the Willie Horton Field of Dreams and the 8,500 square-foot headquarters and banquet hall, according to a PAL news release. The field is 9.5 acres and maintains the dimensions of the former field. Construction began in June 2016, and the former Major League Baseball stadium was razed in 2009. There was some controversy surrounding the development, including concerns about the turf -- which replaced the grass field -- and over whether the new site would leave enough time for youth leagues and the general public. The Free Press previously reported that Richey told residents at least 51% of activities will be devoted to youth, and that PAL will ensure there are daily public hours. But it will offer the field for private use during daytime hours when children are in school. Former United States Senator Carl Levin told the crowd on Saturday that he fought in the senate to protect the field, even though the stadium was lost. \u201cThis land was unique,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThere was only one field like this in the world.\u201d Bob Selwa, who had attended games at the old Tiger Stadium from 1951 until 1999, said it wasn\u2019t until Saturday morning that he had a chance to step out on the field and walk the bases, one by one.

But make no mistake. Residents of Cleveland enjoy a benefit beyond the NBA Cavaliers' recent championship that doesn't exist in Detroit: Cheap auto insurance. A Free Press examination found that auto insurance premiums in Cleveland are often thousands of dollars a year lower than the highest-in-the-nation rates that Detroiters pay. For example: A former Cleveland City Councilman who drives a BMW and has had multiple drunken-driving convictions pays less than $100 a month. A new resident pays about $65 per month for a Honda Accord, just slightly more than he did in the suburbs. A Cleveland couple in their 30s pays about $100 each month for two vehicles. In Detroit, a sub-$100 monthly auto insurance premium is the stuff of fantasy \u2014 even for those with perfect driving records and excellent credit. One state lawmaker with a good driving record, for example, pays more than $400 a month. Cleveland's low rates persist even as insurers in Ohio use the same non-driving factors when setting premiums that critics say unfairly penalize people in high-poverty cities like Detroit. Those factors include drivers' home ZIP codes, a version of their credit scores and whether they have four-year college degrees. Some say this insurance industry practice is especially discriminatory to black people \u2014tantamount to \"redlining\" areas where they live \u2014 and a major reason for Detroit's sky-high rates that can exceed $3,000 a year to insure a single vehicle. \"We\u2019re simply charged for being black in Detroit,\" state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, D-Detroit, said during debate in Lansing last fall on a proposed auto insurance overhaul that was voted down. But insurance experts say the huge contrast between Detroit's and Cleveland's auto rates isn't because racial or class discrimination by insurance companies is any worse in southeast Michigan than in northeast Ohio. Instead, it's another example of how Michigan's one-of-a-kind no-fault insurance system, which mandates that all motorists buy coverage for potentially unlimited medical benefits, forces Detroiters to pay so much more than anyone else. Read more: Ohioans pay less, get less than Mich. no-fault A Free Press investigation last year found that in Detroit, these no-fault benefits present a lucrative target for profit-seeking medical clinics, lawyers and accident victim solicitors. These profiteers reel in Detroiters who were in accidents with promises of up-front cash, benefits to friends and relatives to be their attendant-care providers, and hopes of a much larger payout in negligence lawsuits. In Michigan, \"you require everyone to have this generous, well-funded insurance, which costs a lot in part because since it's really generous, people are going to use it a lot,\" said Paul Heaton, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who authored a 2010 report on Michigan's no-fault system. Suburbs vs. city The Free Press found that Cleveland residents, like Detroiters, are indeed charged more for car insurance than drivers in many nearby suburbs. But the price difference there between city and suburban markets is only about $7 to $30 per month, according to interviews with Cleveland-area drivers and insurance agents. By comparison, Detroit drivers can see a 50% drop in their insurance rates if they cross city limits and move to suburbs. The Free Press looked at Cleveland because, although smaller in population than Detroit, it is another major Midwest city in a neighboring state with similar weather and population demographics \u2014 Cleveland is Ohio's largest black-majority city. A reporter found numerous Clevelanders who pay less than $100 per month per vehicle for full liability and collision coverage. Buy Photo \nCatholic priest David Schlegel, 56, moved to Cleveland early this year from a suburb and pays the equivalent of $65 a month for his 2010 Honda Accord. (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) A Catholic priest in his 50s who moved to Cleveland this winter pays the equivalent of $65 a month for his 2010 Honda Accord, only slightly more than what he was charged in a Cleveland suburb about 28 miles away. \"I think it was $50 per year, the change in rates\" moving to Cleveland, said the Rev. David Schlegel, who is 56. \"I thought it would be much more.\" In one of Cleveland's most expensive ZIP codes, full coverage for a 45-year-old man driving a newer vehicle could run about $115 to $120 per month, said Raul Santos, a manager at a Young America Insurance office on Cleveland's west side. For a younger man of 25, the rate could be about $160 per month, he said. Some of the cheapest insurance the Free Press found belonged to a Cleveland millennial who said he pays about $200 every six months for just liability coverage on his 2000 Lincoln Town Car. That comes out to just $33 a month. \"I think it's a fair rate,\" 26-year-old Arthur Kostendt said. A Cleveland couple in their early 30s snagged a particularly good bargain for full coverage; they pay just $79 a month for two vehicles. (Model years 2011 and 2012.) Mike Vakos, the agent who sold that policy, said the couple likely had very good credit histories. The cost difference between good credit and bad credit is roughly 30% for a Cleveland auto premium, he said. Buy Photo \nState Rep.

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) Some Detroiters are charged triple that amount or more, including state Rep. Leslie Love, D-Detroit, who drives a 2009 Saturn Aura that is parked in her garage on the city's west side. She said her annual insurance premium on the car dipped below $4,300 last year, then inexplicably shot back above $5,000 for 2018 \u2014 more than $400 per month. Her annual premium is essentially the car's resale value, according to the Kelley Blue Book website . \"I have a friend in Ohio who just pities me,\" said Love, who is in her 40s. She is one of the few Democrats who voted in favor of last fall's unsuccessful no-fault overhaul bill. Few complaints in Cleveland Residents of urban areas generally pay more for auto insurance than those in less-populated ones because of busier roadways, more frequent crashes and more theft. But it's the large expense of no-fault benefits on top of general urban factors that makes insurance in Detroit so expensive. Insurance companies use ZIP codes to contain the costs of claims to the areas where people who generated the claims live, raising premiums for everyone who garages a car there. \"That's why it's more expensive in Detroit, because the people you're grouped with are more likely to have a claim, and that claim has a likelihood of being far higher than in Cleveland,\" said James Lynch, chief actuary at the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, an industry-funded organization. Car insurance affordability is not the pressing issue in Cleveland that it is in Detroit, where an estimated 60% of residents drive illegally without insurance, largely because of the high cost. The Free Press could not find any Clevelanders who thought that their city was being unfairly punished by higher insurance rates. \"They complain about the potholes more than the car insurance,\" said Clevelander D.J. Johnson, 50, who said he pays about $70 per month to insure his 2015 Toyota Camry. Asked whether they worried about Ohio's lack of a strong safety net for survivors of bad car crashes, several Cleveland drivers said they hadn't given that idea much thought. \"That's a good question,\" said Schlegel, the Catholic priest. \"I never have (been in a bad accident), so thanks be to God.\" Buy Photo \nZack Reed, 55, a former Cleveland City Council member, says he pays under $100 a month to insure his 2008 BMW. \"I pay less than $100 a month and I live in a neighborhood that people would say is somewhat crime-ridden,\u201d he says. (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) Zack Reed, 55, who was on Cleveland City Council from 2001 until late last year, said that car insurance never came up as a big issue during his time in office. \"I was on council for 17 years, and in my 17 years I can tell you that I have not heard one complaint that's ever come to me based on car insurance,\" Reed said. Reed's own driving record isn't perfect. He was convicted of his third DUI in 2013. Following that, the cost of insuring his 2008 BMW jumped to $151 a month. Now five years later, his monthly rate is back to double digits. \"I pay less than $100 a month and I live in a neighborhood that people would say is somewhat crime-ridden,\" Reed said. \"My insurance cost is lower than my cable.\" No-fault to blame The Zebra , an insurance comparison website, looked at both cities in its nationwide auto insurance analysis between September and December 2017. The analysis was based on a 30-year-old single male with a good driving history driving a 2013 Honda Accord EX. It found Cleveland with a $1,277 average annual auto premium for comprehensive coverage. In Detroit, the average was $5,414. \"Detroit is more than three times what Cleveland is, which is truly remarkable when you think of the proximity of the cities and the states,\" said Alyssa Connolly, the website's communications director. She noted how insurance rates reflect numerous factors, likely accounting for how Cleveland has a smaller population than Detroit (385,809 versus 627,795 by the latest estimates), as well as less than half as many reported auto thefts and roughly 25% fewer vehicle crashes. Still, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of those other factors are significant enough to make rates three times what they are in Cleveland,\" Connolly said. \"All signs seem to be pointing to the no-fault coverage laws in Michigan.\u201d The Ohio Four A Free Press reporter did learn of Ohioans who pay Detroit-level car insurance rates. Four people, exactly. That is the number of drivers in Ohio's last-chance auto insurance program for those whose driving records are so atrocious, no commercial insurer will take them. Yearly premiums for this Ohio Automobile Insurance Plan run about $4,000, said Dean Fadel, the program's manager. \"We've only got four people in the plan,\" said Fadel, who is also president of the Ohio Insurance Institute, a trade group. \"Our last-resort mechanism may be even cheaper than what your regular mechanism is\" in Detroit. Racism the real problem? During last fall's debate in Lansing on the proposed no-fault overhaul, some lawmakers said they couldn't support the legislation because it still permitted insurance companies to use factors such as ZIP codes and non-driving records in setting rates, a practice they believe is discriminatory. \"They don't want to address the root cause of the problem,\" state Rep. Fred Durhal III, D-Detroit, told Crain's Detroit on why he voted no. State Rep. Rose Mary Robinson, D-Detroit, said she also opposed the bill for that reason, among others. \"I just think it's unfair that it was geared to Detroit without resolving the issues of redlining, and all the negative things that historically have been counted against people in Detroit,\" she said this month. The centerpiece of the bill would have given all Michigan motorists a first-ever choice in the amount of no-fault coverage that they must buy. But critics voiced concern that the new options would lure consumers into making irresponsible choices by selecting only the cheapest coverage \u2014 and later regretting it after a bad accident. Also controversial, the bill would have reduced no-fault insurance reimbursement to medical providers by establishing price controls, known as a fee schedule, similar to what exists in Michigan's workers' compensation program, although a bit more lucrative. Despite support from Detroit's Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan, the bill was ultimately voted down 63-45 in the House of Representatives when most Democrats opposed it. Insurers deny 'redlining' There is a history in metro Detroit and across the country of banks, mortgage lenders and real estate agents in the past denying equal services to blacks and those living in predominantly minority areas. A report last year on auto insurance discrimination and redlining by ProPublica and Consumer Reports found that insurers in four states \u2014 not including Michigan \u2014 have been charging drivers in minority-majority ZIP codes significantly higher rates than similar drivers in white-majority neighborhoods, despite fewer insurance claims in the minority areas. The insurance industry contested the report's findings and methodologies. In Michigan, auto insurers have strongly denied allegations of racism and discrimination concerning Detroit rates. Studies have found that credit scores are actually good predictors for the number and total cost of insurance claims that drivers may file in the future. \"The effectiveness of these factors that get pointed at have been proved over and over and over again,\" Lynch said, the Insurance Information Institute actuary. He noted how many people accept that young drivers will have higher insurance rates, even though age is also a non-driving factor. A past actuarial study found some justification for the high auto rates in Detroit. The study, conducted for the City of Detroit by Bloomington, Ill.-based Pinnacle Actuarial Resources and released in 2015 found Detroiters used the medical benefits portion of no-fault, known as personal injury protection, twice as often and for twice the average claim amount as policyholders in the suburbs \u2014 $60,000 in Detroit versus $32,000 among suburban drivers. \nThe Cleveland skyline from Edgewater Park in Cleveland. (Photo: Mark Duncan, AP) Competition holds down rates? During last fall's debate on the no-fault overhaul, several lawmakers cited the legislation's lack of a long-term requirement for lower premiums as one of the reasons they couldn't support it. The mandated price reduction \u2014 40% off the no-fault benefits portion of some policies \u2014 expired after five years. Insurers also weren't compelled to offer the full reduction if it would cause them to lose money. In Ohio, there is no statutory requirement for auto insurers to keep rates at certain levels. Fadel, the Ohio Insurance Institute head, said that general competition among insurance companies is what helps to keep Ohio rates some of the nation's lowest. \"I can tell you the companies here fiercely vie for consumers' business. They all know that price is a major \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 factor in a consumer's purchasing decision,\" he said. Tort vs. no-fault In Ohio, the auto insurance of the driver who caused a crash pays for victims' medical and vehicle damage bills \u2014 but only up to a point. The payout is often determined by the size of the at-fault driver's liability coverage or the victim's own underinsured motorist protection policy. People who cause a crash generally rely on their own private health insurance for medical bills. Ohioans can also sue at-fault drivers for damages beyond the coverage limits in an auto insurance policy. At-fault motorists in Ohio are on the hook for what their insurance plan doesn't cover. But these lawsuits are not guaranteed windfalls because many defendants lack sizable personal assets and judgments can be discharged in bankruptcy, according to several Ohio accident attorneys. The system is very different in Michigan. Under no-fault, auto insurers pay the lifetime medical bills of insured drivers and the drivers' passengers, regardless of who caused the accident. No-fault also provides lost wages and in-home chores money and attendant care for basic needs. The trade-off for these extensive benefits is Michigan's higher legal hurdles for suing negligent drivers. Those lawsuits succeed only if someone was killed or suffered a serious bodily impairment in the crash. Lower prices, greater risk Nationwide, 38 states have a tort-based system similar to Ohio's and 12 states use no-fault rules. Nevada, Georgia, Connecticut and Colorado completely dropped no-fault in response to rising costs. In Michigan, no-fault benefits claims have been rising fast and now far exceed collision payouts. The average no-fault claim in the state for so-called \"personal injury protection\" was $56,207 last year, more than double the 2007 average of $25,689, according to insurance industry data from the Independent Statistical Service. The average Michigan collision claim rose 40% to $3,811 during the same period. And the bigger the claims, the higher the auto insurance rates for Michigan drivers. A survey by carinsurance.com put the average Michigan premium at $2,484 a year, the most expensive in the country. Ohio drivers aren't mandated to buy medical coverage with their car insurance \u2014 a money-saver on their premiums. Ohio has some of the lowest auto insurance rates in the nation, averaging $952 a year according to the carinsurance.com survey. Yet without no-fault-type coverage, Ohioans are at greater risk of financial ruin should they be seriously hurt in an accident and forced to take time off work. For the catastrophically injured, the final stop in Ohio can be a Medicaid-funded nursing home. \"Medicaid, what they provide \u2014 you're like a beggar. It's just substandard care,\" said Ronald Smolarski, owner of Beacon Rehabilitation Services in Ann Arbor who forecasts the future medical costs of severely injured people in several states. At least one Michigan lawmaker believes that Ohio's lower insurance rates are worth the risk. Jason Sheppard, R-Temperance, who lives about 1 mile from the state border, recently introduced a package of bills that calls for replacing Michigan's no-fault system with an Ohio-style system to lower statewide rates. Sheppard said that out of curiosity, he once got an Ohio insurance quote for his family's two vehicles. The Ohio rate was less than half the $4,000-plus annual premium that he currently pays for both. He said it's common to see Michigan residents who live near Ohio with Ohio license plates \u2014 and presumably cheaper Ohio insurance \u2014 after having registered their vehicles across the border at family members' addresses. Such a gambit is considered insurance fraud. So far, Sheppard hasn't heard any anecdotes involving the reverse: Ohioans trying to get Michigan no-fault insurance. \"The question becomes, 'is it that bad in Ohio?' \" he said.

The site will be open to the public at 9 a.m. Saturday and a ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. Guests will be able to tour the new facility and watch baseball games between metro Detroit high school teams, the news release states. \u201cThis is a very exciting time for Detroit PAL and the city of Detroit,\u201d said Tim Richey, CEO of Detroit PAL, in the statement. \u201cWith the help of our generous donors, we have been able to build a new home for PAL and our 14,000 girls and boys. This new stadium is a statement to PAL\u2019s commitment to the sports and programs we offer and the youth of Detroit.\u201d Read More: Dearborn mayor backs Ford's Detroit expansion The development hasn't been without its controversies, including concerns whether the new site would leave enough time for youth leagues and the general public and that the grass field would be replaced with turf. The Free Press previously reported that Richey told residents at least 51% of activities will be devoted to youths and that PAL will ensure there are daily public hours but will offer the field for private use during daytime hours when children are in school. PAL secured more than $20 million in donor gifts to build the 8,500-square-foot headquarters and banquet hall and the Willie Horton Field of Dreams presented by Meijer, according to a news release on PAL's website. Construction began in June 2016, and the old ballpark was razed in 2009. The Detroit Tigers last played there in 1999. \nTiger Stadium in 1999.

Carl Levin, according to a release. Events, including a private dinner, a donor wall unveiling, and a Paul W. Smith Live Remote, were planned for Friday. The sold-out dinner was to be the first event held in the new stadium and the first time the public will see the facilities, PAL stated in a news release. Tickets are still available for $75 for the MVP Afterglow from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday. The MVP Afterglow includes access to the facility and field, PAL said in a statement.
