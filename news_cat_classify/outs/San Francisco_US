By RONALD BLUM AP Baseball Writer \nMinor league baseball players who make as little as $5,500 a season were stripped of the protection of federal minimum wage laws under a provision in government spending legislation signed Friday. \nThe \"Save America's Pastime Act\" is included on page 1,967 of the $1.3 trillion spending bill and appears to pre-empt a lawsuit filed four years ago in U.S. District Court in San Francisco by three players alleging Major League Baseball and its teams violate the Fair Labor Standards Act and state minimum wage and overtime requirements for a work week they estimated at 50-to-60 hours. \nThe provision in the legislation exempts \"any employee employed to play baseball who is compensated pursuant to a contract that provides for a weekly salary for services performed during the league's championship season (but not spring training or the offseason) at a rate that is not less than a weekly salary equal to the minimum wage ... for a workweek of 40 hours, irrespective of the number of hours the employee devotes to baseball related activities.\" \nThe House approved the spending bill Thursday, the Senate followed early Friday and President Donald Trump signed the bill in the afternoon. \n\"Instead of going through the regular committee process where it has a hearing, all of this was done in secret and a in a very rushed manner,\" Garrett Broshuis, the lawyer for the players, said Thursday. \"It's emblematic of how things are getting done in Washington these days, where the people with a lot of money are able to flex their political muscle and make a lot of contributions and get things done in secret that benefit only them.\" \nMajor League Baseball spent $1.32 million on lobbying expenses in both 2016 and 2017, up from $330,000 in 2015, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. MLB paid $400,000 each of those years to an outside firm, the Duberstein Group, which reported lobbying the House and Senate on the issue, as did MLB's in-house lobbyist. \n\"We aren't billionaire business owners and billionaire team owners,\" said Broshius, a minor league pitcher from 2004-09 who later became a lawyer. \nThe language in the spending bill is nearly identical to a stand-alone bill introduced in 2016 by Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois.

Sullivan \nCalifornia Catholic Daily exclusive \nEvery year, the publishers of Latin Mass Magazine hold a conference in Monterey. At this year\u2019s conference on February 24 and 25, attendance doubled from the usual 100 to 200. The much higher attendance was attributed to great interest in the featured speaker: Bishop Athanasius Schneider. On the balcony outside the Latin Mass Magazine\u2019s conference in Monterey. \nCalifornians came from as far north as Redwood Valley, from San Francisco, San Jose, and Bakersfield, and from as far south as San Diego, while others traveled from Washington state, New Jersey, and other states. \nAnother example of how Bishop Schneider\u2019s presence drew people, on the Thursday evening before the conference, the bishop celebrated a pontifical Low Mass at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Oratory in San Jose. The large Five Wounds Portuguese National Church, where the oratory is located, was almost full for the Mass, with Catholics from all over the Bay Area in attendance. \nWhen news was posted on Facebook on Sunday night that Bishop Schneider would celebrate a Mass at Star of the Sea Church in San Francisco, the next morning before he went to the airport, forty or so Catholics were there even though the Mass was at 7:30 a.m. Bishop Schneider holds a white dove after the Pontifical Low Mass at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Oratory \nBishop Schneider is an auxiliary bishop in Astana, Kazakhstan, in central Asia. In spite of his being from a part of the world many Catholics know nothing about, he makes frequent appearances around the world, and his appearances make news. National Catholic Register referred to him as \u201cone of the leading voices of fidelity, continuity and tradition in the Church today.\u201d \nBishop Schneider celebrated two traditional Latin Masses during the conference and spoke about \u201cThe Relationship Between Tradition and Liturgy.\u201d Father Joseph Illo, pastor of San Francisco\u2019s Star of the Sea Church also spoke, about \u201cRecovering the Ancient Liturgy in San Francisco.\u201d Bishop Vasa (Santa Rosa), Archbishop Cordileone (San Francisco), Bishop Schneider (Astana, Khazakhstan) at the archbishop\u2019s residence Sun. night after the conference \nBishop Schneider\u2019s parents were ethnic Germans who were sent to a gulag under Stalin, and he learned how to treasure the traditional Catholic faith while the family practiced it in secret under Communist oppression. Baptized Anton, he took Athanasius as his religious name when he became a Canon of the Order of the Holy Cross. \nIn Rome at the Augustiana, he earned a doctorate in patristics, which he teaches in the seminary he helped build for his order. \nShocked at the age of 12 when he first saw people taking Communion in the hand, he \u201ccarried this pain in my soul,\u201d and it prompted him to write his 2009 book on the Eucharist, Dominus Est (It Is the Lord) .
