Loss from operations is expected to be in the range USD 5.8 to 6.5 million compared to USD 28.2 million loss in FY 2016. Cash and cash equivalents at 31 Dec 2017 were USD 28.2 million, compared to USD 19.2 million at 31 Dec 2016. Full-set of FY 2017 results will be published post delisting together with the invitation to the Annual General Meeting which is set for 22 June 2018 at Zurich Airport. \nBusiness Update \nFollowing a successful conclusion of the rights-issue announced in August 2017, the Company raised USD 19.5 million, before associated fees and stamp duty. Recording a closing cash balance at the end of 2017 of USD 28.2 million, the Group is well capitalised to continue to invest in its two new propositions Thingstream (IoT communications platform) and Connect Hub (mobile added value services to enterprise) which were introduced during 2017. \nOver the second half of 2017 and early 2018, the Company has made significant progress in simplifying the organisation in readiness for delisting at the end of April 2018. This is reflected in continuing restructuring activity to ensure the organisation can maximise the value from historical business lines in Device Solutions and Connect Core. These units continue to make a positive operating contribution to the Group, before allocating corporate overheads, allowing the proceeds raised in August to be allocated to developing new business opportunities with Thingstream and Connect Hub. The Device Solutions Division has continued to benefit from the extension of licencing deals as we continue to agree end-of-life terms with Java customers. All operating costs and the associated cash outflows relating to Versy have now ceased as the application has been withdrawn from use. \nThingstream \nDuring 2017, Thingstream has been successfully launched with pilot customers and has earned nominal revenue from early commercial deals. Early market feedback is encouraging, building on the technical recognition the Company received from IoT Evolution World magazine for IoT Product of the Year in the second half of 2017. These early customers are enabling Myriad to test its infrastructure and build up operating capabilities to support the future growth of the business. Early progress with commercial customers is steady as we seed the market with developer kits and begin to enter conversations with customers building their next generation of IoT solutions. \nThe continued focus in the first half of 2018 will be on building an ecosystem of enabling relationships with both hardware manufacturers and software platforms. This will help us to continue to build a strong opportunity pipeline to convert into recurring revenue in the coming year. \nConnect \nThe Connect Division, comprising USSD Core and Connect Hub operating segments, has maintained a strong presence in its key markets in Africa and Latin America, continuing to provide high quality service to major telco customers such as Orange and Telefonica. As the Company already communicated in early 2017, price pressure in our traditional USSD infrastructure business continues to persist, which triggered a decline in revenue from USSD Core in 2017 compared to 2016. \nThe business has encountered delays achieving reach agreements with mobile network operator partners in our target markets for Connect Hub, which means that the ability to launch commercial pilots for enterprise services and generate revenue is taking longer than initially expected. Myriad continues to pursue these opportunities and is now targeting achieving reach coverage with initial target countries and live commercial engagements in 2018. \nDelisting \nMyriad Group AG will delist from SIX Swiss Exchange on 30 th April 2018; the final day of trading on SIX will be 27 th April 2018. The Board of Directors will appoint BZ Bank Aktiengesellschaft to engage in over-the-counter trading of the Myriad Shares following the delisting of the Myriad Shares, further details regarding this will be provided shortly on the share info section of our web-site. \nInformation on Myriad\u2019s Annual Report and Annual General Meeting (AGM). \nFY 2017 audited Financial Results will be finalised after delisting from the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) and will consequently not be published through SIX. However, these 2017 financial statements will be made available on the financial publications section of our website at the end of May, at the same time as the invitation to our Annual General Meeting is issued. The Annual General Meeting is set for 22 June 2018 and will again be held at Zurich Airport, in the visitors room on Observation Deck B. -ENDS- \nAbout Myriad Group \nMyriad Group is driving the Internet economy through delivery of infrastructure and innovative services, embedded software, consumer applications and the Internet of Things with first-of-its-kind solutions.

Pe Lang at MuDA modular | n\u02da2 \nUpon entering MuDA, located on the ground floor of Switzerland\u2019s first high-rise building, one encounters a white space dotted with few simple-looking mechanical contraptions. What is most striking is not the sight, but the sound: something crinkling, then something dripping (or is it chirping?). The first work I encountered, titled modular | n\u02da2 is, in fact, comprised of small speakers hung with nylon thread to a series of black frames. When you move, the speakers emit a sound \u2013 you can decide what the sound is for yourself. \nHow does it work? \nThere is a sensor mounted to the ceiling that triggers a small motor that pulls on the nylon thread connected to the speaker membrane. When you move within the space, the motor ever so slightly shifts, causing the thread to elicit a sound from speakers. I will not give away any more secrets about the mechanics of the artworks (although the very helpful staff are happy to), but I think this work encapsulates the idea behind the exhibition: very small binary movements can create larger, seemly random assortments of sounds, images and reactions. modular | n\u02da2 moving objects | n\u02da703-1750 \nWhere did that crinkling sound come from? Lang\u2019s work entitled moving objects | n\u02da703-1750 is a wall of white sketch paper that upon closer inspection shifts and moves, producing the same sound you get from crumpling the first draft of an essay before binning it. \nLooking at the paper slowly shift and reshape is mesmerizing and meditative, but also looks like a stop-motion video of flowers blooming. moving objects | n\u02da703-1750 polarization | n\u02da 11 \nI tend to gravitate towards visual patterns, so I really enjoyed Lang\u2019s work entitled polarization | n\u02da 11 . It is a series of spinning plastic disks, interlinked with nylon thread and connected to motors that produce a random pattern of circles based on your position to the work. \nAgain, Lang uses simple materials and mechanical principles to make a fantastic, complex and ever-changing kaleidoscope of dots. polarization | n\u02da 11 Pe Lang at MuDA \nVery few of the works in the exhibition rely on digital technology. Pe Lang \u2019s educational background is in electrical skills and he is most known for his \u201csound objects.\u201d So why give him a solo show? It comes back to zeros and ones. \nI see Lang\u2019s work as an analogy for computer programming. The mechanics are simple \u2013 sometimes down to the imperceivable rocking of a metal rod \u2013 but are enough to create a cacophony of sound , wild patterns of light or dark, or beautiful new shapes and forms, just like binary code. \nThe exhibition challenges notions that mechanical and digital technology stand in opposition to nature, human interaction and the randomness of life. Lang\u2019s works rely on the physics of the natural world (water, light, air), require physical interaction and produce visual and audio outputs that are unpredictable and whimsical. \nThere are 7 new and previously shown Pe Lang works in MuDA \u2018s exhibition.
