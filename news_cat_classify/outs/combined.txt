The area of Buiksloterham in Amsterdam is our primary case study. In these three cahiers, we present our main findings. \n\nCahier #1 introduces our Hackable City-model and explains how it can be used to explore collaborative processes of citymaking in democratic societies. What new roles have emerged for citizens, (design) professionals and institutions, and how can collectives of citizens organized issues of communal concern interact with traditional institutions? Download here >> \n\nCahier #2 describes a series of design probes that explored cooperative area development in the Amsterdam brownfield redevelopment site of Buiksloterham. These probes were tailored to investigate specific aspects of \u2018hackable citymaking\u2019: collaborative practices between different stakeholders, where new media technologies are employed to open up urban institutions and infrastructures to systemic change, in the public interest. Download here >> \n\nCahier #3 explores a series of concrete hackable citymaking practices in Athens, Sa\u0303o Paulo and Shenzhen. Despite being situated on different continents and having distinct traditions and political systems, we found a number of dynamics around civic initiatives in these cities that further informed our Hackable city model. Download here >> \n\nMore about The Hackable City \nThe goal of this research project is to explore the opportunities as well as challenges of the rise of new media technologies for an open, democratic process of collaborative citymaking. How can citizens, design professionals, local government institutions and others employ digital media platforms in collaborative processes of urban planning, management and social organization, to contribute to a liveable and resilient city, with a strong social fabric? \nHackable citymaking revolves around the organization of individuals into collectives or publics, often through or with the aid of a digital media platform. Individuals contribute resources, such as knowledge, time, information or money, and at the same time reap some form of a benefit, be it social, economic or political, on an individual or communal level. \nThese collective projects are often (though not always) initiated and managed by professionals who have started to broaden their workfields. They are no longer \u2018just\u2019 designers, but have taken up the role of community organizers, fundraisers, storytellers, project developers, etc. \nThe collectives act within legal and democratic frameworks, often making use of resources or infrastructure provided by the city at large. Hackable Citymaking makes this relationship between collectives and institutions interactive. How can the governing and administrative institutions of the city learn from the initiatives taken by these collectives, and adjust their frameworks accordingly? \nOrganization \nThe first contours for this project were laid out by One Architecture and The Mobile City during the Metropool NL workshop organized by the Deltametropool Society in 2012, resulting in the publication Eindhoven, Hackable World City. \nThis was followed by an \u2018embedded researcher\u2019 project executed by Cristina Ampatzidou, hosted at the University of Amsterdam and One Architecture and funded by the Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam, with contributions from Utrecht University. \nIn 2013 funding was received from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for a KIEM-exploration (lead by Michiel de Lange at Utrecht University). And in 2014 NWO funded this as a Creative Industries research project hosted at the University of Amsterdam, The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), and One Architecture. For the latter, new partners joined the research coalition: The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, Pakhuis de Zwijger, and Stadslab Buiksloterham.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hackable city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buiksloterham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T19:34:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9883960094d9aa99481816f5a3803a7983c21479", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiQ2F6hWlN6YFzbZSipy5_ZlVc6_RZ2_JemrbTewJnsLCLS0w3ejAdO.WoT9Nf2xGJqGKvAvsBWACK.sMxOHyE", "site_full": "www.bullup.nl", "site": "bullup.nl", "site_section": "http://www.bullup.nl/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Bull Up Beleggerclub", "title": "Angst handelsoorlog houdt beurzen in greep", "title_full": "Angst handelsoorlog houdt beurzen in greep", "published": "2018-03-23T20:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bullup.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bullup.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9883960094d9aa99481816f5a3803a7983c21479", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiQ2F6hWlN6YFzbZSipy5_ZlVc6_RZ2_JemrbTewJnsLCLS0w3ejAdO.WoT9Nf2xGJqGKvAvsBWACK.sMxOHyE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Beleggen.nl", "published": "2018-03-23T20:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Angst handelsoorlog houdt beurzen in greep", "text": "  Angst handelsoorlog houdt beurzen in greep AMSTERDAM (AFN) \u2013 De Europese beurzen zijn de week in mineur ge\u00ebindigd.

Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nAt the end of 2015, artist Jeroen van Loon offered his entire DNA data \u2013 380 GB of personal data \u2013 for auction. The starting price was an extravagant 0 euro. Anyone could place a bid through www.cellout.me . A year later, the auction closed and the artist\u2019s full genome sold for 1100 euros to the Verbeke Foundation . \nThe highest bidder had just acquired an installation composed of the server cabinet where the data are stored, framed pictures documenting the DNA extracting and encoding processes, four letters written by experts as well something more difficult to fully grasp: an individual\u2019s entire DNA self-portrait. \nIn their letters, experts from very different fields attempt to untangle the meaning and implications of Cellout.me . Auction house Christie\u2019s Amsterdam seeks to estimate the artistic value of the artist\u2019s DNA; specialists at medical center ErasmusMC in Rotterdam looked at the ethical dimension of the artist\u2019s work and what it means to own his genome which they compare to the digital version of an individual. KPMG , a company with expertise \u201cin all things Big Data\u201d investigated the potential fluctuations of value of the artist\u2019s DNA through time. As for cybersecurity company Fox-It , they wrote perhaps the most dramatic note, they underline the fragility of this DNA which needs to be protected from the greed of \u2018gold miners\u2019 and other people or companies eager to speculate and profit from this new type of data. \nThe letters highlight how a project that can be summed up in a couple of words ( Artists Sells Own DNA for 1100 Euros!!! ) hides various levels of complexity, meanings, ramifications and uncomfortable questions regarding ownership, privacy, the place of DNA in big data and digital culture in general, bioethics, etc. \nThe selling of human DNA data. Artist talk by Jeroen van Loon at the Aksioma Project Space in Ljubljana on 21 March 2018 \nWhat are the consequences of owning someone else\u2019s DNA data? How does this influence the spatial privacy of the biological owner and his family members? \nThe installation is currently on view at Aksioma Project Space in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I took the exhibition as an excuse to contact Jeroen van Loon and ask him the questions above. And more: \nPhoto by Erik Borst : In front of the HiSeq DNA sequencer, which takes 2 weeks to sequence a full genome \nHi Jeroen ! The idea of selling your full genome might sound a bit abstract and too conceptual to most people. DNA is a very very long sequence of ACTGs (3 billion lines!) Could you briefly tell us about some of the ethical and cultural questions raised by the auction of your DNA data? \nThe main difference when thinking about selling DNA data (and I mean DNA data, not biological DNA) compared to other types of data \u2013 let\u2019s say credit card or social media data \u2013 is that DNA data is not constrained to one single person. DNA data is about me, but also about my sister, parents, grandparents and also my son. So when I decide to sell my DNA data, the first question one could ask is if it\u2019s even my data to sell. Who is the owner of my DNA data? Do I have any authorship or copyright concerning my DNA data? Should I inform my family members and ask for consent when doing something with my DNA data? Scientists call this characteristic of DNA data spatial privacy. Further more, if I find your DNA on a soda can and I sequence it, is it then my DNA data? \nApart from the selling questions, one of the main questions revolves around the monetary value of human DNA data. Because, how do you come up with a certain price tag for my DNA data when we discard the production price for the creation of that DNA data? What makes my DNA data any different \u2013 and more of less worthy \u2013 than yours? To make it more difficult, what we know today about human DNA data isn\u2019t the same as what we might know in let\u2019s say 15 years. The information value of human DNA data changes because of new scientific research. So linking the price tag to the current information level could also be problematic. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me, artist presentation at Aksioma Project Space.

Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nThe most distressing aspect of the work for me is that it projects you into a very uncertain future. Right now it\u2019s probably not very easy, practical nor affordable to faithfully transcribe someone else\u2019s genome and draw profit from it. But one day it might. And since you share the DNA material with your existing and future family, it means that your work might be of concern to them. Did you justify your work to them? How did they react to your project? \nYes, I explained my intentions and what I would do with my DNA data. Everybody found it interesting, some found it a little scary, including myself, and others, like my son, was, and is, too young to think anything about it. I did not ask anybody for consent, either in a formal or informal manner. You could call this egoistic, which it probably is. \nThe main reason for doing it this way is that you might otherwise not have asked this particular question. The artwork is not a metaphor, narrative or visualisation, it is a documentation of a real life action. And it is this action that creates the questions concerning this future digital culture I wanted to show. If it was not a real life action and thus without consequences, it would not have been able to ask these questions. \nThis is not to say that this does not scare me sometimes, but right now this discussion is in an \u2018ignorance is bliss\u2019 place in my mind. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : Isolating DNA from blood sample \nYou asked specialists from various fields to ponder upon the significance of the work. One of them was cybersecurity company Fox-It. In their letter , they insist on the need to protect this type data, because DNA is \u201cthe new gold\u201d and \u201caccess to the goldmine\u201d should be controlled. Yet, the description of the work states that \u201cThe artist decided not to stipulate a contract with the eventual buyer\u201d What motivated this decision? I\u2019m particularly curious about the absence of contract since it is so important   and encrypt it carefully, especially when the data is so personal. \nI came up with the idea to add a contract, which would state what the buyer could and couldn\u2019t do with the DNA data, during the final production stages of the artwork. I think I got cold feet. It was the same reason why I wanted to begin the auction price at the production price of the artwork. Both ideas were abandoned after conversations with fellow artists when I realised they would greatly damage the core idea behind the work. It would create a watered-down version of the artwork. \nWhen content becomes binary code we see the same questions pop up regarding copyright, authorship, piracy, privacy, original/copy, remix and so on. This happened to music, cinema, news, and will happen to our DNA data as well. When DNA sequence technology becomes easier, cheaper and more widely available, more companies/organisations will offer ways of e.g. sequencing, storing, sharing, owning, buying or selling DNA data. \nAs with all other types of digital content, DNA data will also be (il)legally recorded, shared, hacked, leaked, mixed and so on . My point was to show what kind of new questions could arise when human DNA data was sold, not to find the most secure way of transferring it. The actual selling asks not only these questions but also shows possible implications. \nWhat happened since you sold your DNA data? You just sent the whole installation to the Verbeke Foundation and then it disappeared from your preoccupations? \nMy focus as an artist is on visualising, documenting and revealing digital culture, not on DNA and its discourse. DNA was only my focus because it became data. So to be very honest; when the work was sold my preoccupation with my DNA data was finished. \nI try to keep up a little with news about DNA sequence possibilities. I recently saw a Dutch TV commercial in which they offered to sequence parts of your DNA for your, a sort of 23andMe.com . The fact that this is now on Dutch TV means that we will have to deal more and more with the questions surrounding data and DNA and therefor I feel happy to already have finished the work since I tried to reveal digital culture with this work. \nI did write a small text about my final reflections on the selling of my DNA data for Digimag Journal | Issue 75 | Digital Identities, Self Narratives . The interesting part was that a lot of people around me were encouraging me to place fake bids to get higher bids. Even journalists told me they would write about the work if the price would be higher. This really frustrated me, as if a work is only interesting if it\u2019s worth as much as possible. The strange thing was that during the last month of the auction I got the same feeling, \u2018the work is useless and failed if it\u2019s being sold for 500 euro\u2026\u2019 Which of course doesn\u2019t matter, it was only my own insecurities. The only thing that matter was that my DNA data was sold. For how much or little didn\u2019t matter, the selling itself was important, not the price. But it did get me thinking about what would change the price. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference in the order in which the 3 billion ACTG\u2019s are positioned, rather I think it could be a difference in context. Who sells it, when, where, how and why, meaning the value of DNA data resides in context rather than in production as perhaps is the case with all art. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me \u2013 selling human DNA data \nHave you never been worried by the fact that the work could have been bought by some private company that speculates on data? By Amazon or Google for example? \nI did, this was precisely the worry that made me think of the contract and start looking at the production price. The thing that scared me the most was that someone would buy it, analyse the sequenced data so they knew e.g. what my chances are on getting alzheimer\u2019s disease and publishing all this information so my family members could read about their own chances of getting it without having the chance to say \u2018no, I do not want to know this right now.\u2019. \nDuring the last 30 minutes of the year-long auction there where four different potential buyers of which one had a relation with the medical industry. What could have happened if Verbeke haden\u2019t bought it, I don\u2019t know, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be an artwork anymore, it would just be data. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : In ErasmusMC\u2019s data center: the hardware responsible for storing and analysing DNA \nPhoto by Erik Borst : Transferring 380gb of DNA data from ErasmusMC\u2019s data center to the artist\u2019s hard drive \nDo you think it could turn out that yours was actually a very wise move? That the Verbeke Foundation might do more to protect your DNA data than you (or anyone else) could do? That it now feels some kind of responsibility towards it? \nI never thought about it that way. Could be I guess. Since there is no contract they can do whatever they want with the work, sell it, show it, dismantle it, put it in a depot. I don\u2019t have any say in it, so when Aksioma asked me if it would be possible to show cellout.me , I first had to ask if I could loan the artwork. It would be interesting to document the opinion of Geert Verbeke , owner of the Verbeke Foundation , about his responsibility towards the artwork and the data. \nPhoto by Erik Borst : 3 vials of blood \nWas the \u2018blood-to-data\u2019 process a long and difficult one? What was it like and who did you work with? \nThe team of Andr\u00e9 Uitterlinden (Professor of Complex Genetics at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) helped me with understanding the procedure of sequencing my DNA and the actual sequencing. Through this understanding I could decide how many photos I needed to show the blood-to-data process. All photos were taken by Erik Borst , with which I discussed how the images should look. \nAfter generating a few blood samples the biological DNA was extracted from my blood. The sequencing itself took two full weeks, this was due the fact that my DNA data was sequenced in a 30-fold depth, meaning it was of laboratory quality. When the sequence was finished the data was checked by bioinformaticians, with which I discussed before hand what kind of output I needed for the artwork. The staff was extremely helpful and interested as they saw this work as an opportunity to communicate about their work and DNA in general. \nJeroen van Loon, Cellout.me, exhibition view at Aksioma Project Space. Photo : Jure Gor\u0161i\u010d / Aksioma \nI\u2019m also curious about the aesthetics of the piece. The final installation looks like a normal server cabinet, it could host any type of data. What guided your artistic decision to showcase and communicate the process this way? Was it just the most practical option? \nOne of the most difficult tasks during the production of the work was to think of the medium in which I wanted to show the DNA data. I found it very difficult to create a visual link between the auction and the actual data. In my mind, the medium in which I wanted to show the work didn\u2019t need to be an artistic representation or imagination. The work is not a visualisation, it is a documentation. I struggled with this because I was mainly thinking about how it was going to look inside a gallery. I thought of tripods, pedestals, mounted screens, framed harddisks, printed DNA code and so on, all terrible. \nThe night before I had to finished my proposal, I got the idea of using a server cabinet (don\u2019t remember how I got the idea), I found it the most honest way of documenting the auction and the data since I could use a screen for each. Showing the actual raw data file on one screen and the realtime auction results through the website www.cellout.me on another, all inside the same object. The tall blackish server cabinet itself is beautiful; it\u2019s nearly the same size as me, the glass door reflects you when your looking at the data, it\u2019s an object that people know, they relate it to data, datacenters, google, facebook and so on. It\u2019s a closed cabinet with the data inside as if it\u2019s an box waiting to be opened. It was the perfect medium to communicate my thoughts, and indeed a very practical one. \nWhat are you showing at Aksioma exactly? The full installation? Other materials? \nI\u2019m showing, with the help of the Verbeke Foundation, the full installation. The presentation consists of the server cabinet, the blood-to-data photo series and the four texts written by Christie\u2019s, ErasmusMC, KPMG and Fox-IT \u2013 which have an English translation that the audience can take home. \nThanks Jeroen ! \nCellout.me , Jeroen van Loon\u2019s solo show is at Aksioma in Ljubljana from 21 March until 20 April 2018.

Na twee optredens in Zuid-Afrika gaat vanavond het eerste concert van zijn Europese tour van start. In een uitverkochte Melkweg Max in Amsterdam zet Myles een show neer waarin hij nummers speelt van onder andere zijn soloalbum, Alter Bridge, Mayfield Four en Slash. \nDe agenda's van Alter Bridge en Slash zijn de afgelopen jaren goed op elkaar afgestemd. Als Slash op tournee is, blijft Alter Bridge thuis en dat geldt ook andersom. Nu Slash weer op het podium staat met zijn Guns n' Roses-'maatje' Axl en daarmee in korte tijd het begrotingstekort van de Nederlandse overheid verdient, is er ruimte ontstaan in de de agenda van Myles Kennedy. Daardoor kan Myles eindelijk zijn al jaren geplande soloalbum uitbrengen. Een album waarop de 'verlegen' zanger het verhaal vertelt van zijn overleden vader en de invloed die het heeft op zijn leven. \nDe avond wordt geopend door de Utrechter Jasper Mook . Jasper stond een aantal jaar geleden in de finale van het televisieprogramma De Beste Singer Songwriter Van Nederland . De muziek van Jasper ligt niet helemaal in lijn met die van Myles. Zijn repertoire is meer gericht op pop dan op rock. Het is hard werken voor Jasper om het publiek enigszins op zijn hand te krijgen. Aan zijn inzet en enthousiasme ligt het niet en op zijn nummers en zang is eigenlijk niets aan te merken. Echter, het moet wel je smaak zijn. Persoonlijk heb ik er niet zoveel mee en gezien de lauwe reacties van het publiek, ben ik blijkbaar niet de enige. \nNa het ombouwen van het podium (wat in dit geval niet meer is dan het uitpluggen van de gitaren van het voorprogramma, het krukje voor Myles op de juiste plaats zetten en het aansteken van de vier kaarsen) is het tijd voor Myles Kennedy om zijn soloshow te starten. Alleen op een podium, zonder ondersteuning van een band. \nBeperkt licht gaat aan, Devil On The Wall begint. Myles komt al gitaarspelend het podium op en wordt met open armen ontvangen door het publiek. De sfeer zit er vanaf de eerste noot al in. Vervolgens gaat Standing In The Sun van start met wat technische probleempjes doordat Myles zijn voetpedaal niet in de juiste stand heeft staan, wat gelukkig snel verholpen kan worden. Als hij daarna vervolgens van gitaar wisselt en al begint te spelen zonder dat de plug van de versterker er al in zit, schiet hij in de lach. De spanning valt van hem af. Als vervolgens Before Tomorrow Comes start, gaat het publiek helemaal los. \nTussen de songs door neemt de zanger alle tijd om verhalen, ervaringen en grapjes te vertellen. De reacties van het publiek toveren de hele avond een grote grijns op zijn gezicht. Van de 'verlegen' Myles is niet veel meer te zien. Zo vertelt hij bewust gekozen te hebben om de show sober te houden, want hij wil de muziek voor zich laten spreken. En dat lukt! De semi-akoestische muziek in combinatie met de karakteristieke, perfecte zanglijnen en de stem van Myles levert geregeld kippenvelmomenten op. \nVerrassend is het Led Zeppelin-nummer Going To California , waarbij je je afvraagt of de inspiratie hiervoor is ontstaan toen Myles betrokken was bij een Led Zeppelin-re\ufffdnie zonder Robert Plant. Ook Traveling Riverside Blues van de grondlegger van de blues - Robert Johnson - is opvallend te noemen. Dat het optreden echt live is, blijkt wel uit het feit dat Myles de songlist op het podium gewoon aanpast naar wat voor hem goed voelt of wat er uit het publiek wordt gevraagd. Niets geen bandjes of ondersteuning die meelopen. \nDe Alter Bridge-fans komen ruimschoots aan bod want er staan zeven songs op de setlist. Na het drieluik Wonderful Life, Watch Over You en Open Your Eyes is het tijd voor de toegift die bestaat uit de covers Levon van Elton John en het gevoelige Hallelujah van Leonard Cohen. Voor de laatste keer krijgt Kennedy van het publiek een uitzinnig applaus waarbij hij letterlijk alle credits verdient voor deze kwalitatief hoge performance. Solo op het podium met af en toe ondersteuning van tourmanager Tim Tournier, wanneer dit nodig is voor de muziek. Het enige dat achteraf opvalt aan deze avond is dat er maar vier nummers van zijn persoonlijke soloalbum op de setlist staan. \nWie verwacht had dat de serieuze teksten van Myles zijn Year Of The Tiger -album ook de stemming van het optreden zouden bepalen heeft het mis. Wat een magische en energieke show is er neergezet door Myles Kennedy. \nSetlist: 1. Devil On The Wall 2. Standing In The Sun (Slash & The Conspirators-cover) 3.

It is only the latest and most impressive result of feverish, multi-faceted diplomatic efforts by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to achieve a mobilisation of international organisations of which Greece is a member (the EU, Nato, and the UN), but also to draw the support individually of major international players - including the US, Germany and Russia - in order to shield Athens from Turkey\u2019s mounting aggressiveness and expansionist aspirations. Russia card: Putin invites Greek PM to Moscow Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a lengthy telephone conversation yesterday with Alexis Tsipras, invited the Greek PM to visit Moscow, and the two leaders discussed, among other issues, Greek-Turkish affairs and regional developments. Athens had every reason to be satisfied by the solidarity offered by its EU partners in defending Greece\u2019s sovereignty and avoiding a military clash. Solidarity from EU partners In the conclusions of the EU summit, European leaders expressed solidarity with Greece and Cyprus and condemned Turkey\u2019s behaviour with exceptionally strong language. Greek diplomatic sources underlined the EU\u2019s unprecedented use of the word \u201ccondemnation\u201d in responding to Turkeys\u2019 \u201cillegal activities\u201d and hostile behaviour towards Greece and Cyprus. At the same time, Athens received a commitment from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk, that they would push for the release of the two Greek army officers - who were captured by Turkish forces and imprisoned - at an EU-Turkey summit meeting on 26 March, in the Bulgarian city of Varna. Tsipras asked Juncker to request concrete guarantees from Erdogan that he will acknowledge the sovereign rights of Greece and undertake an initiative to free the two Greek army officers. At the summit, Tsipras also expressed solidarity with the UK regarding the recent attack with a nerve agent on its territory, but also stressed the need to maintain open channels of communication with Moscow. He said he supports the engagement of both the EU and Nato with Russia.

Indicatively, scheduled airline seats from Germany are up by 45 percent . SETE President Yiannis Retsos. \nHowever, Retsos underlined that the specific data, which was collected by January 31, is subject to continuous changes, as cancellations or extra flights may be added. A more accurate picture of the scheduled airline seats should be available by late May. \nAccording to SETE Intelligence data, Greece ranks among the top 10 most popular destinations for travelers from 16 from the largest tourism markets (except the United States and Russia). Greece is also in the top 5 Mediterranean destinations preferred by travelers from the same markets. Issues confronting tourism \nDespite announcing encouraging figures for the 2018 tourism season in Greece, SETE\u2019s president referred to issues that may possibility lead to a decline in Greece\u2019s tourism numbers in the coming years. \n\u201cIf the issues that we are constantly referring to \u2014 tourism investments, spatial planning and overtaxation \u2014 are not dealt with (by the government) within the next 18 to 24 months, then we will see an impact on our tourism activity in the coming years,\u201d Retsos stressed. \nHe also referred to the rise in popularity this year of competitor destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, which faced problems in previous years. \nIn regards to talk about geopolitical developments affecting Greece\u2019s tourism progress, Retsos said that \u201cextreme statements\u201d on the issue should be avoided. \u201cThis is a huge issue worldwide and something that is beyond our control\u2026 What we have to do is continue to do our job well and improve our offered services,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAny talk about geopolitics just creates anxiety, without actually leading to any result,\u201d he added. \nReferring to SETE\u2019s aims for Greek tourism, Retsos said the confederation\u2019s strategy includes strengthening ties with Brussels , following its recent visit to the European Commission in February.

Their dust emissions have exceeded \"harmful\" levels in the capital since last month. \nPM2.5 is a major concern as these particles are smaller than the width of a single human hair and bury deep inside the lungs, causing serious respiratory problems. \nThey can also \"enter veins and instigate some [negative] reactions\" causing high blood pressure and deep vein thrombosis, Disease Control Department chief Suwanchai Watthanayingcharoenchai warned Friday. \nThese conditions can lead to coronary artery disease, strokes and, in the long term, become a precursor to cancer. \nCars, mostly with diesel-powered engines, and factories contribute 52% of the pollutants in the capital, followed by 35% from outdoor burning, Mr Supat said. The rest is brought on by freak weather conditions and other sources. \nMr Supat, an air environment expert and Thammasat University lecturer, insisted Bangkok must limit the number of lorries in city areas and better cope with poorly managed traffic congestion, fuelled by the increasing number of vehicles. \nHe suggested authorities adopt a three-month measure, from February to April every year, to extend areas where lorries are allowed to run only during certain hours. \nPM2.5 levels often peak during the dry season, especially in the first few months of the year. \nIf the measure fails to curb dust levels, officials should intensify vehicle controls to cover small trucks during rush hours and even private cars. The latter with even, or odd, number plates should be barred from some city roads on alternate days, he said. \nThe ultimate solution would see a complete ban on outdoor burning especially in Bangkok's suburbs and neighbouring provinces, pundits say. \nMr Supat said more drastic efforts would be needed in the future to improve the traffic flow and better control emissions from construction sites in the capital. \nSome have called to ban temple crematoria that emit smoke.

Veterinarians will take swift action against any other infected animals found in the area, and those suspected of infection, to control the disease. \nMr Jeerasak said the dog was hit by a vehicle in Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan on March 4 and an animal lover took it for treatment. The dog was then taken to the house on March 15. \nIt became aggressive on March 17 and bit a local resident. The dog was taken to a clinic on Monday and died on Tuesday. A test confirmed it was infected with rabies. There were four more dogs at the same house. \nRabies control zones remained in place in 25 provinces on Friday.

Known for his unapologetic political and social commentary, one should be prepared to be shocked by his colourful yet graphic works that communicate his social responsibility towards the community and the nation. With sarcasm, satire and implicit comparisons, this may be one of the most controversial exhibitions the BACC has ever hosted. \"I Am You\" is a retrospective from the artists' works from 1975 to the present day, split into five topics: \"Ideals And Ideology\", \"Powerful Vs Powerless\", \"Raw Aesthetic As A Weapon\", \"Face, Figure and Liberty\", and \"Protest And Making The World A Better Place\". In this political climate, we'll have to see if the exhibition will even last the week. \"I Am You\" is exhibited on the 8th Floor, BACC, until May 27, 2018. For more information, go to bacc.or.th.

(Reuters file photo) - + FUKUSHIMA, Japan: Fishery workers in Fukushima were shocked and saddened after an event serving fish from the northeastern Japan prefecture was cancelled in Bangkok earlier this month due to strong opposition from a local consumer group. The cancellation, made despite the fish having obtained Thai health authorities' safety approval, highlights the difficulty faced by the region in convincing consumers about the safety of its food products even seven years after it was devastated by the 2011 killer tsunami and ensuing nuclear disaster. \"I felt like I was pushed down the stairs,\" said Kanji Tachiya, a fishery cooperative official in the prefecture, referring to his feelings when learning about the news from Bangkok. A dish using flatfish from Fukushima, a local specialty, was supposed to be served at 11 Japanese restaurants in the Thai capital from March 10 through the end of the month in an event that would have boosted the morale of fishermen and helped Fukushima rebuild its reputation. The prefectural government had spent a year and a half preparing for the event, including inviting chefs and restaurant owners in Bangkok to a fishing port in Soma, Fukushima, to see the quality of the fish and how rigidly radiation checks are conducted. \"We are confident about the safety of our fish,\" Tachiya said. At the port, a catch of fish undergoes radiation checks with strict safety standards set by the Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations. While the Japanese government has set a maximum limit for radioactive cesium in sea produce and other food items of 100 becquerels per kilogramme, which it says is stricter than international standards, the upper limit set by the Fukushima fisheries group is 50 becquerels per kg. If fish is found to contain radioactive cesium exceeding the 50 becquerel-limit, the catch will not be shipped to market. \"We are spending time and effort on the tests. I'm very sad that the scare (about the fish) continues even though its safety is confirmed,\" said a female worker who slices fish for radiation checks. Fukushima shipped flatfish to Thailand for the aborted event, marking the first export of local fresh fish since meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"We can't just give up. We will tenaciously keep telling people of the safety and tastiness (of the local fish),\" said Takahiro Ichimura, an official of the prefectural government. The prefecture is now considering inviting Thai journalists to Fukushima so they can learn about the local fishing and radiation tests at first hand. Thailand has been the largest overseas purchaser of Fukushima fruit, including peaches and persimmons, and the prefecture has held promotional events every year in the country. While there has been no negative response to the events promoting fruit from Fukushima, officials are concerned that the cancellation of the fish-serving event could have a negative impact on fruit exports to the kingdom.

The group's industrial unit, located in Bangplee will be an investment of EUR47.4 million for the company. \nIts offices and production center together employ more than 700 staff and manufacture products for two of its brands, NIVEA and Eucerin, for the Thai market and export to 43 other countries. This expansion is reflective of the continued growth this cosmetics giant has enjoyed within the region. \nMr. Markus Daburger, Beiersdorf Thailand says: \"The Pailin Project is Beiersdorf's commitment towards doubling production performance in order to support the demand of the region. As a representative of Beiersdorf Thailand, we appreciate the on-going support of the Government and local agencies in our expansion project, which not only sees the production line expand, but also our Beiersdorf family, as up to 200 jobs new will be created in the next years. We are proud to say that the Pailin Project in Thailand is now the second biggest hub of the company after Germany.\" \nA key target of the project is to improve the working environment for all employees, with cutting-edge innovation, structured offices, optimized work ergonomics and CE-standard machines as well as a refurbishment of the existing production building. The compounding area will be renewed with four mixers replaced while the factory entrance, canteen, offices and recreation area will all be refurbished, too. \nEfficiency is also a key consideration. Line performance will be improved to see production peak at 240 bottles per minute on a single line. The expansion will include a solar-paneled roof with the capability to produce 500kW of power, and is on target to achieve a gold LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) certification. The U.S Green Building Council's prestigious certification serves as a project management tool to achieve more sustainable, high-performance green buildings. \nThe expansion, due to house new production lines for Deo Roll-Ons, has a building footprint dimension of 72m x 97m and a construction area of 9,679m2. This vast project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2019 and will begin production of Roll-Ons in the following quarter. The existing building will be refurbished to accommodate Lip Care production which will begin in the middle of 2020.

With former Top Chef contestant Melissa Herrera at the helm, magnificent gastronomic aesthetics come as no surprise. If that isn\u2019t enough to convince you to visit, Valmas\u2019s menu-less concept remains an intriguing enigma. Try the Eixample-based restaurant to experience Instagram-worthy tapas with a twist. \nLike many venues in the Catalan capital, an unassuming exterior hides a carefully designed, cosy interior. Rustic rock walls are offset by contemporary artwork and plants decorated with fairy lights, which provide a romantic, twilight ambience. The dining area is separated into semi-separated sections by dividing walls which add to the intimacy of the setting. Once seated however, instead of choosing what to eat, everyone is treated to Herrera\u2019s daily tasting menu \u2013 a multi-course selection, heavily dependant upon what products are sourced from the local market that day. Simply inform your waiter of any dietary requirements and wait for each surprise to arrive at leisure. \nTraditional Mediterranean recipes are at the foundation of Valmas\u2019 cuisine, but each one is heavily influenced by Herrera\u2019s creativity. Even the crusty bread accompaniment, a staple of every Continental meal, arrives with miniature pipettes for depositing olive oil. Seafood features strongly throughout the meal, and includes raw dishes such as salmon tataki with delicate garnishing and violet decorations. Clams, steamed and then served in an onion-based soup, is another main course already popular with locals and tourists alike. Herrera also demonstrates her cheffing proficiency with her lightly seared beef steaks, which are served in a mysterious black box with sauteed mushroom caps. \nFor visitors to Barcelona, Valmas is worth you venturing away from the tourist-orientated heart of the city to the beautiful Eixample district for either dinner or lunch. The appearance of the food is sublime, and each course provides unmissable photo opportunities. Moreover, the trust you place in the chef by allowing her to design your meal adds a unique dynamic that breaks the boundaries of traditional dining.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "herrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valmas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa herrera", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valmas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:08:29.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66e14e6d9706dd904fa851461d1daceca32bb44d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS68cYw4uBEa.GTAFlMhtupv7HYUTwvQf.8ebwC.IHuYaDFVT1lRXkff4PhXCp8LdOHKw5UzLjNEA--", "site_full": "www.edicionessibila.com", "site": "edicionessibila.com", "site_section": "http://www.edicionessibila.com/rss.php?idseccion=8645", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "Ediciones Sibila", "title": "El webrooming se impone al showrooming, seg\u00fan el \u00faltimo and #8203;Informe BIG DATA sobre el comportamiento del consumidor 2017 en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas de TC Group Solutions", "title_full": "El webrooming se impone al showrooming, seg\u00fan el \u00faltimo and #8203;Informe BIG DATA sobre el comportamiento del consumidor 2017 en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas de TC Group Solutions", "published": "2018-03-23T01:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66e14e6d9706dd904fa851461d1daceca32bb44d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS68cYw4uBEa.GTAFlMhtupv7HYUTwvQf.8ebwC.IHuYaDFVT1lRXkff4PhXCp8LdOHKw5UzLjNEA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T01:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "El webrooming se impone al showrooming, seg\u00fan el \u00faltimo and #8203;Informe BIG DATA sobre el comportamiento del consumidor 2017 en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas de TC Group Solutions", "text": "< Volver 23 de Marzo de 2018 \u200bInforme BIG DATA sobre el comportamiento del consumidor 2017 en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas de TC Group Solutions \u00b7 El Black Friday se consolida en todo el pa\u00eds, con un aumento medio del 11% de tr\u00e1fico peatonal a lo largo de toda semana. \u00b7 Madrid desplaza a Barcelona como capital de la moda en 2017. \u00e1reas y calles comerciales del pa\u00eds trav\u00e9s de su flujo de peatones, los d\u00edas y horas de m\u00e1s y menos afluencia, o el coste por cliente potencial derivado del precio de alquiler inmobiliario, a la vez que analiza el comportamiento de este consumidor omnicanal para detectar nuevas tendencias.Este tercer Informe sobre el comportamiento del consumidor en las calles comerciales Espa\u00f1olas se present\u00f3 ayer 21 de marzo en Madrid en el marco del Retail F\u00f3rum por los representantes de la empresa y el Prof. Dr. Carles Torrecilla, Doctor en Comercializaci\u00f3n e Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados y Profesor titular del Departamento de Direcci\u00f3n de Marketing de ESADE, quien hizo la conferencia inaugural \"Fiebre (comercial) y term\u00f3metros digitales\". Seg\u00fan Marta Fern\u00e1ndez Melgarejo, directora de Marketing de TC Group Solutions y responsable del estudio, \u201cel webrooming se impone al showrooming en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas\u201d. 2017 ha sido un a\u00f1o de bajada generalizada en la tasa de atracci\u00f3n comercial, con decrementos en los porcentajes de entradas a las tiendas que van desde los 1,5 puntos (Barcelona) a los 0,5 puntos (ciudades del Grupo III). En cambio, en todas las ciudades analizadas, ha aumentado favorablemente la tasa de conversi\u00f3n a ventas: entre los 3,6 puntos (Madrid) y los 0,3 puntos (ciudades del Grupo III). Menos visitantes pero, a la vez, m\u00e1s dispuestos a efectuar su compra en la tienda f\u00edsica en lugar de deambular por la tienda evaluando los productos y acabar saliendo con las manos vac\u00edas.El comportamiento del consumidor es el de practicar menos showrooming (visitar las tiendas f\u00edsicas para evaluar un producto que finalmente se acaba adquiriendo online) y m\u00e1s webrooming (cuando se analiza el producto en la red pero se realiza la compra en la tienda f\u00edsica). El informe se\u00f1ala que en Espa\u00f1a, el 37,6% de los clientes que entran en una tienda a pie de calle acaba comprando algo.El mensaje de la conferencia del Dr. Carles Torrecilla fue claro: \u201csolo cruzando los datos del mundo online con los del mundo offline podr\u00e1, el retailer offline, convertir la amenaza en oportunidad y competir, o convivir, con el mundo online en igualdad de condiciones.\u201d Pero, por otro lado, Torrecilla tambi\u00e9n hizo hincapi\u00e9 en que \u201ctanto dato e informaci\u00f3n hace que adem\u00e1s debamos poner especial atenci\u00f3n a la legalidad de la recogida, almacenaje y tratamiento de la informaci\u00f3n, por lo que debemos estar muy atentos a que nuestros proveedores de servicios cumplan con la legislaci\u00f3n en continua evoluci\u00f3n.\u201d La segunda conclusi\u00f3n que se extrae del estudio de este a\u00f1o 2017, es que \u201cel Black Friday\u201d llega a Espa\u00f1a para quedarse\u201d. La jornada de grandes descuentos Black Friday se ha convertido en una semana de aumento de tr\u00e1fico peatonal en las calles Comerciales espa\u00f1olas, con un aumento medio del 11% evidenciando que, cada vez m\u00e1s, los espa\u00f1oles aprovechan para concentrar sus compras pendientes e incluso avanzar los regalos de Navidad.En Madrid, el Black Friday fue el d\u00eda de m\u00e1s tr\u00e1fico peatonal del a\u00f1o 2017 en con una media de 7.891 transe\u00fantes en sus principales v\u00edas comerciales.La jornada de descuentos super\u00f3 en afluencia al periodo navide\u00f1o de a\u00f1os anteriores. Sin embargo, la cifra registrada fue menor a la de 2016, cuando el lunes 4 de enero se lleg\u00f3 a los 8.047 peatones. Otro mensaje extra\u00eddo de la presentaci\u00f3n de este estudio es la importancia de conocer el Coste por Cliente Potencial. Este indicador (CCP) combina el tr\u00e1fico medio de la calle con la renta media de alquiler de los locales comerciales de la misma, ofreciendo como resultado un valor en euros por cada cliente potencial que pasa frente al escaparate de una tienda ubicada en dicha calle.Esta edici\u00f3n, el informe ha escogido la calle Fuencarral en Madrid, para analizarla en profundidad, junto a las calles Pelayo (Barcelona), Tetu\u00e1n (Sevilla) y Jaime III (Palma de Mallorca).En la calle Fuencarral, un espacio comercial de 80 m2 est\u00e1 pagando 4,14 c\u00e9ntimos de euro por cliente potencial, frente a los 2,7 c\u00e9ntimos de euro que costar\u00eda la calle Pelayo de Barcelona, los 2,58 c\u00e9ntimos que pagar\u00eda en la calle Tetu\u00e1n de Sevilla o los 3,9 en Jaime III de Palma de Mallorca.Finalmente, el Estudio, que agrega todos los sectores de la distribuci\u00f3n (a excepci\u00f3n de supermercados, restauraci\u00f3n y estaciones de servicio, dado que el comportamiento de los consumidores es claramente distinto), dedica un cap\u00edtulo completo a estudiar por separado el comportamiento del consumidor de moda, entendiendo como moda las tiendas de ropa, calzado y complementos. Este consumidor, que en los dos \u00faltimos estudios protagonizaba el mercado barcelon\u00e9s, se ha desplazado a Madrid como capital de la moda. La media de clientes diarios de una tienda a pie de calle del sector moda, en Madrid, es de 154, 28 m\u00e1s que en Barcelona, 59 m\u00e1s que en las ciudades del Grupo II y 82 m\u00e1s que en las del Grupo III. Contenido del informe El tercer Informe Big Data sobre el Comportamiento del Consumidor se ha realizado a partir de los millones de datos recopilados por los sensores inteligentes instalados en las calles comerciales de toda Espa\u00f1a, junto con las miles de entradas de clientes y las transacciones que se realizan diariamente en los puntos de venta, siempre almacenados y tratados de manera an\u00f3nima, agregada y acorde con la legislaci\u00f3n vigente.Estructurado en cuatro cap\u00edtulos, en el primero presenta el comportamiento del tr\u00e1fico peatonal (por d\u00f3nde se mueve, qu\u00e9 d\u00edas de la semana, a qu\u00e9 horas\u2026) de las calles comerciales de Espa\u00f1a, clasificadas en tres grupos de ciudades:\u2014 Grupo I: metr\u00f3polis nacionales de m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de habitantes, Barcelona y Madrid, estudiadas por separado.\u2014 Grupo II: metr\u00f3polis regionales de primer orden, de 300.000 a un mill\u00f3n de habitantes, estudiadas de forma agregada (Valencia, Sevilla, Bilbao, Zaragoza y M\u00e1laga).\u2014 Grupo III: metr\u00f3polis regionales de segundo orden (200.000-300.000 habitantes), tambi\u00e9n estudiadas en conjunto: La Coru\u00f1a, Vigo, Oviedo, Santander, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Pamplona, Valladolid, Salamanca, Alicante, Murcia, C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00e1diz, Granada, Palma de Mallorca, Tenerife y Las Palmas.En el segundo cap\u00edtulo se toma una calle representativa de cada grupo para analizarla en profundidad, a lo que han denominado radiograf\u00edas: la evoluci\u00f3n del tr\u00e1fico y afluencia seg\u00fan las horas del d\u00eda y los d\u00edas de la semana, los precios de alquiler de los locales comerciales y, en consecuencia, el coste por cliente potencial de cada una.El tercer cap\u00edtulo compara los ratios de atracci\u00f3n y de conversi\u00f3n de las distintas ciudades, es decir, cu\u00e1ntos de estos transe\u00fantes est\u00e1n de paso y cu\u00e1ntos realmente entran en las tiendas con alguna intenci\u00f3n de compra o curiosidad y cu\u00e1ntos de ellos efect\u00faan alguna compra o salen con las manos vac\u00edas.Finalmente, el \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo estudia por separado el sector moda, entendiendo como moda las tiendas de ropa, calzado y complementos. Los anteriores cap\u00edtulos incluyen todos los sectores de la distribuci\u00f3n, a excepci\u00f3n de supermercados, restauraci\u00f3n y estaciones de servicio, puesto que el comportamiento de los consumidores es claramente distinto.

Tantarantana is one of these rare gems, a traditional Spanish eatery where you are guaranteed top-quality tapas every time you visit. Popular with locals as well as with in-the-know tourists, Tantarantana will quickly become a family favourite, and one worth returning to Barcelona for. \nThe picturesque El Born neighbourhood is home to the emblematic restaurant, a peaceful area on the edge of the famous Parc de la Ciutadella. Boasting not one but two al fresco dining areas, the restaurant extends between the charming Pla\u00e7a de Pons i Clerch on one side, and the leafy Carrer de l\u2019Allada-Vermell on the other. Inside, a rustic, cosy interior of stone walls and black and white photographs welcomes patrons, and you can opt to sit downstairs alongside the bar, or upstairs in their open dining area. Whatever your preference, make sure to book a table in advance as this beloved spot tends to fill up daily. \nIn traditional Spanish style, Tantarantana\u2019s ingredients are market-sourced and include only the freshest produce. As a result, even typical local fare such as their golden patatas bravas and batter-fried calamari are of superior taste and a cut above what is found in Barcelona\u2019s many tourist traps. For vegetarians and the health-conscious, a selection of salads is on offer, from a beluga lentil dish with spinach, feta and candied onion, to the city\u2019s creamiest burrata cheese, served with juicy tomatoes and citrus infused rocket leaves. Also suitable for herbivores, the mushroom risotto with truffled ceps is a surprisingly light option, absolutely bursting with flavour. \n\nAlthough the menu is divided between tapas dishes and larger plates, it is recommended to order main courses to share in order to try a more diverse sample of Tantaranata\u2019s first-rate gastronomy. In this way, you can discover their roast chicken croquettes, overflowing with creamy b\u00e9chamel, their succulent confited cod with ratatouille, and the unmissable 200g of ecological Pyrenees beef. Many options are also available for those who have yet to become accustomed to the Mediterranean diet. For instance, their mini burgers are an original take on their oversized American cousins, and perfectly complement the \u2018dashed\u2019 fried eggs, which are mixed with homemade chips and pieces of Iberian ham. \nFinally, Tantarantana proves its superiority once more with their dessert menu. This stage of the meal can make or break an experience but thanks to their broad selection and the fact they are all homemade, you can rest assured that your choice will be a winner.

National flags of China and India welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Beijing in 2015. Photo: VCG \n\"Creditor Imperialism\" has become a new catchphrase created by India to beef up the so-called \"China threat,\" accusing China of \"using sovereign debt to bend other states to its will, without having to fire a single shot.\"Such rhetoric, typically orchestrated by Western elites, is now India's new weapon to attack China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in an attempt to influence public opinion on Chinese international strategy. Given that China's BRI is becoming increasingly popular, India is leading a new round of hype among global media with multiple versions of the \"China threat theory.\"Brahma Chellaney, an Indian expert from New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, created the new phrase, \"China's creditor imperialism,\" in the end of 2017 to attack China's BRI. In his article, the Indian expert blames China for using BRI to engage in \"Creditor Imperialism,\" by shackling participating states and forcing its partners to hand over domestic resources to repay debts. The claim was shrugged off by Chinese netizens and scholars. \"Again, it is no surprise to hear such accusations against the BRI. I think those economies who truly participated in it and get the tangible benefits from it would be the best people to respond their query,\" read a comment on Chinese social media Sina Weibo, which received the most thumbs up.\"How interesting it is to hear that so-called 'imperialism,' the patent of America, is now taken over by China. We feel rather proud, don't we?\" read another comment.Seeing the absurdity in India's updated China threat theory, Wang Wen, executive dean of Renmin University of China's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, believes that the \"debt cordon\" that was used to describe EU countries, as referred by Chellaney, is not suitable for measuring the debt status of emerging economies, stressing complementary advantages and mutual development between China and the countries joining the Belt and Road Initiative.The BRI is a transparent initiative that follows the \"golden rule\" of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference during this year's two sessions. \"It is time to lay the 'China threat theory' to rest,\" Wang said later, calling on China to shrug off the accusation during this year's two sessions. \"As China grows, the 'China collapse theory' has collapsed and become an international joke. The 'China threat theory,' with its various sensational versions, is losing steam,\" said Wang.\"Those who do not have bias or practice double standards will see in China not a threat, but plenty of opportunities,\" Wang Yi added. \nMutually benefited partnership In the Indian expert's editorial piece, he draws on the case of Sri Lanka's Hambantota port as assertive evidence of so-called \"debt bondage\" attached to projects of the BRI at the cost of losing its sovereignty.\"As Sri Lanka's handover of the strategic Hambantota port shows, states caught in debt bondage to the new imperial giant risk losing both natural assets and their very sovereignty,\" wrote the piece.Chellaney depicted China's tactic of \"imperialism\" as providing the financial largesse - the huge-project-related loans - to those partnerships caught in capital crisis in exchange for key strategic resources. Chellaney refers to it as a new type of exploitative debtor relationships.Unscrambling the accusation, Wang Wen revealed that the claim attempted to arouse memories of new colonialism after the World War II, drawing a connection between China and the plundering of resources by some Western countries in African and Asian countries.\"Taking Sri Lanka for instance, China's 99-year lease on land is subject to Sri Lanka's general rule equal for any other global companies. Sri Lanka can find a balance in maintaining sustainable economic growth and repaying the debt. It's fair to say that the project is a good example of complementary advantages and mutual development,\" wrote Wang in a commentary published in the Global Times. Sun Shihai, an expert on Sino-Indian relations from Sichuan University, also stressed the principle of \"mutual benefit\" underlined in the BRI project. \"The participation of many countries is an absolutely voluntary process but not China's imposed scheme,\" Sun told the Global Times. \"It is unfair to label China as an imperialist, as we neither robbed any resources from our partners nor colonized their lands. We have not any intention to destruct others' sovereignty.\" Keeping vigilant But such explanations hardly dispel misgiving of some Indian experts that Beijing will dictate the terms of engagement in the Belt and Road Initiative.\"Despite the fact that Beijing often says that the success of the Initiative will depend on a partnership with participating countries, this partnership remains unequal and gives rise to questions about the direction of Beijing's economic policies and ability to control these economies,\" Professor Madhu Bhalla, an expert in Sino-Indian relations from the Department of East Asian Studies of Delhi University, told Global Times.But she denied that the fears are unique to China, and rather that \"major economies have also been voiced in relation to other dominated economies\" in earlier centuries, such as the control and exploitation by EU in Africa. \"In India, given our history of colonial exploitation of natural resources and national wealth, there will always be questions about neo-colonial control of local economies through creating indebtedness and swapping of natural resources in exchange for payments,\" Bhalla continued.\"Frenemy,\" a portmanteau of friend and enemy, is an accurate way to describe India's current mentality toward China. India regards the Sino-Indian relationship as a significant part of its neighborhood diplomacy, but sprinkled with some fear and vigilance.While New Delhi promises to strengthen strategic mutual trust with Beijing, it repeatedly commits acts underlining indifference and skepticism about the Belt and Road Initiative, which jeopardizes bilateral ties. \"BRI is essentially an imperial project\u2026states caught in debt bondage to China risk losing both their most valuable natural assets and their very sovereignty,\" as Brahma Chellaney defined China's Belt and Road Initiative.India reportedly derived its potential concerns around the geopolitical threat they believe is attached to China's Belt and Road Initiative.Wang Yizhi, a professor in international relations at Renmin University of China, noted that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is believed to be one of the key factors to cause Delhi's hesitation against the initiative. The corridor runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which is considered by India to be Indian territory.Furthermore, \"China's relations with India's neighbors (Pakistan to the north, Bangladesh and Burma to the east, and Sri Lanka to the south) makes New Delhi cautious to be alienated and lose its influence in strategically important areas,\" Sun noted. Even though the Indian government has never endorsed the term \"Chinese Creditor Imperialism,\" there is much interest in how Chinese investments are being made in the Indian Ocean Littoral and elsewhere, according to Bhalla. \"India has a legitimate interest in healthy economic growth in its neighborhood, given that failed economies generally lead to intra- and inter-state conflict in the region as elsewhere. Hence its interest, and the interest of its strategic community in the future of regional economies, especially given the rising graph of indebtedness with Chinese investments, have become of some concern within these economies,\" said Bhalla. Refutation of BRI countries Similar fears have also been announced by American former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his recent trip to Africa, when he claimed China is entrapping African governments with \"opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt\" with the Belt and Road project.Some African top diplomats later responded against Tillerson's accusations. Augustine Mahiga, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tanzania, stressed the participating country's autonomy and their right sense of judgment in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. Mahiga said he is confident that, with many options for African countries to seek financing in international capital markets, Africa has sufficient freedom and capacity to compare and accept loans that meet their own needs. Abebe Aynete, a senior researcher at Ehiopian Foreign Relations Strategic Studies Institute, argues that China's investment in infrastructure projects along the BRI plan have brought about changes in African countries that are \"plain to see,\" as reported by Xinhua News Agency.Chinese investment in African countries has largely improved the livelihood of locals, including improved living conditions, creating jobs and training workers, which has won praise from the people and governments alike.\"The Chinese investment in Africa focuses on infrastructure, while the United States for a long time has focused on promoting its own values. The choice is for Africans to decide who is a better partner,\" said Aynete.In response to concerns, Wang Wen calls for more transparency in reviewing BRI projects, which he regards not only as an encouragement for Chinese firms, but also a powerful response to unfriendly insults and skepticisms from global society.\"In the face of the continued smears and slander, China has to prepare psychologically and strategically to push ahead,\" Wang concluded.Global Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global times", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vcg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T08:19:42.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb218a8dd5df99cdca2850deebf5be04160e787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEs9JvipnwLBEu3gtHSBgzlX1U1HWZAHwAWv3UC973JpD", "site_full": "www.globaltimes.cn", "site": "globaltimes.cn", "site_section": "http://www.globaltimes.cn/rss/outbrain.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "outbrain", "title": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "title_full": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "published": "2018-03-22T20:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2714, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb218a8dd5df99cdca2850deebf5be04160e787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEs9JvipnwLBEu3gtHSBgzlX1U1HWZAHwAWv3UC973JpD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T20:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival", "text": "Feminism and #MeToo take center stage as French author Le\u00efla Slimani comes to Beijing for Francophonie Festival By He Keyao Source:Global Times   18:08:39 Le\u00efla Slimani (left) and Hong Huang address the issue of gender equality at a forum in Beijing on March 8. Photo: He Keyao/GT \nContrary to common misunderstandings, feminism is not an \"anti-male\" agenda, but a movement concerned with improving the lives of women and creating a more equal world for both genders. That was the strong message that a celebrated French female writer and an influential Chinese publisher delivered to the Chinese public earlier this month at an event for the ongoing Francophonie Festival in China. Amid the storm of worldwide feminist movements fueled by #MeToo, discussions and thoughts about women's social status and feminism featured prominently during a town hall talk on March 8 with award-winning French writer Le\u00efla Slimani, the youngest winner of the Prix Goncourt award for her 2016 novel Chanson Douce . The most read book in France that year, its Chinese translation has a large readership in ChinaSitting down with celebrated Chinese publisher and columnist Hong Huang, Slimani shared her experiences and thoughts on the lives of women in modern society and the true meaning of feminism. A universal problem \"The very question of asking a woman how to keep a balance between her work and her family reflects gender inequality because no one asks a man about that,\" Slimani said when asked about how she manages to be a mother with a successful career. That problematic idea that women who focus more on their career than having and raising kids are selfish and irresponsible is still very common in many places today, according to Slimani, and this has led to women struggling with becoming the \"perfect woman\" who can handle both work and home equally well. \"Maybe it's time to admit that we cannot do both that well and men need to share more work at home,\" said Slimani. According to her observations, women are often paid less than men in France, which results in women having a lower economic status in the family. This then pushes many of them to become housewives or to shoulder more responsibility in the household and thus reinforces traditional stereotypes in what is a vicious circle. However, Chinese counterparts seem to be less affected by this vicious circle when it comes to career and economic status within the family. According to 2017 statistics from sohu.com, a web portal in China, nearly 70 percent of women of working age are employed in China while in France this number sits around 62 percent, followed by 60 percent in New Zealand and 58 percent in the US. Moreover, the 2018 Hurun List of Self-Made Women Billionaires shows that 62 out of the 102 listed entrepreneurs are from China, with Beijing being home to the highest number of the world's wealthiest women. \"I have to say that in China women's social status is based more on their economic power, rather than gender. Rich women are not likely to be treated any differently than men,\" noted Hong, adding that it is often women living in poverty that suffer the most from gender discrimination and therefore \"economic independence\" is the key to improving women's social positions. Complicated social and historical factors lie behind women's rising position in China. A nationwide campaign encouraging women to work outside the home took place in the 1950s and the slogan \"women hold up half the sky,\" proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong, spread like wildfire through the country. Public education of gender equality, marriage laws and the one-child policy also helped boost the social status of Chinese women. However, when it comes to house chores and childcare, women are still the major force in China as the perception of a good mother and hardworking wife for women is difficult to change. Statistics from sohu.com shows that in 62 percent of households women outwork men at home, while in 20 percent of families women do all the household chores. The pressure to be both a good wife and a qualified employee has led to many Chinese women complaining on social media that they are the \"hardest working people\" in China. \"The problem is universal here and overseas. Women should not feel guilty for pursing their own development. Sometimes we cannot do both, and that is fine,\" said Hong. For women, not 'against men' As the #MeToo movement continues to spread worldwide, some counterproductive behavior has cropped up here and there. In South Korea, a sense of \"gynephobia\" is on the rise as some men have begun to deliberately avoid their female colleagues, worrying that the latter might file complaints about their behavior, according to a report by South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. Experts say that this practice only leads to new disadvantages for women at the workplace, as it puts the two genders at odds with each other. Regarding this \"gynephobia,\" both Slimani and Hong emphasized that feminism is not \"against men,\" but rather is about doing more to protect women and ensure they are treated equally. \"Feminism should be a humanistic concern that protects women's basic rights. I'm not against anyone,\" said Slimani. She indicated that #Metoo is about making women's voices heard, not about causing women and men to become enemies. Both genders should be treated equally. Hong noted that the word \"feminism\" is often misused in Chinese society. \"I think the word is demonized in China. It should be about gender equality and giving women a voice, rather than anything else,\" Hong said. She pointed out that some people in China who tout the idea of feminism are just using it as a guise to take advantage of men. The practice of women requiring men own apartments and cars before being willing to tie the knot is one such example. This type of \"bad feminism,\" which Hong noted has nothing to do with feminism at all, is so common that the slang term wein\u00fcquan zhuyi , or \"fake feminism\" has arisen on social media in China to describe the phenomenon.

Tsinghua University said on the same day it would recruit 15 students from both senior grade two and senior grade three students. \nThe two schools said their selections would take into consideration the students' natural talent in math, comprehensive learning ability, and psychological tests. \nIn addition to the schools' independent enrollment tests, the candidates must sit the national college entrance exam and their scores should exceed the enrollment level for China's first-class universities. \nSun Zhaojun, deputy Party chief of the Mathematic Science Institute of Peking University, said most world-renown mathematicians achieved their major achievements at the ages between 18 and 40. Those who received the Fields Medal, an international medal for outstanding discoveries in mathematics, were all aged under 40. \nPeking University hopes the elite math class can foster a group of Chinese mathematicians who will make international achievements. The development of the subject is the foundation of many math-related applications. \n\"Skilled math students show their talent and passion at an early age. Tsinghua's elite class will invite international mathematicians to teach, so as to encourage the young students' full potential,\" said Zou Wenming, dean of the Mathematics Department of Tsinghua.

That is a very tight timeline, so we do have to move forward fast\" both in terms of technology and regulations, Zeng told the Global Times on Thursday. \nWidely accepted standards divide autonomous driving into five levels. Level 3 cars are capable of taking full control when certain conditions are met, while level 5 cars can operate itself in all conditions. \nChina has listed autonomous driving as a key sector under the broad \"Made in China 2025\" initiative that aims to transfer China into a manufacturing powerhouse of advanced products. Baidu has been included in a list of artificial intelligence (AI) industry leaders, known as China's AI national team, by the Ministry of Science and Technology. \n\"To meet these goals, we have a lot of catching-up to do because we are already four to five years behind the U.S. in open road tests,\" Zeng said. \nHowever, some experts said that after a pedestrian was killed by a self-driving car operated by ride-hailing services provider Uber in a test in Arizona on March 18, US regulations could be tightened for road tests. \nAfter the accident, Boston put its self-driving car testing program on hold and started to review regulations. \nSome media reports have suggested that the tightening U.S. regulations over self-driving car tests could give China a chance to catch up in an increasingly heated competition between the countries. \nBut experts said that the regulatory changes would not slow the U.S.' effort in self-driving car development and that Chinese companies still have a way to go to catch up. \nWang Xin, who runs an influential online auto news site known as Auto Prophet, said that some Chinese companies such as Baidu are still adding self-driving features to traditional vehicles, while self-driving cars could be a whole new concept in mobile solutions. \n\"At the moment, the idea of self-driving cars is about putting sensors and cameras on top of a traditional car. They just want to make money in the car industry\u2026 that's meaningless,\" Wang told the Global Times Thursday. \"The core of autonomous driving is not about cars.\" Related news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "li yan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "download  baidu inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baidu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:24:32.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "351bca2e60b31014f750344bfbf39526f3a8cdd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhoUfKj5XBIB0e93bAiGSp1MjxR8ZLyPDFUD0qTpO7g_T", "site_full": "www.ecns.cn", "site": "ecns.cn", "site_section": "http://www.ecns.cn/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "ecns", "title": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "title_full": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "published": "2018-03-24T01:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11991, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "351bca2e60b31014f750344bfbf39526f3a8cdd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhoUfKj5XBIB0e93bAiGSp1MjxR8ZLyPDFUD0qTpO7g_T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T01:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission", "text": "China inaugurates national supervisory commission 1 2018-03-24 09:17 Xinhua Editor: Wang Fan ECNS App Download Zhao Leji (L), member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), attends the inauguration ceremony of China's national supervisory commission in Beijing, capital of China, March 23, 2018. (Xinhua/Li Tao) \nChina's national supervisory commission was officially inaugurated Friday when the newly appointed deputy directors and members of the commission took an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. \nZhao Leji, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), attended the ceremony. \nAt a meeting attended by the CCDI and national supervisory commission officials, Zhao called on the officials to faithfully perform their duties as stipulated in China's Constitution, the Supervision Law and the CPC Constitution to secure victory in the fight against corruption. \nZhao said that integration of function, personnel and work is the top priority for the CCDI and the national supervisory commission, who work together while keeping separate identities. \nZhao called for the commission to grasp the basic point of reform of the national supervisory system, stick to the CPC centralized and unified leadership, take a people-centered approach, and carry out supervision of all public posts. \nAnti-graft organs at all levels should improve self-supervision, he said. \nThe meeting was presided over by Yang Xiaodu, director of the national supervisory commission and deputy secretary of the CCDI.

According to a report by news agency PTI, the 29-year old will miss Afghanistan\u2019s historic Test debut in Bengaluru from June 14 and instead travel to south of London after the conclusion of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018 season. Should Kohli play in England, Ajinkya Rahane is believed to step in as skipper. \n\u201cVirat (Kohli) will be playing for a division one county side for sure. I wouldn\u2019t like to add anything more to it. There were talks with Surrey and Essex,\u201d a senior BCCI official was quoted as saying by PTI. \nThe decision to let Test specialists play in England was taken following India\u2019s 1-2 defeat against South Africa wher the team management admitted they should have prepared better for the series. \u201cThis time we have been pro-active because post the South Africa experience we felt that exposure was essential for the team,\u201d Vinod Rai, the chairman of the committee of administrators, the body governing the BCCI, told ESPNcricinfo . \u201cSo we have given him and other Test specialists permission to play in county cricket.\u201d \nRai further added that few pther Test spsecialists would be part of the India A squad, coached by Rahul Dravid , who will play two four-day matches in England in June. The decision was made in consultation with head coach Ravi Shastri, Dravid, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, and Saba Karim (BCCI\u2019s general manager of cricket) along with Kohli. \nThe report adds that the decision has been taken by the Indian captain in a bid to improve his batting in England, where he has not been able to perform at his best. Kohli has played five Tests in the country and has managed to score only 134 runs at an average of 13.4. If the reports are true, the right-hand batsman will become the first Indian to join Surrey, who have hosted some of the legends over the years. Virat Kohli \u2018s decision to play county cricket before the England series shows his drive and commitment to achieve excellence. I am sure not only him,but Team India will do exceedingly well in the England series. Best wishes! \n\u2014 VVS Laxman (@VVSLaxman281) March 24, 2018 \nThe report says that Kohli will make himself available for Surrey\u2019s three four-day matches against Hampshire, Somerset and Yorkshire between June 9 and June 28. Virat Kohli has made a strong statement of intent about the England tour where he has unfinished business by opting to play county cricket. In doing so, has also prioritised opposition by missing the test against Afghanistan \n\u2014 Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) 24 March 2018 \nHe will not be alone in playing county cricket to ready himself for the England tour. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishant Sharma , who went unsold this year at the IPL Auction, will also play the upcoming season of the county championship for Yorkshire and Sussex, respectively, starting April 7. \nREAD | Cheteshwar Pujara to play for Yorkshire in English County cricket \nSurrey\u2019s director and former England wicketkeeper Alec Stewart has shown keen interest in signing the prolific batsman. \u201cI did enquire a while back about Kohli when it appeared to be a possible option for him to play county cricket but was told India were playing Ireland in T20s and an inaugural Test against Afghanistan in June before the England tour. If he does now become available we would look at it again to see if it could potentially work around our current overseas arrangements,\u201d Stewart told The Telegraph . \nIndia are scheduled to play three T20Is, three ODIs and five Tests against England starting with the first T20I at Old Trafford in Manchester on July 3.

The epic thriller ended with Dinesh Karthik smashing a six in the final ball to win the trophy and the match for India. But it was not the first time the side had won a T20I against their neighbours on the final ball. In a similar match played a couple of years ago, it was allrounder Hardik Pandya who established himself as the hero after taking his side to victory. \nPlaying the do-or-die group stage match of the World T20 in 2016 at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, India went on to set a modest target of 148 for Bangladesh. Needing 11 of the final over, Pandya was tasked with defending the total. With Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim in the middle, it looked like an easy target to chase down. \nPandya pitched a wider delivery to Mahmudullah first-off which went for a single. Needing 10 off 5, Rahim launched the second delivery for a boundary reducing the equation to 6 off 4. He scooped the next ball for another boundary and the equation turned to 2 runs to win in 3 balls. Rahim tried to launch the next ball for a six but it went straight to Shikhar Dhawan . \nNeeding 2 off 2, Mahmudullah could not keep his calm and he too tried to play a big shot. But a diving catch from Ravindra Jadeja sent him back to the pavilion. With two wickets in two balls, Bangladesh\u2019s task had gone from a casual walk to a nervous nailbiter. With 2 runs to win on last delivery, India brought all their fielders inside the circle. Pandya pitched it short and wide and the Shuvagata Hom failed to connect. As Bangladesh tried to steal a single to take the match to a Super Over, MS Dhoni ran full speed to the stumps and took off the bails. As the replays showed the player was out of the crease, India went on to win the match by a run. \nWATCH VIDEO: #OnThisDay in 2016, India pulled off a dramatic one-run win over Bangladesh in a #WT20 group match in Bangalore.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hardik pandya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pandya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mushfiqur rahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinesh karthik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmudullah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinnaswamy stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:03:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfa700d8906ed242b1e38663f4e1a200fb42997e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTBC.nj9JzlDvcymwOUFCLODWiGxiXq3u9ATwpsnLPgC1O7ccTP4JqXqevwGJWktMv3Q4tQdiiyZX2GvUU7aLWAieI0T9lk8i0", "site_full": "www.thehindu.com", "site": "thehindu.com", "site_section": "http://www.thehindu.com/?service=rss#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Hindu - Home", "title": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "title_full": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "published": "2018-03-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/article23337289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGRUMAN", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 806, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 427, "comments": 0, "shares": 427}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfa700d8906ed242b1e38663f4e1a200fb42997e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTBC.nj9JzlDvcymwOUFCLODWiGxiXq3u9ATwpsnLPgC1O7ccTP4JqXqevwGJWktMv3Q4tQdiiyZX2GvUU7aLWAieI0T9lk8i0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff Reporter", "published": "2018-03-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Teen braves hip injury to appear for the exam", "text": "March 24, 2018 00:12   17:07 IST more-in Ruman Shariff wrote the paper with the help of a scribe \nRuman Shariff, 16, had to appear for his first language SSLC paper at a centre in Bengaluru while lying down on a mattress. \nThis is the only way as Ruman, a class 10 student of MES Kishore Kendra, met with an accident last month, after he completed his preparatory examination, and suffered a hip injury. \nThe school arranged for a scribe as he is unable to sit up for more than a few minutes. \n'Exam was easy' \n\u201cFriday\u2019s exam was easy.

The day I land in Bengaluru to spend a day with the players training at Sports Authority of India\u2019s (SAI) Centre of Excellence, there is only one stipulation from him: don\u2019t be late. \nWith the team of 30 that Singh is training to compete in the upcoming Commonwealth Games (CWG) in Gold Coast, Australia, punctuality, however, is never an issue. This has been his easiest outing yet, the coach admits. \u201cTheir focus is amazing. If the training is to start at 8 a.m., they are on the ground five minutes before time. If it ends at 10, they hang around for another 10 minutes, discussing the session,\u201d he says proudly. No looking back: Skills apart, the team has worked on building confidence and motivation. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nIt\u2019s all part of the dream the 30 women have together: to get into the top six in the world, to be counted as serious competitors, and win the big medals, starting with the CWG and going on to the World Cup and the Asian Games. More importantly, it\u2019s a fight for recognition, a desire to find their place in the sun, so long the preserve of the Indian men\u2019s hockey team. \nIt\u2019s attitude that sets the women apart from the men\u2019s side. Even though the intensity is as high, the men\u2019s training is often fun-filled. Not here, where even a minor game between two groups of trainees has the women going all out to outwit the opponent. \u201cWe all feel it is important to stay focussed. If it is a 60- or 90-minute training session, I don\u2019t see why anybody should have a problem concentrating completely on the game for that period of time. We are free the rest of the day anyway, right? Not that we don\u2019t have fun, especially when it is light training,\u201d says goalkeeper Savita Punia, one of the seniormost and key players in the side. \nThe team\u2019s scientific advisor, Wayne Lombard from South Africa, is proud of the work the women have put in over the past few months. \u201cYou talk about fitness, I have the data for Great Britain, China, South Africa, Ireland and Australia. And these girls are on par with them. In every sense. There has been a complete cultural change in training. Normally, I would prefer to test the girls every quarter but here it is done more often. And every time I test them, there is an average 0.2% improvement in their fitness levels, which is too good even at the highest level. They are amazing girls,\u201d Lombard says, one eye on his laptop, tracking the GPS coordinates of the players on field. A Chak De! moment \nThis women\u2019s team first made news in 2016 when they played at the Rio Olympics, qualifying for the quadrennial event for the first time ever \u2014 the only previous appearance in 1980 was invitational. There was little hope but even so, no one expected a last-place finish. Not even the women themselves. \n\u201cWe still believe we were better than what the results showed in Rio, but it wasn\u2019t our best performance. We learnt a lot from that experience,\u201d says 23-year-old Rani Rampal, captain, and one of the seniormost in the team, having made her India debut at 15. Also Read \nIndia\u2019s hockey pride: 2017 may well be the turning point for our women\u2019s team \nThe learnings, however, came later. In the immediate aftermath, it was shock and doubt that surrounded the women. Did they even deserve to be on the world stage? Were they the laughing stock of the hockey world? How could they face the questions back home, from family, friends and complete strangers? \n\u201cShah Rukh Khan in the beginning of Chak De! India must have felt something like that,\u201d the women joke, but the pain is still alive in their voices. \n\u201cIt was bad and it took us some time to recover, yes. But after a while, we decided we had to look at the future, not worry about a past that cannot be changed. Mind se hata diya Rio ko ,\u201d says Deep Grace Ekka, defender and self-proclaimed team chatterbox. \nSays Rani, \u201cMaybe we would never have started on the road to recovery if we had not experienced that loss there. We collectively decided to think two years ahead, to the Asian Games and the CWG. And then, maybe 2020, when we would not be newbies any more.\u201d The women are busy training for the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Australia. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nThese are young women, most of them, and they have mostly stayed away from the media glare. And it shows in their attitude and temperament. Singh says one of the things he has insisted on is that players address each other by their names. And everybody has to ask questions during team meetings. \u201cIt is inherent in their upbringing, the respect for seniors and coaches. But hierarchy in a team cannot win you titles. Now they are slowly coming around,\u201d he says. Largely, though, he prefers to stay in the shadows, allowing the women to tell their own tales. \nAnd they have begun doing so. Forward Vandana Katariya says earlier it was confusing on the field when everyone shouted \u2018 Didi, didi \u2019 for ball possession; that\u2019s changed. \u201cThe coach insists we call each other, and him, by name. We haven\u2019t exactly reached that stage, but we do add a name before \u2018 didi \u2019 now,\u201d she laughs. \nSingh is relentlessly pushing the women to break out of their shells. A month before our meeting, when I contact him to schedule my visit, he is eager and says he looks forward to outsiders visiting. \u201cThe more unscheduled questions the girls are asked, the more they will be forced to think for themselves,\u201d he says. The women admit it has helped. \u201c Thodi daring aa gayi hai ab . Now we know even if we are wrong, they will explain it to us and correct us,\u201d says reserve goalie Rajani Etimarpu. \nSingh knows the importance of routine and repetition. He is also a big fan of the haka (M\u0101ori war cry or ceremonial greeting) and its effect in psyching the opposition on the field. The girls have a chant: \u2018We dream the same dream. We think the same thing. We are the dream team. We are the Indian team. We are a champion team.\u2019 They say it before and after every game, and at every break, every time. It\u2019s amazing how, for a bunch that is as comfortable with English as an emu in flight, these lines just roll off the tongue. And there is no embarrassment; the women shout out at the top of their voices. \u201cI want any team that plays us to know we are in it to win and we will do anything for it. No more shoving us around or walking all over this team any more,\u201d says Singh. \nThe confidence has trickled down to the youngest players. From Namita Toppo and Rajani to Deepika Thakur and Savita, each one believes she is no longer there to simply make up the numbers. \u201cWhen we went to the Asia Cup, everyone was determined to win gold and qualify for the World Cup,\u201d Rajani says. \u201cWe all know what it means to play for India.\u201d Turning point \nIt was during the Europe tour before the Asia Cup, where the women did reasonably well even against the Belgian junior men\u2019s side, that they first believed they could win. The real turning point, however, was the Asian Champions Trophy three months after Rio, where the Indian women won their maiden gold. \u201cThat\u2019s when the first spark was ignited; that even though Rio wasn\u2019t great, we were ending the year on a high and could begin the new year with a new confidence,\u201d says Rani. Skills apart, the team has worked on building confidence and motivation. | Photo Credit: K. Murali Kumar \nIndividual brilliance versus team effort has always been a tricky issue in Indian hockey. While most former greats continue to insist that Indians should rely on individual excellence because that\u2019s what they are good at, a series of foreign coaches have tried to build a firm team structure. \n\u201cOn and off the ground, we are working on improving our understanding of each other. Earlier, there was some selfishness in scoring, but in the past 7-8 months, since Harendra sir took over, most of our goals have come from the second post. The structure has changed a lot. We have actually started playing as a team with everyone thinking of the team result and not the scoresheet,\u201d says Vandana. \n**** \nIt\u2019s half past noon, and training and lunch is over. The women troop in in twos and threes for their daily neurotracker session. It\u2019s an activity they love, the highlight of their day, and perhaps the one thing that has seen their focus and peripheral vision shoot through the roof. \nThe target is simple: eight balls in constant motion on the screen, with four of them picked randomly to change colours. 3D glasses make it more real. The women have to keep tracking the balls that change colour, and identify them every time they stop moving. Each correct attempt increases the speed of the balls, wrong ones slow them down over a set of 30 attempts. The difficulty levels are from basic to advanced. \n\u201cSome of these girls have improved by more than 150% in their focus and performance here. In fact, only P.R. Sreejesh (the men\u2019s goalkeeper) has been able to keep up with them in terms of advancement. These girls are simply amazing,\u201d says SAI psychologist Priyanka Prabhakar. \nDeep Grace loves the activity the most. She operates the software. \u201cWhen Grace is around, all of us just chill. She is the lord and master of this set-up,\u201d laughs Priyanka. \nSingh is also working on making the women up-to-date on all the latest rule changes in international hockey, and the loopholes they can exploit on field. \u201cIt is important to be smart \u2014 you need to decide whether to work your a** off like a donkey or be a smart worker like a horse. International sports is not just about skill and strength, it is equally about smartness,\u201d Singh says. Battle against self \nOn field, the women get grilled for even the slightest signs of indiscipline. \u201cDiscipline is a habit, just like winning and losing are. Small things add up to big achievements. We know it all, but the past few months, we have been working on getting it into our subconscious. The pace at which hockey is played today, the absence of even one player for just two minutes can be critical. Sometimes, we concede soft goals because of it,\u201d Rani says. \nAll this progress, topped with the Asia Cup, where India got the better of three stronger, higher-ranked teams, has finally brought the team in the spotlight. For the first time in recent history, the women\u2019s team received more coverage and appreciation than the men. \nIt has made them more confident but there is no pressure of performance, they say. \u201cEarlier, hardly anybody came to watch women\u2019s games and not many knew of our matches, but now Indian supporters come to watch us; they came in Singapore, Korea and Japan too. It feels good to have that support. But there is no pressure. It only motivates us to do better,\u201d Vandana says. \u201cWe are now determined to do even better in the Commonwealth Games and prove ourselves. This year is very important for us and for women\u2019s hockey to claim its rightful place,\u201d says Rajani. \nIn absolute terms, the journey from a last-place finish at Rio to winning the Asia Cup was not very long. For the women who were part of both campaigns, however, it was a battle they had to fight, and win, against themselves. \nAs Rani says, \u201cLosing all the time had eroded our self-belief and motivation. We had to start from zero and understand that we have to win to convince both ourselves and others that we are good.\u201d \nThey were given few shots to do so, but that absence of spotlight seems a blessing in hindsight. They did not have a coach for more than a month, then three coaches were changed within a year and a half, one halfway through a European tour. But all that churn has seen them emerge even more self-reliant. They now carry that confidence into Gold Coast next month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harendra singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cwg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gold coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T16:18:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f98f9ddcb281b7013397b5d31cd29182a547ff5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDldwgwuQjH.D48w5ap.rYBWk7WPCKh4NMs5zkhoQ2ViAGrYxugBehPe6ggW0Ko6snnAA3tEm477podZlhkpZHqulPBnKubDvsc3ajRdKumH2qL6hKID2VI0cncw9W5I59lP7mHFWr9boG", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bangalore News, Latest Bangalore News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News", "title_full": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News - Times of India", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63424441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1774881,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f98f9ddcb281b7013397b5d31cd29182a547ff5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDldwgwuQjH.D48w5ap.rYBWk7WPCKh4NMs5zkhoQ2ViAGrYxugBehPe6ggW0Ko6snnAA3tEm477podZlhkpZHqulPBnKubDvsc3ajRdKumH2qL6hKID2VI0cncw9W5I59lP7mHFWr9boG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "B V Shivashankar", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Karnataka Assembly polls: Karnataka election to be webcast, monitored in Bengaluru and Delhi | Bengaluru News", "text": "BENGLAURU: The Karnataka assembly polls are set to go hi-tech with plans afoot to digitize the entire process, from managing electoral rolls to monitoring polling stations, through Internet Protocol (IP)-based webcasting and live-streaming of the counting of votes.\nAn Election Monitoring Dash Board (EMDB) will be set up at the offices of the chief election commissioner of India in New Delhi, the chief electoral officer (CEO) in Bengaluru and electoral officers at all district headquarters. EMDB will enable online monitoring both at polling and counting stations.\nWebcast was used on an experimental basis to monitor a few polling stations in the elections in various states between 2014 and 2018. It is the first time that the technology is being adopted to digitize the entire electoral process in a state. \u201cMost of the elements of our tech initiative are being used for the first time in India,\u201d said Sanjiv Kumar, CEO for Karnataka.\nAll 56,994 polling stations in the state will be GISmapped and linked with voters\u2019 Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC).\nAlerts will be sent to mobile phones of voters about their polling station and how to reach there, while a digital atlas of all 224 assembly constituencies will be created.\nSanjiv Kumar said 36 lakh mobile phones of Karnataka\u2019s 5.96 voters have been linked to the web portal so far. \u201cEfforts are on to link all mobiles to the portal before polling,\u201d he said.\nThe functioning of all EVMs and voter-verified audit trail (VVPAT) systems will be monitored. There will also be a software to keep a tab on candidates\u2019 expenditure. While social media accounts of the candidates will be closely monitored, it has been made mandatory for them to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts, and WhatsApp number.\n\u201cUnlike the pilots where laptops were used, digitization of the election process is going to be complete this time and servers will be hired for the purpose for the first time in India. The de-duplication analytic that eliminates redundancy in all stages will bring in high-level efficiency to the whole process,\u201d said Surya Sen A V, joint chief electoral officer in charge of technology adoption.\nWhile 10,000 polling stations considered to be sensitive will be facilitated with IP-based webcasting, the rest would be webcast through live videography. Voters can air their grievances online with ECI\u2019s App Sumadhan, while App Suvidha will be used to issue online permission to parties and candidates for public rallies, and use of vehicles for campaigning.\nTimes ViewAn election is always rife with speculation of cash and liquor for votes, trouble at booths, security issues and a host of other undemocratic happenings. In such an atmosphere, live streaming of the proceedings should come as a welcome change. In this digital era, it is good that the election authorities are adopting technology to make the process of both balloting and counting transparent, and hopefully, more free and fair. This should immediately reduce malpractices. It is hoped that this technology is adopted to ensure voters\u2019 names don\u2019t go missing, as is often the case. It is, after all, a citizen\u2019s right.\nPART DIGITIZATION OF POSTAL BALLOTS\nFor the first time, postal ballots are being sent to army and security personnel online. \u201cActually, this is partial digitization of the postal ballot. While soldiers can download ballots on the ETBS portal, they have to send them by post. This step is taken to ensure data security,\u201d said Sanjiv Kumar.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emdb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjiv kumar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:40:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "174a8405eb166c8ee81e700201703db59bdaacfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpYBuU1mbrZMCD8XUMD3FeK9kAwFIVhdgqBofNREQix9Lsz4ojRRwKOmNZfqmuig4ZffpOSlWbZNh.Z8TMxpFO5YqH0DCUj9CPOsyFa7HmbUFr1Qyk0otTMzN1fu0XGcKc-", "site_full": "businessworld.in", "site": "businessworld.in", "site_section": "http://businessworld.in/rss/todays-article.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Today article", "title": "Microsoft to hold AI summit in Bengaluru on Mar 28", "title_full": "Microsoft to hold AI summit in Bengaluru on Mar 28", "published": "2018-03-25T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.businessworld.in/static/images/BW-logo-200X200_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 87930, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "174a8405eb166c8ee81e700201703db59bdaacfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpYBuU1mbrZMCD8XUMD3FeK9kAwFIVhdgqBofNREQix9Lsz4ojRRwKOmNZfqmuig4ZffpOSlWbZNh.Z8TMxpFO5YqH0DCUj9CPOsyFa7HmbUFr1Qyk0otTMzN1fu0XGcKc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft to hold AI summit in Bengaluru on Mar 28", "text": "  \nNew Delhi , Mar 25 (PTI) Tech giant Microsoft will host 'AI for All' summit in Bengaluru on March 28 to showcase use cases of artificial intelligence across sectors.The event will feature discussions around the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), and how this can be used to amplify human ingenuity, a Microsoft India spokesperson told PTI.\"This is our first summit of its kind in the country.

Das ist ein sehr ermutigendes Signal\", kommentierte Haus & Grund-Pr\u00e4sident Kai Warnecke die heutige Regierungserkl\u00e4rung von Bauminister Horst Seehofer und die daran anschlie\u00dfende Debatte im Bundestag. Er ermunterte die Gro\u00dfe Koalition, parallel den Mietwohnungsmarkt in den Fokus zu nehmen und zukunftsgerichtet weiterzuentwickeln. Haus & Grund wies darauf hin, dass der Erwerb von Wohneigentum die Mietwohnungsm\u00e4rkte entlaste. Wohneigentum sei zudem die beste Vorsorge f\u00fcr das Alter. Da jedoch viele B\u00fcrger die Mietwohnung den eigenen vier W\u00e4nden vorz\u00f6gen, seien ebenso Ma\u00dfnahmen zu ergreifen, um Mietwohnungen zukunftsf\u00e4hig zu halten. Verbandspr\u00e4sident Warnecke forderte die Bundesregierung auf, die folgenden Punkte z\u00fcgig anzugehen: 1. Erwerb von Wohneigentum effektiv f\u00f6rdern: S\u00e4mtliche im Koalitionsvertrag verabredeten Ma\u00dfnahmen m\u00fcssen z\u00fcgig umgesetzt werden. 2. Erwerbsnebenkosten senken: Es ist Aufgabe von Bund und L\u00e4ndern, gemeinsam eine Senkung der Grunderwerbsteuer anzupacken. Steuersenkungen d\u00fcrfen nicht zu einer Utopie verkommen. 3. Modernisierungen erleichtern: Kleine Modernisierungen von Mietwohnungen mit einem Investitionsvolumen von bis zu 10.000 Euro je Wohnung m\u00fcssen k\u00fcnftig unb\u00fcrokratisch umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. 4. KfW-F\u00f6rderung st\u00e4rken: Die KfW-F\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr das altersgerechte Umbauen von H\u00e4usern und Wohnungen muss langfristig gesichert werden. 5. Mietpreisbremse abschaffen: Die Mietpreisbremse ist gescheitert. Statt den Mietwohnungsmarkt immer weiter zu regulieren, sollten die B\u00fcrger ermutigt werden, Wohneigentum nicht nur zur Selbstnutzung zu erwerben, sondern auch, um es zu vermieten. Haus & Grund ist mit rund 900.000 Mitgliedern der mit Abstand gr\u00f6\u00dfte Vertreter der privaten Haus-, Wohnungs- und Grundeigent\u00fcmer in Deutschland. Den Zentralverband mit Sitz in Berlin tragen 22 Landesverb\u00e4nde und \u00fcber 900 Ortsvereine.

The Catalan is one of the most solid openings for White. It forms part of the large and strong fianchetto family in which White builds his strategy mainly around the bishop on g2. The current DVD covers all of Black\u2019s replies to the Catalan, some of which can even transpose to other openings such as the Tarrasch System and the Queen\u2019s Indian. The author\u2019s idea is, as it was in previous DVDs he has published in this area, to help White against all classical setups for Black. Though the DVD is aimed at players of the white pieces, it still might be useful for those who have Black so that they will better understand the coming threats. It would make little sense to mention all the strong players who include the Catalan in their repertoire. Suffice it to say that the Catalan rules! Video running time: 5 hours 29 minutes. GM Daniel King also takes a crack at it for his Power Play Chess channel Kramnik 1-0 Aronian \nVladimir Kramnik had a lot of plans for this tournament \u2014 you could see that easily from his furious start. As the fortunate beneficiary of the wild card, he received a fresh chance to vie for the highest title once more.

The new Executive MBA/MPA is a two-year program and will be taught jointly by the two universities at the Doha Institute\u2019s campus in Qatar. \nThe program, held in English, provides experienced leaders from private, public, and non-profit sectors the opportunity to develop their management skills across all of these areas. While leading universities in the U.S. have been increasingly forging such alliances, this is the first time such a program has come to the Middle East. The program builds on the Qatar National Vision 2030, which seeks to diversify the economy by enhancing the private sector, thus encouraging and maintaining its competitiveness. This results in greater interaction between the public and private sectors and the need for professionals with the skills, knowledge, and flexibility to work and lead in either sector. Graduates from the program will be equipped with sound theoretical knowledge and expertise as well as advanced analytical and management skills. They are expected to hold leadership positions at the interface of business and governance. \u201cIn an increasingly interdependent world, we need responsible managers who can lead effectively at the interface between politics, business, and society. We are delighted to be the first to bring this exceptional dual degree to the Middle East. It combines the profound expertise and knowledge of our two highly recognized universities,\u201d said ESMT President J\u00f6rg Rocholl. The Executive MBA/MPA combines two internationally renowned, successful programs: the EMBA from ESMT and the EMPA from the Doha Institute. The two-year program is modular and can be completed while continuing to work. Modules will take place once per month over three or four days. Most of the courses will be held in Doha, with one core module in Berlin, as well as the opportunity for participants to study at partner institutions in ESMT\u2019s network. Application requirements include a university degree, professional experience of at least five years, as well as very good English skills. The program will start in September 2018. Applications are currently being accepted by the Doha Institute.

These should be used to complement human workers and not take their place, Hofmann said. \n\u201cAlgorithms should not replace humans, but should take over assignments that cannot be solved by humans,\u201d he said. \nThe VW executive expressed optimism about the technology\u2019s potential. \u201cAI will make completely new things possible,\u201d he said. \nHofmann cited inspiration from Isaac Asimov\u2019s 1950 book \u201cI, Robot,\u201d which described a future with multitude of tasks assumed by robots. Asimov stated three basic principles for robots: They should never injure humans, obey orders and protect their own existence. These three principles also broadly apply to AI, Hofmann said. \nThe VW CIO also discussed the potential of Quantum computing-based machine learning, a new area that would allow machine learning to progress faster than is currently possible. Such an approach could help deal with growing data volumes in the auto industry. \nAI can also help when relatively few data are available for analysis, Hofmann said. -By Arjen Bongard", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "isaac asimov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asimov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vw cio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw cio hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw group cio martin hofmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:08:24.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a2dc93c34946dbf03be62c71f5cca4affa3c47d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTafqxhGxxJJr6vLYsHhBr4.CvP9U0Sj_BARLB2OkQhckSE7HtAMxIWgyaEAziAqT.b1fiFQTyUfMJTCDf2Li5P0RIcm.EGmQV.Q_4_Q3L6cjoLsO1KvyLpedbVH7IA8h.JC9.ggr1fSa7wCpfokZGyPH2rzKZZoIA-", "site_full": "www.mdr.de", "site": "mdr.de", "site_section": "http://www.mdr.de/Media/podcast/4268635-podcast.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MDR KULTUR Peter Zudeicks Woche in Berlin", "title": "Peter Zudeick - Die Woche in Berlin vom 23.

But the pool is filled with dirt and scattered with weeds.\nBorn and raised in the Western Downs, Mr Brown is a full-time bus driver. Today, he\u2019s showing a group of farmers around his hometown, Miles, 330km northwest of Brisbane.\nUnlike Mr Brown, these farmers are not from Queensland. They live on properties in New South Wales and South Australia that may soon be impacted by coal seam or shale gas infrastructure. Many are on the high pressure pipeline route from Santos\u2019 controversial proposed Narrabri Gas Project.\nAwaiting the approval of such projects, the farmers are embarking on a four-day tour of southwest Queensland for a first-hand look at its gas infrastructure and the social consequences of boom-bust mining economies.\nmedia_camera Unfortunately for Miles, abandoned houses (and pools) are now common. Picture: Gemma Clarke\nThough it\u2019s not a mining town, Miles was part of southwest Queensland\u2019s coal seam gas construction boom. The explosion in exploration and mining activity in its surrounding areas saw a huge influx in workforce demand and fly-in-fly-out workers from around 2010.\n\u201cGISERA (The CSIRO\u2019s Gas Industry Social & Environmental Research Alliance) put out these fantastic figures,\u201d said David Sweetapple. He\u2019s a real estate agent and land developer in Miles, and has lived in the region for 60 years.\n\u201cThey said they would need accommodation and infrastructure built, and feeding and entertaining. They said we will live locally and buy locally. So the town went wild. The banks lent us all money \u2014 the council spent $30 million in Miles alone on water sewerage and waste management,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said, referring to the time around 2008 when the initial presentation from APLNG (Australia Pacific LNG, Origin Energy\u2019s joint venture with ConocoPhillips and Sinopec) was made.\nExisting homeowners with a patch of backyard to spare subdivided their blocks into two, and towers of flats began to loom over old Queenslanders. Developers and investors flooded in from all over Australia, and there was a surge in new housing with 1500 new homes approved.\nmedia_camera Even new homes have little chance of being sold, at least for nowhere near what they were purchased for. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cIt was like being caught in a gold rush,\u201d said local Rachel Kerwick. She\u2019s president of the Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce, a role she has shared since its inception in 2005 with fellow community member John Hoffman.\n\u201cThere were investors from Melbourne and Sydney, well-educated people who did their homework and believed the literature the government and the CSIRO all put out,\u201d Ms Kerwick said.\nThat literature included an environmental impact statement, a future directions statement, and a social impact management plan, a detailed document that outlines how APLNG would mitigate the social impacts that arise from their work in the Western Downs region.\nMiles\u2019s population was projected to increase to 5000 people, and a growth in the workforce was predicted to continue until 2034.\n\u201cThey were talking about the town of Miles and Chinchilla actually merging,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple.\nFor locals leasing housing, the immediate effect of the boom was a rent increase.\nMr Brown set a scene as the bus winds through a half-finished estate behind the racecourse.\n\u201cImagine you\u2019ve got a son who finishes school and wants to stay around. He gets a job at the local council, where he can make a weekly salary of $700, and he doesn\u2019t bother buying, because he can rent for $300 a week. His wife works at the tuckshop; the kids are in the swimming club. Then the miners move in, and the agent knocks on his door and says, \u2018Sorry mate, but we can get $800 for this place now.\u2019 So your son and his family leave town.\u201d\nAccording to Mr Sweetapple, one look at property and housing prices during the boom will show that Mr Brown\u2019s scenario is not hard to picture.\n\u201cYou\u2019d buy a block for $200,000,\u201d Mr Sweetapple explained, \u201cand spend $450,000 on a really nice house; put in Colorbond fencing and paving. The rent at the time was $800 to $1000 a week.\u201d\nAt the peak of the boom, even a space at one of the local caravan parks crept up to nearly $1000 per week. Long-term residents who could no longer afford the rent moved out.\nBut when the construction phase of all major coal seam gas projects progressed to the export phase, many mining contractors and employees were laid off. And once the Condabri workers camp that many of them were living in was emptied, the overflow of those renting in Miles were shifted to fill the camp\u2019s 400 beds.\nmedia_camera Not only have houses been abandoned, but businesses as well. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cOrigin walked into our real estate office one day at the end of 2013 and said, \u2018We\u2019re cancelling every lease of the houses we have. If anyone wants a job, they have to live in the camp,\u2019\u201d said Mr Sweetapple. \u201cVirtually overnight, in December 2013, the town just drained out of people and they never came back.\u201d\nAs per APLNG\u2019s social impact management plan, construction workers are often accommodated in temporary facilities like Condabri to help ensure that community demographics in regional towns are not negatively impacted from an influx of new residents. But given that more than 100 workers were initially housed in Miles to begin with, their absence was felt immediately.\n\u201cWe had hundreds living in a camp less than 25km from our town for years,\u201d Ms Kerwick said, \u201cand they never even came in. They might have driven through the community on their way to work, and occasionally, if we were doing a community event like the races, they\u2019d send a busload of people in, but that was it.\u201d\nMr Sweetapple too is frustrated about the mining companies\u2019 failure to engage with the town in the way they promised in the APLNG documents published in 2010 and 2011.\n\u201cHaving told us they were going to live local and buy local, they then said, \u2018Local for us is camps out of town. We\u2019re living in the area.\u2019 As for buy local, they said, \u2018We\u2019re a multinational company. We\u2019re APLNG and local for us is Australia and New Zealand, not Miles and Chinchilla.\u201d\nFor its part, an Origin spokesman told news.com.au: \u201cOrigin, as Upstream Operator of Australia Pacific LNG, is proud to have committed tens of millions of dollars to support local communities such as Miles, and remains committed to the region by continuing to provide incentives for our staff to live locally and by sourcing local goods and services through our \u2018Regional Buy\u2019 program.\u201d\nHe added Origin has spent millions of dollars to benefit the local community, including investing $2,000,000 into a community skills scholarship, providing up to $13,500 to apprentices within the gas fields region to help them complete their apprenticeships locally. Since 2007, more than 150 scholarships have been awarded. Origin has also invested in housing, plus water and sewage upgrades in the region, and upgraded the local airport to the tune of $20 million among other projects.\nAccording to Mr Brown, the only people who will benefit from a boom are publicans, local councillors, real estate agents and investors.\n\u201cThe local drapery store won\u2019t, [the mining workers] won\u2019t buy shirts from there. They\u2019re nomadic. They move around all the time and follow the work. And if someone does bring his family, do you think his wife is going to work in the school tuckshop?\u201d\nAfter the last of the mining workers were shifted out to Condabri, the vacancy rate in Miles rose to 45 per cent, where it stayed at for several years.\n\u201cRents were down to $150 a week for those fortunate to have it,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said. \u201cThat was furnished apartments, furnished houses.\u201d\nAccording to Ms Kerwick, some people just walked out, and those who stayed all suffered financially.\nmedia_camera Farmers from NSW and SA inspecting the coal seam projects near Miles. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cWe\u2019re left with people whose businesses went bankrupt and who lost their homes because they took the punt and invested in building another one. Mortgages and repossessions are happening at least once a week,\u201d she said.\nThe incomplete estate behind the racecourse Mr Brown drives through is owned by Mr Sweetapple. It still has four stages of completion to go, but construction has halted.\n\u201cIn my estate, there have been three of four mortgage and repossession sales, and they\u2019ve sold for $20,000 to $22,000 a block,\u201d the real estate agent said.\nToday, Miles\u2019 population stands at just 1800, a number that now has to front the cost for the $30 million worth of infrastructure they no longer actually need. Mr Sweetapple said the rates on the properties he owns in town have doubled in the last four years.\n\u201cWe have even less people than we did before [the boom],\u201d said Ms Kerwick. \u201cThe Miles community itself was almost decimated. Brand new homes that cost the investor $700,000 to build are being sold for $200,000.\u201d\nMr Brown tells a story about his neighbour, a woman from interstate who bought the house next door to his for $400,000.\n\u201cShe subdivided the block and developed it, then just sold them both: one for $200,000 and the other for $160,000,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Mr Sweetapple, the aftermath of the mining boom completely killed the market.\n\u201cThe rents plummeted, the property values plummeted and they kept the camp full. That\u2019s when I read very carefully through all the Origin lease documents and the approvals granted by the Coordinator-General,\u201d he said.\nIn 2016, Mr Sweetapple discovered a condition in Origin\u2019s 2010 Environmental Impact Statement that said under no circumstances can a temporary workers accommodation facility exist beyond five years.\nmedia_camera The town has been left with plenty of vacant lots when businesses left town. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cThey were in breach already. [The Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce] got more and more politically active, and we met with [Origin\u2019s] CEO eight times. He basically said that if you make it difficult for us, we\u2019ll make it doubly difficult for you.\u201d\nThen in May 2017, after months of negotiations, the multinational corporation announced that it would close its Condabri workers camp for good later that year. Origin\u2019s remaining operations staff would have to move into local accommodation arrangements in Miles, as well as in neighbouring towns such as Chinchilla.\n\u201cHad we not as a community fought that very hard, they\u2019d still be in that camp,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple.\nIn August last year, the Queensland government legislated against workforces on large resource projects within 125km of regional communities being 100 per cent fly-in-fly-out workers.\nAccording to the government\u2019s social impact statement, the Strong and Sustainable Resource Communities Act was introduced to \u201censure that residents of communities in the vicinity of large resource projects benefit from their construction and operation\u201d.\n\u201cStraight away you could see the difference,\u201d said Ms Kerwick. \u201cThey can still build a camp, but it has to be within the town. In Chinchilla, the camp is in the fringes of the community, so the people can go to the town gym, use the town pool, go to the pub a couple of nights a week if they don\u2019t want to have tea at the camp.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive positive,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t come without its own problems.\u201d\nWhile in the camp, a worker\u2019s living expenses are completely covered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re flown in and out, you\u2019re given whatever you want to eat or drink. Your electricity, your cleaning, your internet is all covered. You want for nothing.\u201d\nBut now that workers in the Miles region are no longer allowed to reside in a camp away from town, living away from home allowances have been slashed.\n\u201cBy the time [the workers] pay tax, they end up with $153 extra a week. That\u2019s got to provide [everything]. They come into our office and say, \u2018How the hell am I going to survive on this money?\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s already hard \u2014 they\u2019re away from their families trying to make a living, and suddenly they\u2019ve got to come up with this extra money to compensate for what they had in the camp.\u201d\nWhen Mr Brown is asked who is left in Miles, and what he thinks of the town\u2019s future, he is largely optimistic, though complains about the lack of social services in place to support many of the low-income earners who have moved in to take advantage of the cheap rent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good vibe mostly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are just too many empty houses. Who is going to live in them? There\u2019s no work.\u201d\nmedia_camera The town is more than half an hour drive from Chinchilla, and with little work in town, many locals have abandoned Miles.\nBut Mr Sweetapple said new projects are on the horizon.\n\u201cMiles is in the Goldilocks zone \u2014 we\u2019re very close to the power grid and we get the most sunlight. All those substations are in place to receive some of the renewable energy that\u2019s being produced by the solar farms,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got massive upgrades to the power infrastructure to receive all this solar energy. The rail line has to be built from Miles to Banana, Nathan Dam has to be constructed and a big pipeline is needed to droughtproof the town.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a bit of optimism around again \u2014 not enough for spectators, but enough.\u201d\nAs for the gas industry?\n\u201cOrigin has offered [its workers] a very generous incentive,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said. \u201cThe average guy will get about $35,000 extra a year if he buys locally. But no one is doing it because they don\u2019t know week to week if they\u2019ll have a job. There\u2019s been a big restructuring \u2014 Origin is trying to wind back its costs, so they\u2019ve laid off hundreds of staff. The last thing any workers want to do then is buy a house in Miles and get caught with it.\n\u201cUnless [the workers] are forced to pay for their flights in and out or the government intervenes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any change. [The coal seam gas industry] has been a complete and utter disaster for the town.\u201d\nMr Sweetapple said he recently received a survey from a company contracted by Santos to assess its community impacts. In 2007, Santos created the GLNG project, which converts natural gas from the Surat and Bowen Basins into LNG for export to Asia.\n\u201cIt said, \u2018Santos has donated $630,000 to the region. Do you agree, disagree or strongly disagree?\u2019 If they\u2019d said, \u2018Santos has spent $630,000 \u2014 can you see where it\u2019s gone?\u2019 or, \u2018What impact has this company had on your community?\u2019 it would have been good, but there was nothing like that.\u201d\nmedia_camera Tony van Lubeck and Tony Smith inspecting a property outside Miles while researching what can happen to a former boom town.\nInstead, Mr Sweetapple made his own survey, and circulated it among 100 people in Miles. Using a company statement that discussed the mitigation of impact on communities, he apportioned the exact wording of the text with a line down the middle.\n\u201cI asked \u20181 out 10, how well did this company do in Miles?\u2019 The highest score they got was a 4. I sent that to the Coordinator-General. He said, \u2018Oh no, that\u2019s not an official survey.\u2019\u201d\nAccording to the APLNG\u2019s community investment action plan, the multinational corporation is dedicated to funding social infrastructure, as well as sponsoring and donating to local organisations\u2019 projects or events. They also aim to foster dialogue with communities, which is a commitment Mr Sweetapple said Origin\u2019s regional manager, Tim Ogilvie, has fulfilled.\n\u201cTim has been very understanding of [Miles\u2019] cause \u2026 he attends Chamber meetings and has met with us regularly. It\u2019s directives from senior executives that have caused so much financial and emotional hardship.\u201d\nMs Kerwick said big players like Origin have failed to adequately assist the community.\n\u201cThey splashed their money and gave some clubs laptops, but they never built any sustainable projects,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly now that [The Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce] has fought for money we can do a few legacy projects, but the whole thing was handled very poorly.\u201d\n\u201cYou can see why the community feels like it does,\u201d said David. \u201cThe gas companies have damaged the very fabric of our town. We were all encouraged to gear up to provide for 40 years of partnership with the resource companies. But they only use tier-1 and tier-2 contractors \u2014 they don\u2019t use the locals.\u201d\nAs the bus tour winds down, Mr Brown returns his passenger to the local museum so they can continue on to Roma. The mood in the car is sombre.\n\u201cThe gas industry\u2019s claims are pretty false that there\u2019s not much impact,\u201d said Tony Smith of Broadwater in Warren, NSW. \u201cIt\u2019s as much social as it is environmental. If you look at the town of Tara, it didn\u2019t seem to gain. The destruction of Miles is terrible. Greed got in the way, and now there are all those empty houses.\u201d\nMs Sweetapple said that farmers like Mr Smith, who will be directly impacted by the proposed 450km pipeline that will link the Moomba Sydney Pipeline to the planned Narrabri Gas Project, should think very carefully before signing anything.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the town is the most devastating thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any community was considering it, I\u2019d seriously say don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t get involved. Don\u2019t believe a word they say. Don\u2019t believe anything Treasury says.

Referee Ashley Klein penalised Tigers forward Robbie Rochow for not standing square at marker in the sixth minute of golden point. Broncos winger Jamayne Isaako kicked the penalty goal to hand his side a 9-7 victory. The decision stunned Tigers coach Ivan Cleary and shattered his side\u2019s hopes of an unbeaten start to the season. Play Video Having reviewed the decision, referees\u2019 boss Bernard Sutton declared his officials got it wrong. \"Ultimately, the penalty was incorrect,\" Sutton told Fairfax Media. \"There are a couple of contributing factors to how the referees came to that decision. Advertisement \"Initially, Robbie Rochow doesn\u2019t start square, but he does adjust as the play-the-ball happens. \"The other thing is when [Joe] Ofahengaue plays the ball, after playing it he steps towards the left. It gives the illusion to the referees that [Robbie] Rochow is standing standing beside, but he actually does adjust to the point where the ball is to be played. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s incorrect.\u201d Sutton contacted Cleary on Saturday morning to inform the club of the NRL\u2019s verdict on the call. \u201cIvan and I have a reasonable relationship, we talk on a regular basis. We will continue to chat,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cEveryone (Klein and assistant referee Matt Noyen) matched up their information in arriving to that decision. There is no one person responsible.\u201d Asked if either whistleblower was facing the axe given it was a match-deciding blunder, Sutton said: \u201cCertainly we are not considering that at this point. We have another five games to go from the weekend. The big thing for us is to get through the weekend and then sit down on Monday and assess how we have come through each of the eight games. \"Then we can set some direction going forward. We won\u2019t make any consideration on that until we get to the end of the weekend.\" The other man at the centre of the storm, Robbie Rochow, conceded he wasn\u2019t sure if he had transgressed. \"I played every minute of that game and you just don't know,\" Rochow said after the game. \"You're out on your feet - especially during golden point - and I just did my best to get to the kicker. Whether I left early or wasn't square I'm not sure. I didn't know if someone was offside and it's just the decision on the day, isn't it? An exciting finish ended up a fizzer after a penalty, now deemed incorrect, was given. Photo: Dean Lewins \"Once the decision is made - whether it's right or wrong - you can't change the decision. The game was over. Whether he justifies it or not it doesn't matter. \"Just winning off a penalty in golden point is not a thrilling way to win I guess. \"A game like that, the way we played and the way it went at the end I would have been happy with a draw. [Golden point] has obviously got a place in our game, but whether it's during our week to week rounds is up to the game to decide.\" The Broncos were the beneficiaries of another close call when Isaako may have put his foot on the sideline. Sutton said, on the evidence available, he was satisfied with the decision for the touch judge not to put up his flag. There has been a spate of penalties in the opening rounds as officials crack down on the play-the-ball and the 10 metres. The stoppages have upset fans and commentators who feel free-flowing footy has been stifled. However, Sutton remained unapologetic. Loading \"The work they have done on the 10 metres has been really good and what the competition committee has asked us to do,\" Sutton said. \"We\u2019re actually enforcing the rules and have had the same approach to the play-the-balls. What he have seen over three weeks is that the play-the-balls have improved. They are the standards we need to maintain and keep the referees making decisions and refereeing with confidence.\" Sutton said he was still reviewing the Panthers-Bulldogs game and that a verdict hadn\u2019t been reached on whether Moses Mbye\u2019s opening try was the result of an obstruction. Frustrated Panthers coach Anthony Griffin said players would be left with no choice but to take dives to ensure the call went their way.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adrian proszenko larg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashley klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie rochow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamayne isaako", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean lewins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan cleary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nrl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wests tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T04:37:25.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03ccf29dfc8f78cfaed3c8fb40985afd1046013c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_RtBZbHhoY6cSXS7GBfwPeGDWVwOWJ7_ROFKdTy14MxvZ0vQXnzwRbZXW9NLLjkKQuDTEuEmi_Rv", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au/homepage/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "ABC Homepage", "title": "Insect numbers in decline", "title_full": "Insect numbers in decline", "published": "2018-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/7979722-16x9-large.jpg?v=2", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1031, "comments": 0, "shares": 1031}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03ccf29dfc8f78cfaed3c8fb40985afd1046013c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_RtBZbHhoY6cSXS7GBfwPeGDWVwOWJ7_ROFKdTy14MxvZ0vQXnzwRbZXW9NLLjkKQuDTEuEmi_Rv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Insect numbers in decline", "text": "Try to Download directly (18.10 MB) Play Press play then disable your screen reader.

It\u2019s a savvy legal move that will compel the AFL to completely rethink its approach to sanctioning women.\n\nAFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence Read more \nBrennan\u2019s two-game ban raised immediate allegations of sex-based discrimination . The reason was simple: were Brennan were a man, she would have been asked to pay a fine, instead of being suspended. The sole reason women do not get the option of paying a fine is wage disparity (the average wage for a men\u2019s AFL player is $371,000, whereas AFLW rookies receive just $10,500). Rather than opting to have the women pay smaller fines on a pro rata basis, the AFL went with a different system that results in them being sanctioned more severely.\nThere has been an explosion of public interest in the case this week. There have also been many misconceptions about the relationship between elite sporting competitions and the law. Although sporting competitions are entitled to develop their own rules, those rules must comply with overarching legal obligations. In Australia this includes the Federal Sex Discrimination Act, which prevents discrimination against people on the basis of their sex, except in very specific circumstances.\nBrennan twice appealed the suspension. Surprisingly, her legal team didn\u2019t pursue this line of argument at the first hearing. At the second hearing , she did, represented by a team of lawyers including Jack Rush QC and Bulldogs president, Peter Gordon. The AFL argued that Brennan\u2019s legal team should have raised those arguments the first time around, were barred from raising entirely new arguments the second time around, and were simply trying to have a second bite at the cherry. Disappointingly, the appeals board deliberated for just 15 minutes, gave no reasons for its decision, and dismissed the appeal. The failure to provide an explanation for its decision raised even more legal questions, including the possibility that this was itself a denial of a fundamental legal principle \u2013 that of procedural fairness. \nKatie Brennan falls victim to gender pay gap with AFLW grand final ban | Kate O'Halloran Read more \nAll eyes were on the Bulldogs\u2019 next move. Gordon is a renowned litigator who rarely shies away from a fight and as social media exploded with speculation, a #FreeKatieBrennan movement was launched, including a petition . There was growing recognition that Brennan was a victim of circumstance, and an imperfect system which yielded a result only made possible because there are different \u2013 and more severe \u2013 rules for women.\nOn Friday morning, the Dogs announced that they would not seek an injunction in the supreme or federal court. But then came the kicker. In an unexpected move, the club announced that Brennan is lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the suspension was unlawful on human rights grounds.\nThe Commission will not deal with the case before the grand final this weekend. Brennan will not play. But the lodging of a human rights complaint is a strategic masterstroke that forces the AFL into an impossible position. Here\u2019s why: the Commission is an independent third party, whose job is to investigate human rights complaints and to help parties resolve their disputes. The Commission will ask the AFL to consider the specifics of Brennan\u2019s complaint, before overseeing a conciliation. There, Brennan will sit down with the AFL to air her concerns and the Commission will try to help them both come to a resolution.\nBrennan will almost certainly demand three things from the AFL: that they admit the tribunal system unfairly discriminates against women; that they overhaul the system so that the rules are fair and no other woman will be put in Brennan\u2019s position again; and finally, that her suspension be wiped from the historic record, as a matter of principle.\nIf the AFL does not accede, Brennan can go to the federal court and seek a hearing. The AFL will be taking a huge risk if it allows things to go that far. It cannot afford a formal court hearing where such arguments are thrashed out by teams of lawyers, with QCs getting paid hourly rates comparable to an entire season\u2019s wage for many of the women. \nBrennan grand final suspension shows AFLW needs stand-alone tribunal Read more \nIt would be a public relations disaster for the AFL, and generate significant bad blood with players and fans, including the new audience it has found through the AFLW. Most of all, the AFL cannot afford to risk the chance of a formal federal court finding that its fledgling AFLW competition \u2013 a pillar of its putative commitment to gender equality and equal opportunity for women \u2013 is inherently discriminatory. It would be a disastrous result for CEO Gil McLachlan, and one that he will be desperate to avoid.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s almost certain that the AFL will capitulate at the first hurdle, and accede to some \u2013 and perhaps all \u2013 of Brennan\u2019s demands at conciliation. The AFL will be asked to admit that its system \u2013 while well-intentioned \u2013 wasn\u2019t perfect and produced a perverse result that has left Brennan on the wrong side of history. Her move is a hugely significant one, not just for current AFLW footballers, but for future generations of girls and women who will play the game. A star on the field, Brennan has now laid down a huge challenge to the code off it. The ball is now in the AFL\u2019s court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics AFLW Australian rules football Australia sport comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie brennan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriet cordner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sport western bulldogs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "human rights commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aflw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:23:56.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44940e0691748b3e331ba0d45e9ac14340e7b7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i_EGca3Aw3P7S2DLLEMrfppFjS77XtSnUbvApbb0NNrILZpW5dVxhAGjk96oaWcHgOKTpKf3.UYQVD9ngBd46sPTEZJ3pu9UHYsgvkiTYUXgw--", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au//news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "title_full": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "published": "2018-03-25T02:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9128120-16x9-700x394.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 722, "comments": 0, "shares": 722}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44940e0691748b3e331ba0d45e9ac14340e7b7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i_EGca3Aw3P7S2DLLEMrfppFjS77XtSnUbvApbb0NNrILZpW5dVxhAGjk96oaWcHgOKTpKf3.UYQVD9ngBd46sPTEZJ3pu9UHYsgvkiTYUXgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Conifer", "published": "2018-03-25T02:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "text": "The ACCCE will also include members of the financial intelligence agency AusTrac and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. \nThe AFP's child protection operations will also grow from about 100 to 170 staff by mid-2020. \n\"This will have a big impact,\" Mr Dutton said. \n\"As any parent knows, we want to make sure we take care of our children, we want to make sure that we eliminate this threat from our society.\" \nThe $68.6 million boost will be included in May's budget. \nShadow Justice Minister Clare O'Neil said Labor welcomed any extra funding to protect children. \n\"Labor is absolutely committed to keeping children safe,\" Ms O'Neil said \n\"We were very concerned by cuts to the AFP in recent years, which the commissioner himself said were affecting the AFP's discretionary work, including their child exploitation work.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan conifer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter dutton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turnbull government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian federal police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "criminal intelligence commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T04:43:47.096+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e371974af900a89abddde1ce7ab0dd740c3e5879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3X6llCpdpJdkoB2CoyrwqvvDQ0P5o4H7dER8BOnpWFK9MDDdvPlghiUqCQPuumKSdLKBZv0IZwj12xOs9c1Q7p7MJfJCcWmFRsqpQpQtTsJkXntlCUfYe2Xa.9y1.UEOfQIoSGkw4G3sLOQpxgrVKxmt6uD5E86x9NHeexYgS.IoQ10x9HJGjH80yoaOVvoINY", "site_full": "www.foxsports.com.au", "site": "foxsports.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "NRL | NRL Live Scores | NRL Ladder &amp;

For the 61-year-old, his day revolves around a single six hour \u201ceating window\u201d between 1pm and 7pm, where he will consume around 2500 calories. \nThe remaining 18 hours of the day is for fasting \u2014 where only water, black coffee and green tea is allowed. \n\u201cThe underlying problem with obesity is insulin,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBy eating regularly throughout the day, the body isn\u2019t given an opportunity to bring insulin levels back down to zero. Instead, the levels are always elated. Carbohydrates, which turn in to sugar, keep that level up. \n\u201cThis leads to insulin intolerance which means to receive that spike in energy levels, the body needs to have more glucose.\u201d media_camera Dr Renaut says forget breakfast, and use the time in the morning to work out. \nInsulin is produced by the pancreas, and is a main regulator for sugar levels in the blood. When we eat, glucose levels rise, and insulin is released into the bloodstream. Often, insulin is dubbed as the \u2018key\u2019 to energy levels, because it opens up cells so they can take in the sugar and use it as an energy source. \nDr Renaut said we need to allow our body to stop insulin production for a large potion of the day to allow our cells to use up the fatty acids instead. \n\u201cAll the diets concentrate on the amount of food we eat, and that is the least important because that\u2019s not what\u2019s increasing insulin,\u201d he said. \n\u201cOnce upon a time, man would go days without food. They wouldn\u2019t wake up and say \u2018what\u2019s for breakfast\u2019. \n\u201cNow, some people have around six meals a day which means the insulin levels never drop to zero. \n\u201cWhen it comes to food, there are three main factors: How much do we eat, what type of food we eat, and the amount that we eat. Of those three, the most important is when we eat it.\u201d media_camera Dr Renaut said to restrict eating to a six hour window. \nA recent study by the University of Surrey, which was published in the British Journal of Nutrition this month , showed that not only can intermittent energy restriction assist with weight loss, it will also clear fat from the blood quicker after eating meals than daily calorie restriction diets. \nThe study, which only used a very small sample size of participants, the group were assigned to either the 5:2 diet or a daily calorie restriction diet and were required to lose five per cent of their weight. \nThose on the 5:2 diet ate normally for five days and for their two fasting days consumed just 600 calories. Those on the daily diet were advised to eat 600 calories less per day than their estimated requirements for weight maintenance (in the study women ate approx. 1400 calories and men ate approx. 1900 calories each day). \nThe research showed that those on the 5:2 diet achieved 5 per cent weight-loss in 59 days compared to those on the daily calorie restriction diet who achieved their goal in 73 days. \nAccording to the Australian Food Standards Code , a balanced diet for an average adult is made up of 8,700 kilojoules of energy, 50 grams of protein, 70g of fat, 24g of saturated fatty acids, 310g of carbohydrates, 90g of sugars, 2.3g of sodium (salt) and 30g of fibre. media_camera Dr Andrew Renaut says the key to losing weight is by only eating six hours daily. \nBut as part of the plan, which Dr Renaut said is not a \u2018diet\u2019 but rather a \u2018method of eating\u2019, means breakfast is off the menu. \n\u201cPeople need to stop eating for a significant amount of the day and stop eating refined carbs,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when you do the feeding window, but later in the day tends to be easier for people. You still need to consume the same amount of calories you normally would \u2014 so 2000 for women and 2500 for men \u2014 and you\u2019re not restricting anything except for carbohydrates.\u201d \nFor Dr Renaut, a day on a plate usually consists of fresh fish, meat and poultry, cheese, vegetables and dairy. He doesn\u2019t include any for of carbohydrate, including bread and pasta. \n\u201cI think this eating plan is something everyone could do,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBy not restricting, you\u2019re not running the risk of running in to deficiency because there\u2019s nothing out of the diet except for carbohydrates.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vanessa brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renaut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew renaut", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T02:37:08.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 563, "moreResultsAvailable": 553, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746604492&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AAU+location%3ABrisbane&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 844, "extra": {"place": "Brisbane", "country": "AU", "lat": "-27.4697707", "lng": "153.0251235"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "a6f0dd032eb94b34377f251929227044c21e06a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8U0yc.UiPakvMU9qvqge7Mi4ZVMwmX8H1ss8_jA4vI744T3qNdcFRcKhtXZDU9wBgjZHPV7MytWftFe55YtaxO", "site_full": "www.xpats.com", "site": "xpats.com", "site_section": "http://www.xpats.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "", "title": "'March for our lives' in Brussels to demand US gun reform", "title_full": "'March for our lives' in Brussels to demand US gun reform", "published": "2018-03-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xpats.com/sites/default/files/800px-tam_high_vigil_for_parkland_school_shooting_25427251787.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6f0dd032eb94b34377f251929227044c21e06a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8U0yc.UiPakvMU9qvqge7Mi4ZVMwmX8H1ss8_jA4vI744T3qNdcFRcKhtXZDU9wBgjZHPV7MytWftFe55YtaxO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paul McNally", "published": "2018-03-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "'March for our lives' in Brussels to demand US gun reform", "text": "'March for our lives' in Brussels to demand US gun reform Education 20:08 22/03/2018 \nYouth activists have organised a demonstration in central Brussels this Saturday, calling for stronger US gun legislation after a spate of shootings. \nOn 14 February, a student used an AR-15 to kill 14 of his classmates and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \nEver since the tragic incident, uproar has sparked not only in the United States, but across the globe.

An ENTSO-E's dedicated project team is preparing the proposal following the specifications enclosed in the GLEB Art. 52(2). To incorporate the opinion of stakeholders in the drafting process of the All-TSO proposal, ENTSO-E plans to organise an informal workshop, and by that gather different points of view and comments. The workshop will be held in Brussels, at the ENTSO-E premises on 23 March. The intention of this workshop is to gather ideas that can help improving the proposal under development. The workshop is not part of a public consultation, nor will formal or informal ENTSO-E positions be shared. However presentations will be given on the scope, planning and outcomes of a survey performed amongst all TSOs, including third parties entrusted with settlement tasks on the topic of imbalance settlement. This introduction will be followed by a set of round-table sessions on the following sub-topics: Main components for calculation of the imbalance price Definition of the value of avoided activation Conditions for application of dual pricing Finalisation of imbalance adjustment, position and allocated volume \u200b The maximum number of attendants will be 100 people. Please contact Ricardo Renedo Williams ( ricardo.renedowilliams@entsoe.eu ) for registration before Friday 16 March .

The 6th Award for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMP) was presented to Turda (Romania). Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc said: \" ...these cities are not only creating a more sustainable Europe, but are helping their residents to move around in a cleaner, healthier and more enjoyable way. It is my hope that by selecting these cities, their actions will inspire others to embrace the core message of EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK \u2013 sustainable mobility is the right choice for everyone.\" The EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award showcases local authorities that demonstrate significant efforts in promoting sustainable urban mobility, while the SUMP Award recognises outstanding sustainable urban mobility planning, this year focusing on shared mobility in the planning process . \nVienna, Austria received the EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award 2017 for larger municipalities. The Austrian capital, impressed the jury with its outstanding programme of activities during EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK, which reflected a firm understanding of the theme of the 2017 campaign - Clean, shared, and intelligent mobility . Among other activities, residents of Vienna were able to rent cargo bikes free of charge, take guided walks through different city neighbourhoods, and join an urban picnic on a street previously reserved for vehicles. One initiative saw crowds positioned at busy bicycle intersections, providing cyclists with a round of applause for choosing a sustainable transport method. The city also worked with kindergartens to educate children on sustainable modes of transport. \nIgoumenitsa in Greece received the first ever EUROPEAN MOBILITY WEEK Award 2017 for smaller municipalities. The city took home the honour for exemplary work in communicating the benefits of sustainable mobility to residents, including those who live in nearby small towns. \nTurda in Romania received the 6th Award for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning for its clear planning vision, robust financing strategy, and measurable targets. The jury noted the replicability of the strategy and its potential to inspire other similarly-sized cities (Turda has a population of around 50,000 inhabitants). The jury also found that the level of ambition within the plan was high given the relatively small size of the city, particularly in the field of shared mobility. \nGreater Manchester (United Kingdom) and Milan (Italy) were fellow finalists for the 6th edition of the SUMP Award. \nFor more information on the campaign, visit www.mobilityweek.eu Country:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

the lead on problem-solving focus of Voka Congress , \u2018Everyone is an entrepreneur,\u2019 says Voka , Tour of Flanders Centre shows visitors how to race like the pros Summary \nIn the latest in a two-month case that has gripped Flanders\u2019 art community \u2013 and beyond \u2013 police in Ghent have sealed a collection of Russian avant-garde art on suspicion of forgery Museum director suspended In the latest development in the situation of 24 works of Russian avant-garde art on display at Ghent\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, judicial authorities have carried out a search of the museum, as well as the home of the owner of the collection. For months, experts have claimed that many of the artworks are fakes. \nThe owner of the works, Brussels-based art collector Igor Toporovski, has started a non-profit organisation to put the works \u2013 and more \u2013 on permanent display in the Brussels municipality of Jette. But first he loaned them to Ghent\u2019s Fine Art Museum (MSK). \nBecause of a recent spate of fakes discovered in the world of Russian modern art, international dealers took an interest in the pieces \u2013 mostly paintings but also sculpture. Several even travelled to Ghent to see them in person. The works are by pioneering artists of the period such as Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky and Vladimir Tatlin. \nIn January, 10 international dealers and curators penned an open letter, published in local media, calling into question the authenticity of \u201cnearly all\u201d of the works. The museum\u2019s director, Catherine de Zegher, said that all the paperwork for the works was in order. When questioned by city councillors, she said that the works had been examined by two experts in Russian avant-garde art before being put on display. Analysis ordered \nFlemish culture minister Sven Gatz, however, ordered an independent analysis. He assembled a team of four experts and brought them to Ghent to work together with the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage to determine whether or not the paintings and sculptures were authentic. In the meantime, the museum decided to dismantle the exhibition. \nThe day last month that the analysis was to begin, additional demands were made by Toporovski\u2019s lawyer. According to Gatz, they demanded to know why the works had been called into question. \u201cThese conditions make it impossible to get the analysis started,\u201d said Gatz. \u201cThey are a deal-breaker.\u201d \nDe Zegher told De Standaard that she was deeply disappointed that the experts could not make a determination, thereby clearing the MSK of any wrong-doing. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that it ended up this way,\u201d she said. \nIf there is no co-operation and in fact the attempt is made even more difficult, that suggests that there is a reason to be suspicious - Culture minister Sven Gatz \nGatz has now stepped away from the situation entirely. \u201cThere was a suspicion of fault here, and I wanted to act as a mediator,\u201d he told De Standaard . \u201cBut if there is no co-operation and in fact the attempt is made even more difficult, that suggests that there is a reason to be suspicious. The MSK is a city institution. I wanted to take an impartial role here, but now they\u2019re on their own.\u201d \nEarlier this month, the city council suspended De Zegher, saying that the experts who she claimed analysed the works before they were exhibited in the museum denied any such co-operation. The city has asked the director to provide proof that the experts were called in. It has also sent auditors to the museum to examine the procedures involved with curating exhibitions. \nFinally, in the latest news, this week police carried out a search of the museum, sealing the depot where the works are being stored and confiscating documents and computers. According to information obtained by De Standaard , Toporovski\u2019s home in Brussels was also searched as were two other locations not divulged by the authorities. \nAlthough judicial authorities had not been involved previously, they were forced to respond to a complaint filed by a group of four international art dealers who claim that the entire situation has disrupted the art market, affecting their business.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "voka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flanders",

thrilled to launch its S hared P ersonalised A utonomous C onnected v E hicles (SPACE) project during a kick-off meeting held Thursday, 22 March 2018 in Brussels, Belgium.The project counts on 45 participants from 18 countries, all members of UITP, who will collaborate for the duration of the project period which will last between 18 to 24 months.UITP\u2019s SPACE project aims at placing public transport at the centre of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) revolution that is emerging everywhere in the world.Led by UITP, this project will give members the right tools and knowledge to provide more efficient and better services.In his welcome speech during the event,   emphasised the importance for cities to \u201cprepare for the transition, but also that policy makers don\u2019t only look at autonomous vehicles from a technological or industry point of view, but also from a \u2018mobility\u2019 point of view\u2019\u2019.Mr Mezghani added that AVs should not only be \u201cabout introducing a new technology, but about benefiting from the technology to change our approach to mobility and our behaviours\u201d.In order to achieve this, the SPACE project will assess the impacts of automated road transport systems, develop operational concepts and new business models and it will advocate for a harmonised framework to allow AVs safe operation in real mobility scenarios.The SPACE project will be divided into four working groups covering Connected and Autonomous Mobility, Technical Reference Architecture, Observatory & Experience Monitoring and User Acceptance, Impact Assessment & Stakeholder Engagement.The findings of the project will be released in the spring of 2019.By taking the lead on such an important topic as autonomous vehicles, UITP is actively and concretely working to make the integration of autonomous vehicles in public transport a success.\"In a holistic view, it's the land use impact that determines the long-term value\", said our keynote

during the European Council summit today and tomorrow (22-23 March), FoodDrinkEurope is seizing the opportunity of the Single Market\u2019s 25th Anniversary to celebrate the progress it has brought to businesses and citizens at large, at an event tonight in Brussels. \nFoodDrinkEurope also takes this opportunity to publish its Single Market Manifesto , a short overview of the benefits and outstanding challenges of the Single Market for food and drink products. \nUsing testimonies from small and large companies to demonstrate the sector\u2019s commitment to the Single Market, the Manifesto also proposes some policy recommendations to further reinforce what it sees as the most significant achievement of the European Union. \nHubert Weber, FoodDrinkEurope President and President Mondel\u0113z Europe, commented: \u201cFor the EU food and drink sector, the smooth and effective functioning of the Single Market is essential to guarantee growth, jobs and effective service to consumers.

Bessarabia is now part of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe former president Traian Basescu is one of the most vocals supporters of the idea of a union between Romania and Moldova. For example, in mid-January this year, he said the Romanian government should establish a \u201ccountry reunification ministry , adding that he would initiate in the coming parliamentary session a document through which the Parliament expressed its wish to reunite the country with the Republic of Moldova.\nAlso, PNL leader Liviu Orban said last week that Romania is ready for the union with the Republic of Moldova , adding that his party supports this idea.\nMeanwhile, more than 100 localities in the Republic of Moldova signed symbolic declarations of union with Romania, with some Romanian cities also adopting similar declarations.

By way of comparison, Austrian construction output is six times higher than Hungarian, with the same number of employees, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Koji, president of the National Federation of Hungarian Building Contractors (\u00c9VOSZ), told a conference in Budapest. \nIf we compare the construction sector in Hungary with Austria and the Czech Republic - countries of roughly the same size - the figures show a significant difference. Austria reached six times higher production in 2016 with a similar number of employees, while construction output in the Czech Republic was three times greater. \nThe biggest problem is efficiency, said Koji at the conference hosted by business news daily Vil\u00e1ggazdas\u00e1g. In the last 10 years, services and capacities in construction were barely needed, and the sudden growth in demand has caught the sector by surprise, he observed. \nThe current situation on the construction market will force players to improve efficiency, Koji predicted. The value of output in the construction industry reached HUF 2,500 billion last year, which is a nearly 30% increase year-on-year. \nAs for construction prices, these have risen by 5.2%, and by 10-12% for home construction, Koji noted. While it is true that home prices have grown much faster than this rate, the causes for this are not related to the construction sector, he added. \nWhile last year wages in the construction sector grew by 13.1%, this is still not enough to attract a sufficient labor force, which remains the major obstacle to the further expansion of the sector, according to a poll conducted by \u00c9VOSZ.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hungari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u00e1szl\u00f3 koji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vil\u00e1ggazdas\u00e1g", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national federation of hungarian building contractors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:49:19.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8671e1972c57daf619a60f4b55b66f6d6f47cd58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyreUxL3bSFy.RoMYvxSC.oGTf4jc4eHn21XcfX695Ufb00lo17.KM4h7wYkARW3BHYZ7VB_14nvN4nhH7XB7GDoonIILfJOLA-", "site_full": "friss-hirek.hu", "site": "friss-hirek.hu", "site_section": "http://friss-hirek.hu/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Friss-hirek.hu", "title": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "title_full": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "published": "2018-03-23T18:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8671e1972c57daf619a60f4b55b66f6d6f47cd58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyreUxL3bSFy.RoMYvxSC.oGTf4jc4eHn21XcfX695Ufb00lo17.KM4h7wYkARW3BHYZ7VB_14nvN4nhH7XB7GDoonIILfJOLA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T18:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "J\u00f6n a F\u00f6ld \u00f3r\u00e1ja - Budapest is lekapcsol", "text": "Megd\u0139\u0091lt a budapesti hidegrekord a csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160n - Index Google H\u0102\u00adrek - Vezet\u0139\u0091 h\u0102\u00adrek (2 nappal ezel\u0139\u0091tt) - IndexMegd\u0139\u0091lt a budapesti hidegrekord a csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160nIndexA csillag\u0102\u0104szati tavasz kezdet\u0102\u0160n Budapesten megd\u0139\u0091lt a legalacsonyabb maximumh\u0139\u0091m\u0102\u0160rs\u0102\u0160klet rekordja - k\u0102\u015bz\u0102\u015blte az Orsz\u0102\u0104gos Meteorol\u0102\u0142giai Szolg\u0102\u0104lat az MTI-vel. 1964. m\u0102\u0104rcius 20-\u0102\u0104n Budapest Csillagda...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:48:29.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d8051e02239ca3bce74d68c6ac2f16eff12d04a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg97..stVESPcGWHZTj8aWoxAfDSXIg5dsBIMED1FPxi6lB6DjHbyXiRnigB8BjhPfyRIAdM12d21kCaLNDv1FVkJ9s3hXvRGbPFvdAXOf9JFt.1a_1hqm3m", "site_full": "www.portfolio.hu", "site": "portfolio.hu", "site_section": "http://www.portfolio.hu/en/rss/cikkek/all.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "PORTFOLIO.HU - Online Financial Journal", "title": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "title_full": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "published": "2018-03-23T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.portfolio.hu/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14146, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d8051e02239ca3bce74d68c6ac2f16eff12d04a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg97..stVESPcGWHZTj8aWoxAfDSXIg5dsBIMED1FPxi6lB6DjHbyXiRnigB8BjhPfyRIAdM12d21kCaLNDv1FVkJ9s3hXvRGbPFvdAXOf9JFt.1a_1hqm3m", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Festival Atmosphere in Budapest in April 2018", "text": "March 23, 2018, 12:12 pm vision 1/A World Championships with a fan village and gastro area as well.

Photo: VCG Players compete at an esports tournament in Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province in December 2017. Photo: VCG With more capital flowing in and its targeted audience base expanding, the esports industry in China has become more accepted by the market in recent years. Rising as a prospective industry welcomed by youth, esports has formed a complete industrial chain despite the fact that most of its niche markets are still burning money. As such, experts said there are still problems to be tackled, such as industry standardization and guaranteeing esports incorporate mainstream sports values so as to not be perceived as a self-indulgent event. Wen Wen, a Chinese student living in Italy, sits in front of his computer ready to battle it out in the semifinal of the League of Legends tournament with other Chinese students based in the UK, a contest that unfolds in the online world. Representing the University of Manchester, team SSM, which Wen stands for, later entered the final held in London on March 4 and defeated a team representing the University of Cambridge, winning themselves the championship title, though this time, Wen could not actually participate. \"I've played single competitions, group games and semifinals online for SSM, but for the final, it was required of me to actually be present at the gaming spot in London, so unfortunately, I could not be there,\" Wen told the Global Times Tuesday.As an amateur gamer, Wen knows that there is a huge gap between players like him and professionals, who consider entering video game tournaments a career milestone, like a basketball player stepping onto an NBA court for the first time. However, supporting Chinese players like Wen is an ever-growing domestic electronic sports, or esports, industry. Immature but lucrative The industrial chain in China's esports sector has gradually been linked together within recent years, which has involved the development of content licensing parties such as game developers and operators, a rise in the number of competition participants such as teams and hosts, as well as the emergence of communication channels such as livestreaming platforms.Esports, as exemplified in the story above, have become extremely popular among Chinese, with capital continuously swarming into the sector.In fact, the total market capitalization of China's esports sector exceeded 65 billion yuan ($10.26 billion) in 2017, growth of which was mainly bolstered by the rising popularity of esports smartphone apps, according to an industry report released by consulting firm iResearch Inc in January. And that figure is expected to reach 99 billion yuan by 2019.Tech giants like Tencent Holdings, NetEase Inc and Alibaba Group Holding are all fiercely competing to make a foray into the hot esports market.\"In fact, most upstream resources in the esports industry have been in the hands of the internet giants and game developers... They are the big winners,\" Zhang Jiayuan, a partner at Beijing-based Ransenhuizhi Investment Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Taking a market share of 47 percent and 28 percent, respectively, in 2017, Tencent and NetEase have now secured leading positions in terms of channels, content and rule setting, media reports said.Sitting at the top of the gaming hierarchy, esports gather professional video game players who compete in teams to win prize money, with such players usually belonging to large clubs composed of different teams with different preferences and abilities.Zhu Bo, co-founder of Shanghai-based Seeinfront Capital, the parent company of QGHappy Club, told the Global Times on Tuesday that just a few dozen professional clubs are running esports businesses across the country.One of QGHappy's teams, dedicated to playing Tencent's hugely popular game Honor of Kings , won three championships in both the spring and fall season finals of King Pro League (KPL), the game's most prestigious competition, as well as the King Champion Cup, in 2017.\"Like the traditional soccer club, the esports club is represented by its teams' scores and its business capability, since a large proportion of club earnings come from sponsors,\" Zhu said, noting most clubs are currently operating with losses. 'Athletic is core' Professional players are very talented and must take intensive training to maintain a continuous understanding of the game they specialize in, Wen noted. \"Those who can get a stage in the top league and win a prize are rare - it's really hard to get there.\"Compared with traditional sports, it seems hard for people, especially those outside the youth circle, to accept esports as a \"real\" sport, due to the fine line between holding the status of a video game or sport.\"An athletic status should be the core of esports, despite it being based on electronic devices,\" Zhang noted.Alisports, a subsidiary of Alibaba which organizes the World Electronic Sports Games, successfully convinced the Olympic Council of Asia to include esports into the 2022 Asian Games to be held in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang Province.\"Our ultimate goal is to bring esports to the Olympic Games,\" Zhang Dazhong, CEO of Alisports, was quoted as saying in a Xinhua News Agency report published on Monday. A bright future \"Overall, China's esports sector is still at the exploration phase compared with more developed countries like South Korea. But with more capital flowing in, the industry is set to embrace good development opportunities,\" said Zhu, the aforementioned investor.\"Esports belong to an imported culture in China, so it still needs time to be incorporated into the country's mainstream values,\" Zhang noted. \"The professional standards and creativity of gaming teams should be further enhanced,\" she said. \"But you cannot neglect one definite advantage here, that is, the sector's big consumer market, which highly accepts esports.\"According to an IHS Markit research report, China makes up 57 percent of the global esports audience, with about 3.5 billion hours of esports videos viewed and 11.1 billion esports streams delivered in 2017 alone. In November 2017, the final of the League of Legends World Championship was held at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, marking the first time for China to host a major video gaming tournament.Although China did not make the grand final, 40,000 tickets priced up to 1,280 yuan each sold out in minutes. And even scalpers were reportedly reselling them for up to 13,000 yuan each, media reports said.

We intend to bring something to the table that simply doesn\u2019t exist in India today, but is very much warranted for the India of the future,\u201d Raghuram Rajan, former RBI Governor and advisor to the Krea Governing Council, said at a press conference in Mumbai today. \nThe first batch will commence in July 2019, with admissions opening in November this year. The four-year residential undergraduate programmes in Liberal Arts and Sciences will offer immersive learning experiences through real world projects and internships to prepare the students for a holistic approach to face challenges and opportunities. \n\u201cKrea will bring great global and Indian minds together to create an institution of global prominence,\u201d said Jindal. \n\u201cThe fact that so many like-minded and eminent personalities have enthusiastically come together is ample proof of how much the new paradigm is the need of this day,\u201d said former banker and philanthropist N Vaghul, also Chairman of the governing council. \nMahindra, reiterating the value of the university, said Krea\u2019s graduates will undoubtedly be the most sought after candidates both in the corporate world and in other chosen vocations. \nCorporate leaders were unanimous that the university would enable high potential individuals learn to create a positive, catalytic impact ethically in a dynamic and diverse world. \n\u201cKrea University has a unique \u2018interwoven learning\u2019 approach that weaves creativity and action, arts and sciences, theory and practice, Eastern and Western perspectives as also the learnings of the past with the readiness for the future,\u201d said Seshasayee, chairman of the university\u2019s supervisory board.

Abhishek of Vysarpadi was riding the bike back home, after finishing the board exams at his school in north Chennai. P. Raj was riding pillion. \nCrashing into the lorry, the duo was thrown off and came under the wheels of the vehicle, and died on the spot. \nTraffic Investigation Officer Chitra said, \u201cThe parents told us that the boys did not pay heed to their words. At least the school could have prevented them from driving the vehicle to the school premises. The accident could have been prevented.\u201d \nOn March 4, a 17-year-old boy, who was riding a high-end bike, knocked down senior citizen who was walking in Tiruninravur, resulting in his death. \nOn January 12, a 16-year-old boy who took his father\u2019s bike hit a 61-year-old woman in Tirumangalam. She was badly injured. \nCause of snarls \nUnderage driving is a major cause of traffic snarls in the city and causes danger to other motorists and pedestrians on the roads. The menace continues unabated, despite efforts by police to spread awareness among students, schools and parents. \nYoung boys in school uniforms are often found driving high-end bikes in a reckless manner, criss-crossing arterial roads and exhibiting their daredevilry, say police. \nThey hide behind big cars or heavy vehicles to escape the attention of the police at signals. \nSchool girls ride bikes too, but they do not race and are not reckless, police officers said. \nM. Radhakrishnan, co-ordinator of Thozhan Foundation, an non-governmental organisation that works for traffic awareness, said, \u201cMany parents feel proud of their children driving motor vehicles on public roads. They think that if their wards learn to drive a vehicle, they can help in doing household chores by running errands and also drive family members to where they want to go. There are many who buy two-wheelers for their children after they pass Class X and four-wheelers after Class XII. Many parents are not aware of the traffic rule that their wards who are under 18 should not drive any motor vehicle above 50 cc.\u201d \nNot an easy task \nRoad users and activists blame police personnel for their inaction in nabbing errant underage drivers but police personnel have different accounts. \nA traffic police inspector said: \u201cNabbing the minor riding a bike is not an easy task. If we chase them, they may fall or skid. That can result in injuries, even death. Also, juveniles cannot be prosecuted like adults. So most youngsters do not understand the seriousness of the issue at all.\u201d \nGiving various suggestions, Vijay Mehta, secretary of Citizens for Safe Roads, a voluntary organisation, said, \u201cParents are providing vehicles to their school-going children and encouraging them to ride. This is very dangerous behaviour. The heads of schools or educational institutions do not bother about law or safety. Police ask the school authorities to prevent the menace. Schools are a better place to check this practice, not the roads. Their parents can be summoned and prosecuted for the offence.\u201d \nAccident compensation \nV.S. Suresh, an advocate, pointed out that it is usually a Herculean task to get compensation for road accident victims in cases of accidents involving vehicles driven by underage persons. \nOn their part, teachers say parents should also be held responsible. \nAjeeth Prasad Jain, adviser, Chennai Sahodaya Schools, said: \u201cMany students park their vehicles at least half a kilometre away from the school and walk. If they bring the vehicles to school, we certainly will take action against them. Parents must be educated first on this and police should initiate action against the owners of the vehicles.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chitra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. abhishek of vysarpadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p. raj", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ennore express highway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tiruninravur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-22T22:29:56.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ceeb1d46ecf4f99ea24adfcc1b8658c24707f8a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXpRWbKZZiPxvV9jmX_8X26mT_0PetBLV6ihsmPo.8FYiXj3qxy2LhddzN8Z.mr1hpxzAwe8NdokYEvlml0bnzqr_VzOrZvQCyDf0aW_efD5PJnNQgKlr_ERk9Q.GjgOZ8BxoQ3c3K9g--", "site_full": "www.thehindubusinessline.com", "site": "thehindubusinessline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/?service=rss#", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Line - Home", "title": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "title_full": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "published": "2018-03-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/article23325072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BL23STATESCENTRALMUMBAI", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ceeb1d46ecf4f99ea24adfcc1b8658c24707f8a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXpRWbKZZiPxvV9jmX_8X26mT_0PetBLV6ihsmPo.8FYiXj3qxy2LhddzN8Z.mr1hpxzAwe8NdokYEvlml0bnzqr_VzOrZvQCyDf0aW_efD5PJnNQgKlr_ERk9Q.GjgOZ8BxoQ3c3K9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rashmi Pratap", "published": "2018-03-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "text": "Developers offering attractive discounts to woo buyers Mumbai, March 22 \nIndia\u2019s two sought-after living destinations \u2013 NCR and Mumbai \u2013 have been the worst hit by the current real estate meltdown. While property prices in Mumbai have fallen for the first time in recent history, NCR has seen the rates plummeting by 6 per cent since 2015 amid waning investor interest and builders sitting over incomplete projects. \nBengaluru and Hyderabad have seen some appreciation, while in Chennai, the price rise has been less than 5 per cent, according to data from the real-estate consultancy, Liases Foras. \u201cNCR has been the worst affected because investor participation, as well as black money deployment, was very high. Prices were absolutely speculative as Delhi has enormous land availability. Moreover, uninhabitable locations were being sold at high prices. The bubble had to burst,\u201d Pankaj Kapoor, founder and MD, Liases Foras, told BusinessLine . \nAmit Oberoi, National Director at Colliers International, points out that investors made up for almost 50 per cent of the buyers in NCR until 2013. \u201cEven before a project was completed, it was flipped twice or thrice between investors, leading to an increase in rates. These people are no longer participating in the market. So sales are shrinking,\u201d he says. \n\n\nSanjay Sharma, Managing Director of Gurgaon-based real-estate consultancy, Qubrex, says the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has not been effectively implemented in NCR. \u201cHence, that injection of confidence has not happened. In many places, the property is ready but physical and social infrastructure around it has not developed, depressing the prices,\u201d he says. \nMumbai\u2019s woes \nHowever, Mumbai Metropolitan Region\u2019s (MMR) story has been different. The financial capital saw a rapid rise in new launches from 2009 to 2014, with slum rehabilitation projects bringing in new supply. The proposed Navi Mumbai airport fuelled a real estate boom in the twin city and, along with new development beyond the suburbs, led to a supply glut. \n\u201cIn MMR, the unsold inventory is the highest in the country (2,69,230 units or 48 months). An efficient market maintains 8 to 12 months of inventory, indicating a downward pressure on prices,\u201d said Kapoor. Put simply, MMR requires four years to sell off the existing unsold units. \nSamantak Das, chief economist and national director at Knight Frank India, says: \u201cFor the first time, we have seen a fall in quoted/asking price in Mumbai in 2017. The asking rate in Delhi fell in 2016 itself. The effective price discount through waivers in GST, stamp duty and registration is 10 to 12 per cent in Mumbai and 15 to 17 per cent in Delhi.\u201d \nHe points out that while only 10 to 15 per cent of the projects were earlier giving this discount, now about 85 per cent of the projects are doling them out to improve sales. \u201cDevelopers are trying to complete the projects for which they need to clock sales. There is price resistance in Mumbai, and this price has cracked for the first time. This will infuse a lot of demand,\u201d he says. \nEconomic condition \nSharma says the overall economy is slowing down. \u201cThere is not much money with individuals or businesses to invest. As 2019 elections are approaching, the uncertainty in the market will increase and property prices will be in a limbo,\u201d he says. \nKapoor believes that prices will not rise for the next two years. \u201cI don\u2019t see price rise across markets, as prices are still unaffordable and the pace has to grow further for the market to be sustainable,\u201d he says. \nAccording Knight Frank\u2019s affordability index, the price of a house should not be more than 4.5 times the family income. In Mumbai, it is 7.5 times, and even in Gurugram, it is more than 5 times. These indicators point to a long overdue correction in the market and it seems to be happening finally.

According to the space agency, the satellite with a life span of around 10 years will be put into orbit by the Indian rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F08). The rocket is expected to blast off from the second launch pad at the Sriharikota rocket port in Andhra Pradesh at 4.56 p.m., on March 29. The ISRO said that the GSAT-6A was similar to the GSAT-6. The satellite will provide a platform for developing technologies such as demonstration of 6m S-Band Unfurlable Antenna, handheld ground terminals and network management techniques. These are useful in satellite-based mobile communication applications. ISRO Chairman K.Sivan had earlier told IANS that the GSAT-6A would be followed by the launch of navigation satellite which will be in the next fiscal. In the union budget for 2018-19, the Department of Space has been tasked with three earth observation space crafts ready for launch; four Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) flights; one each of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle MkII and Mk III.

He plopped down on his back, smiled like a guy who knew something \u2014 and darn it if he didn\u2019t do a little snow-angel maneuver right there on the court. Richardson completed the four-point play to give the Ramblers a 15-point lead with nearly 17 minutes to go, but maybe that was it right there. Maybe this Elite Eight no-contest was over. Maybe it was over before it even started. Loyola destroyed the major-conference Wildcats 78-62. The Ramblers toyed with them, messed with their minds, stole their souls. By God, Loyola \u2014 for the first time in 55 years \u2014 is going to the Final Four. \nLoyola's Ben Richardson in the midst of his second-half four-point play. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) \nRELATED STORIES Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told \u2018\u2018Chicago, you can be really proud,\u2019\u2019 coach Porter Moser said from the postgame stage at halfcourt, confetti falling. Proud, yes, and thankful, too. Chicago is something of a basketball wasteland nowadays without the 32-5 Ramblers, owners of the most victories \u2014 by three and counting \u2014 in school history. Save the tank talk about the Bulls. Let Northwestern and Illinois fight over the right-now-meaningless moniker of \u2018\u2018Chicago\u2019s Big Ten Team.\u2019\u2019 The Ramblers are Chicago\u2019s Big-Time Team. They\u2019re national darlings. They darn sure deserve to be local treasures. \u2018\u2018Oh, my gosh, yes, these guys deserve that,\u2019\u2019 said a beaming Jerry Harkness, 77, the star of Loyola\u2019s 1962-63 national-championship squad, as players younger by two generations cut down the nets. \u2018\u2018These guys are awesome. I am so proud of them and so happy that I got to be here for this.\u2019\u2019 Les Hunter, 75, the center on that great Ramblers team, shook his head in bewilderment. \u2018\u2018I was hoping they would make another run like this in my lifetime, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see it,\u2019\u2019 he said. Who could have seen all this coming? But the better team \u2014 the much better team \u2014 punched its ticket to San Antonio on a Saturday instantly seared into Ramblers lore. Kansas State coach Bruce Weber wrote two words on the grease board in his locker room before the game: \u2018\u2018toughness\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018discipline.\u2019\u2019 A fat lot of good that did him. \u2018\u2018They were tougher than us from the get-go,\u2019\u2019 Weber said. \u2018\u2018They were physical, very disciplined.\u2019\u2019 They were the team they\u2019ve been all season. Let it be known that Moser\u2019s famous jacket came off sometime in the second half and that Sister Jean, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain, was her lovely, cheerful self before the game. But let\u2019s dispense with the romance for a moment and ponder what once was unthinkable: Loyola isn\u2019t merely back in the Final Four; it has a chance to hold its own there and even run away with the trophy. Have you been watching this tournament? If you have, then you know anything is possible. The Ramblers are going back to Texas, where this incredible Big Dance started. Against Kansas State, they went back to the way they\u2019d started in the first round against Miami: by jumping out to a nice lead and announcing to the world that they belonged and to their opponents that the next two hours were going to be hard as hell. Not even five minutes into the game, the Ramblers led 12-5 and all five starters \u2014 Clayton Custer, Marques Townes, Donte Ingram, Cameron Krutwig and Richardson \u2014 had scored. All game long, they drove and shot with the sort of decisiveness and alacrity that 300 Division I coaches only wish they had on their squad. Another close call? Not a chance. After winning their first three tournament games by a combined four points, the Ramblers said enough. It was time to make an opponent from the big-boy Big 12 suffer. \u2018\u2018We had no answer for them,\u2019\u2019 the Wildcats\u2019 Cartier Diarra said. \u2018\u2018So all credit to them. They are a great team, and hopefully they make it all the way.\u2019\u2019 Next up is Michigan at the Alamodome next Saturday. Chicago\u2019s Big Time Team will be ready. \u2018\u2018When it\u2019s time to lock in, they are locked in,\u2019\u2019 Moser said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s because they want to win; it\u2019s in their genes. They are winning young men.\u2019\u2019 And they\u2019ve won over their city. Moser was sure to give a tip of his Final Four cap to the school paper, which has been there from the beginning. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s been quite a metamorphosis,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018because the Loyola Phoenix was the only one in the press conference for about 20 games.\u2019\u2019 We\u2019re all here now.

Somebody who was senselessly murdered in front of me,\u201d said 18-year-old Samantha Fuentes, who was shot by the gunman Feb. 14. Dworet was a senior at Stoneman Douglas and a competitive swimmer at the high school. He was planning to attend the University of Indianapolis on an athletic scholarship.\nFuentes asked the crowd to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for her friend, and they did.\n\u201cI have been personally affected by the lack of gun control\u201d\nMya Middleton, a 16-year-old student from Chicago, spoke about her own harrowing experience with gun violence. When she was a freshman in high school, Middleton went to pick up some items from the store when an agitated customer began grabbing items and causing a commotion.\n\u201cWhen he finally turns to me, he comes toward me, and I couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t think,\u201d she recalled.\n\u201cHe pulls out this silver pistol and points it in my face and said these words that to this day haunt me and give me nightmares.

Normal to the point where I\u2019ve learned to duck from bullets before I learned how to read,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset going down on South Central. You hear pops thinking they\u2019re fireworks. They weren\u2019t pops.

What they want is an easy win. They want to cast the National Rifle Association as the epitome of evil. An army of children is marching on Washington this weekend, and they want to take semi-automatic rifles away, specifically, the spooky AR-15 rifle.\nIf they were actually serious about gun violence, they\u2019d be talking about places like Chicago and they\u2019d lobby for further regulation of or outright ban on the sale of handguns. Yes, the real numbers actually show rifles are among the safest firearms for an American to own. According to the FBI, Americans are roughly 20 times more likely to die at the end of a handgun.\nYet, handguns are definitively not part of the script the media follows when a mass shooting occurs in America. First, blue check marks start tweeting for gun control while the bodies are still warm. Second come the spin masters like Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun Everytown USA , which got basically the entire media to repeat a wildly false statistic that 18 school shootings had occurred in 2018. Third come the \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d opeds, lately from veterans quick to use their service as a lecturing device.\nFinally, the big brands come out to play.\nWe get scary posts on the AR-15 like this one from a two-time Pulitzer recipient at The New York Times , which notes that \u201c173 people have been killed in mass shootings in the United States involving AR-15s, according to a New York Times analysis.\u201d Of course, the article \u2014 which reads like a less dishonest version of a press release from Everytown \u2014 is missing the context on handguns. How else would they have fit in the swipe at the NRA, the Quote: from a military veteran for gun control, and all the terrifying language about the infantry\u2019s use of AR-15s?\nIf we\u2019re to restrict gun deaths to just mass shootings, according to Statista (which uses the FBI\u2019s methodology), handguns are about twice as likely to be used as rifles . We saw the results of handguns on soft targets in the Ft. Hood and Charleston church shootings. Except that it\u2019s much easier to conceal a handgun, there is virtually no difference between a semi-automatic handgun and a rifle when it comes to attacking a close-quarters, defenseless environment like a school or a church.\nThe \u201c173 deaths since 2007\u201d number is also highly misleading out of context. Roughly four times that number died by gunfire in Chicago in a single year.\nStill, not a word about Chicago gun violence from the media and gun control advocates in this recent cycle, while they loudly claim to be the white knights of gun violence.\nTheir proposed regulations also fit the typical script in that they will have almost no effect on the problem. Raise the age of sales to 21? Average age of a mass shooter is 32. Ban the sale of AR-15s? There are dozens of magazine-fed carbines on the market. Ban the sale of semi-automatic rifles? Most mass shootings occur with handguns.\nNo no, you\u2019ll hear at their march on DC Saturday, their mascot is definitively the AR-15. Mostly because they just have to do something. But the numbers they carry with them are misleading or false. Their propositions, like banning the AR-15, won\u2019t prevent a determined mass murderer.\nBut, they assure you, they\u2019re totally serious about the problem.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "everytown usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T07:04:01.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "358817d80abf3bfcd394e9c980a8153095be1880", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcXRd25KUrf8vmWTadaoicgnEt7j08vZqSOCx2XyeOydbdt4cHQNJ3JcBGz4XhVc7lmaFPjhxVzbZEYX._3bEnaFqJWbPvW1104Sbb6hzMgFKhOwX.zXBXGjSxJpGgWCtOwEHY0eDJZryrX5jXdegA9I42TYEd2F4-", "site_full": "chicago.suntimes.com", "site": "suntimes.com", "site_section": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "title_full": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "published": "2018-03-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/937528560_75244029.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 7113, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1024, "comments": 0, "shares": 1024}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "358817d80abf3bfcd394e9c980a8153095be1880", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcXRd25KUrf8vmWTadaoicgnEt7j08vZqSOCx2XyeOydbdt4cHQNJ3JcBGz4XhVc7lmaFPjhxVzbZEYX._3bEnaFqJWbPvW1104Sbb6hzMgFKhOwX.zXBXGjSxJpGgWCtOwEHY0eDJZryrX5jXdegA9I42TYEd2F4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rick Morrissey", "published": "2018-03-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Final Four-bound Loyola is the Cinderella story that won\u2019t stop being told", "text": "Loyola is going to the Final Four.

Heck, a month ago, they were on the outskirts of Chicago\u2019s consciousness, which generally is where college basketball resides in this city.\nLoyola's Ben Richardson cuts down the net after his team defeated Kansas State on Saturday to earn a trip to the Final Four. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nNow they\u2019re going to San Antonio to play in a national semifinal game against Michigan. It means that everything you think you knew about anything is wrong. If Loyola can be one game from a chance to win an NCAA title, you\u2019d be wise to re-examine your entire life.\nThe Ramblers beat Kansas State 78-62 Saturday in Atlanta, continuing their ridiculously fun ride. Where it will stop, nobody with a working brain knows.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even feel real,\u2019\u2019 guard Ben Richardson said afterward.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t.\nAfter watching Loyola win four games in the tournament, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised anymore. But the Ramblers are an 11 th seed, and no matter how capricious March Madness can be, what they\u2019ve done is still stunning.\nThey\u2019ll beat you any way you want. Where they beat Nevada on Thursday with layups, they beat Kansas State on Saturday with a barrage of three-pointers. Where they won their first three games of the tournament with last-gasp shots, they won Saturday\u2019s game with a relentlessness that built a 23-point lead and then with a steel-reinforced confidence to overcome a Kansas State comeback.\nThe Ramblers do two things very well. They move the ball, and they play hard defense. Throughout the tournament, they have made opponents look slow. That\u2019s not supposed to happen, but they have made a lot of things happen that weren\u2019t supposed to happen. It\u2019s tiring just watching them run around the floor.\nFor the longest time, the ninth-seeded Wildcats couldn\u2019t keep up. And it didn\u2019t look like they had anyone who could score, which in basketball is what is called \u201ca problem.\u201d Then they came roaring back, going on a 14-3 run to cut a 61-38 lead to 64-52 with 4:19 left.\nA lesser team, a team that might have started to believe it didn\u2019t belong \u2013 basically, any team not named \u201cLoyola\u2019\u2019 \u2013 might have caved in. Not this team. The Ramblers bounced back.\nMarques Townes, the hero of the Nevada game, made two free throws and converted a three-point play to push the lead back up to 17. And they stayed the course and played their game and did all the corny things that coaches tell their teams to do. That\u2019s what mature players do.\nThe Ramblers don\u2019t have one big star. They have six lesser stars, and the wattage is superior. When big man Cameron Krutwig backed into the poor guy trying to defend him, it looked like he was using his butt to close the refrigerator door during a late-night raid. The Wildcats didn\u2019t know what to do when he set screens.\nThe Ramblers have point guard Clayton Custer, who has a name like a gunslinger from the Old West and shoots like one, too. They have Richardson, who had a career-high 23 points. Everybody who gets playing time for Loyola can score. The Ramblers shot 57.4 percent from the field and were 9-for-18 on three-point attempts.\n\u201cThe ball usually finds the hot hand,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said.\nNo, it\u2019s not the greatest basketball. It\u2019s not the NBA. But in terms of execution, in terms of setting picks, making the right pass and playing shrink-wrap defense, it\u2019s terrific. In terms of excitement, in terms of gnawed fingernails, shared experiences and school pride, it\u2019s all that\u2019s right with the game.\nThe Ramblers have won 14 straight games and 21 of their last 22. We didn\u2019t see them coming, and we should have. They were exactly the type of team that could do damage in the NCAA Tournament. Five players averaging double figures, two guys who had played high school ball together and a group of people that seemed to err on the side of unselfishness, if there is such a thing as that. That\u2019s what Loyola is, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to San Antonio.\nIt\u2019s the Ramblers\u2019 first trip to the Final Four since 1963, when they won the national championship.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whom they play, even third-seeded Michigan. They\u2019re an 11 th seed and not anything close to an underdog.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable group,\u2019\u2019 coach Porter Moser said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you believe.

But they had a different idea of the problem. Destini Philpot, another student at Baltimore City College, was joined on Saturday in Washington by Carrie Zaremba, a student at the Friends School of Baltimore, a predominantly white Quaker institution. The two said they had helped organize a citywide walkout this month that involved both public and private schools. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a mass shooting in a predominantly white area like Parkland to start caring about gun violence,\u201d Ms. Zaremba said.

Private donors paid for 60 buses that carried around 3,000 Baltimore students to the Washington event. Some Baltimore organizers skipped their city\u2019s satellite march to attend the one in the capital, hoping to reach an audience largely unfamiliar with the kind of violence that visits them with gruesome regularity. One of those organizers, Erricka Bridgeford, has helped work on a campaign called Baltimore Ceasefire, which holds quarterly \u201ccease-fire\u201d weekends that call for a stop to killings for a three-day period. On Saturday, she recalled what had brought her to Washington: the lasting agony from losing her brother, stepson and friends to gun violence. \nAdvertisement   \u201cI\u2019ve seen dead bodies and blood,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are things you never recover from.

DuShon, most affectionately known to many as Connie on NBC\u2019s \u2018Chicago Fire,\u2019 died suddenly Friday morning of natural causes. We are devastated by the loss of a very talented and kindhearted soul. DuShon was a film, television, commercial and voice-over actress who also graced the stages of many Chicago theaters. She brought laughter and joy to many and will be greatly missed. At this difficult time we ask that the privacy of the family and loved ones be respected.\u201d\nEarlier in the evening, TMZ.com reported the actress suffered an apparent heart attack, citing show sources who claimed Miss Brown recently complained of chest pains.\nIn a statement, \u201cChicago Fire\u201d executive producer Dick Wolf said, \u201cThe \u2018Chicago Fire\u2019 family is devastated to lose one of its own.

She\u2019s the mother crazy right there. I think she thinks for the most part, particularly with the younger crew, she\u2019s the sort of maternal, aunt, teacher figure to them.

He was the flight commander charged with landing on the moon. After an oxygen tank exploded, Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise had to call off their mission and figure out how to get back to Earth.\nTwenty-five years later, actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in a Hollywood film about their epic journey.\nApollo 13 astronauts Fred Haise, James Lovell, and John Swigert (left to right) leave a helicopter to step aboard the carrier Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean after their successful recovery. | AP\nWe\u2019d like to give this American hero, who lives in a north suburb of Chicago, a shout-out as he turns 90 Sunday. Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium is celebrating Lovell\u2019s achievements in a yearlong campaign , encouraging space fans to write Lovell notes to let him know what kind of impact his space travels had on them.\nEDITORIAL\nLovell\u2019s name is synonymous with Apollo 13, but we\u2019ll never forget his Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It was the first manned flight to break from the Earth\u2019s orbit and travel around the moon.\nRELATED: Lovell spoke to Sun-Times reporter Robert Herguth about his faith in a podcast last year.\nWe asked author Robert Kurson, whose book \u201cRocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man\u2019s First Journey to the Moon\u201d will be out next month, to give a few good reasons to celebrate Lovell today. Here\u2019s his excellent list:\nJim Lovell donated many of his coolest space-related memorabilia and artifacts to the Adler Planetarium, giving Chicagoans and other visitors an intimate glimpse into the early years of space travel and exploration. He is a wonderful explainer and storyteller who often makes himself available to media and others who are interested in NASA, space, the Moon, and the future of space travel. He is a devoted husband, father and family man who has been married to the same woman, Marilyn, for 65 years. (Astronaut life was notoriously hard on marriages. In fact, the crew of Apollo 8 \u2014 Frank Borman, Lovell, and Bill Anders \u2014 is the only crew from either the Gemini or Apollo programs whose marriages all survived intact.) He is not just one of the nicest astronauts you\u2019ll meet, he\u2019s one of the nicest people you\u2019ll meet, a reputation that goes back to his earliest days with NASA. Unlike some astronauts, he dreamed as a kid of flying on rockets into space and exploring the cosmos, and he seems to have lost little of that boyhood wonder for exploration to this day. He had a golden retriever that liked to watch the Apollo 13 movie when it played on television at his home. Happy Birthday, Commander James Lovell.

Creston police contacted the U.S. Department of State, and the bodies were found during a welfare check at the condo in Tulum, on the Yucatan Peninsula.\nIn Mexico, the Quintana Roo state prosecutors office tweeted that the bodies were found in a tourist compound. The office said that \"no signs of violence were found on the bodies or in the room,\" though authorities said it wasn't immediately clear what caused the deaths. Autopsy reports were pending.\nIowa authorities identified the family as 41-year-old Kevin Sharp; his wife, 38-year-old Amy Sharp; and their children, 12-year-old Sterling and 7-year-old Adrianna.\nReached Friday, the developer of the condo complex where the deaths occurred declined to comment.\nThe Creston News Advertiser newspaper in Iowa reported that the family flew to Cancun, Mexico, on March 14. According to her sister, Amy Sharp texted their mother the next day to say they'd reached Tulum, but relatives hadn't heard from the family since then.\nThe sister, Renee Hoyt, said the Sharps were scheduled to return to the U.S. this week. They were scheduled to depart from the Cancun airport on Wednesday and fly to St. Louis on a non-stop flight. The family had planned to then drive about 200 miles (322 kilometers) to Danville, Illinois, to watch a basketball game Thursday, Hoyt said.\nWhen the family didn't arrive in St. Louis, family members

The exhibition elaborates upon an age of creativity in which symbolism became prominent within the country. \nThe annual presentation from the graduates of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (Kunsthal Charlottenborg, from April 14) will display the work of 26 budding talents who\u2019ve recently completed six years of academic education. Artists will use a variety of mediums including video, film and sculpture. \nLea Gulditte Hestelund is interested in how human bodies are ascribed meaning in contemporary western societies. In her solo exhibition, Consumed Future Spewed Up As Present (Overgaden, from April 7), she explores this topic through mysterious scenarios taken from science-fiction plotlines. \nDanish digital artist Christoffer Birkkj\u00e6r and Portuguese visual artists Duarte Filipe regularly collaborate to explore the intersection between classical drawing and computer visualisation. In their new installation, Even (Overgaden, from April 7), the artists examine landscape features such as mountains, cliffs, rivers and valleys. \nFirst day of the racing season April 6, 18:00; Klampenborg Galopbane, Klampenborgvej 52; 60kr; galopbane.dk Enjoy the fun and competitive spirit of Klampenborg Racetrack as it begins its 2018 season.

So it was perhaps a little surprising when the former minister, Helge Sander, and former bank boss Lars Seier Christensen floated the idea of bringing a Formula 1 grand prix to the streets of the capital. \nREAD ALSO: Copenhagen looking to host a Danish Grand Prix in 2020 This has now come a step closer. As a result of a request from the finance minister, Kristian Jensen, on Thursday this week, the idea was debated by the city council\u2019s Borgerrepr\u00e6sentationen. A slim majority consisting of Socialdemokratiet, Dansk Folkeparti, Venstre, Konservative and Liberal Alliance voted to enter into a dialogue with the government regarding the plan, reports DR Nyheder. Minimising the damage However, there are strings attached. \u201cIt is dependent on a number of conditions, amongst which are that it should not cost Copenhagen\u2019s taxpayers a penny,\u201d said Copenhagen\u2019s mayor Frank Jensen. The state will have to become a formal partner in the project and the municipality must not incur any extra expense. In addition, the inconvenience such an arrangement will cause must be minimised. On top of that, the race should be open to all and create job opportunities in Copenhagen. Not so green, perhaps One of the parties that voted against the plan is Enhedslisten. \u201cWe believe that Copenhagen should have a green profile. We would like to attract the tourists and companies that come to the city because of that,\u201d said Ninna Hedeager Olsen, the deputy mayor for technical and environmental matters. As far as the timeframe for a possible grand prix goes, it could take place in 2020 or 2021 if all the conditions are met.

The division is growing fast and is characterised by collegial, energetic staff and strong research collaborations with leading universities and industry worldwide. \nOur research focuses on understanding and improving the ways in which complex sociotechnical engineering systems are designed, managed, and operated throughout their life cycles. Our research spans the boundaries of 1. interdisciplinary engineering design, 2. engineering project, program and portfolio management, and 3. related policy, public engagement and strategic processes. By focusing on the themes of complexity, human behaviour, and uncertainty, we develop understanding, knowledge, methods and tools for public and private organisations to be more effective in the design, construction and operation of large-scale socio-technical engineering systems. Examples include applications in healthcare (e.g. development and integration of transformative technologies) or energy generation and distribution (e.g. design of industry cooperation networks). We believe that good design can deliver widespread benefits to society\u2019s challenges of health and wellbeing in the 21st century. \nThe Post-Doctoral Research Associate will be working in healthcare systems research at the intersection of design, technology, human behaviour, and health research. He/she will take a leading role in driving the research in healthcare system design forward, by engaging in the relationship between design and wellbeing, by bringing a systems perspective to health and care services, and thus by designing for life. \nKeywords include healthcare systems design, healthcare design, design for behaviour change, personalised health technologies, collaborative care, healthcare innovation, eHealth, Digital Health, healthcare analytics, behaviour monitoring, user-friendly and accurate visualisation of healthcare data. \nResponsibilities and tasks Technology is transforming healthcare. We are moving from centralised hospital care towards a more distributed connected care model that is widely accessible, personalised and collaborative. Mobile health applications and wearable sensing are empowering patients (and healthy users) to track and manage their own health, wellbeing and lifestyles. Data from medical and health/welfare technology can help care providers to understand and visualize trends, broadening their focus from diagnosis and treatment to prediction and prevention. The healthcare data landscape in Denmark is rich and accessibility for researchers among the best in the world. \nThe Post-Doctoral Research Associate is interested in leveraging technology both in the ways we conduct healthcare research and in the ways design can help to develop, adapt, and integrate technology and mobile health solutions into healthcare. The Post-Doc will have the opportunity to work in close connection with and build on ongoing university-hospital collaborative research on the adaptation and implementation of technology in cognitive rehabilitation, for active ageing, and for chronic disease management, with the long-term vision of improving the design of health care systems for connected and collaborative care. \nOverall, our healthcare research takes an engineering systems design perspective to integrate people, processes, and technology for more effective, personalised, collaborative, connected, and sustainable healthcare delivery and -improvement. We are motivated by the opportunities offered through the accelerating pace of technological innovation to ease the increasing burden of chronic disease. With a human-centric focus, we study how innovative technology and processes may be woven into existing health and care systems to improve treatment as well as early diagnosis and prevention. Our objectives are to develop conceptual design frameworks for healthcare improvement and to apply these frameworks to the real-life health and care challenges of our society, be it in the general population or in patient groups via collaborations with clinicians. Our ambitions are to provide both better and more cost-effective health care. In particular, all of our current projects aim to push the boundaries of how the interaction between people and novel Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), mobile-, and wearable technologies can help re-model care practices, especially in the fields of mental health, elderly care and active ageing, and hypertension. \nOne of our projects is exploring how wearables might be adapted to match the needs and capabilities of the dementia care network, how technologies and data might be used to understand patient behaviour and support clinical research, and how these findings can reinforce or rethink current care practices. Another of our initiative is related to the Stanford Medicine X Precision Research Challenge, for which we have been selected as one six finalists worldwide and enabled us to pursue a pilot study with more than 50 elderly participants enrolled. Another project explores how personalisation, patient apprenticeship/situated learning, and shared-decision making between patient and providers may promote behavioural change in hypertensive patients towards their increased engagement in therapy. The project will develop a conceptual healthcare design framework applied to the design, implementation and field trial of an ICT-solution for collaborative hypertensive care. \nSpecific tasks include the dissemination of knowledge in the form of peer-reviewed journal and conference contributions and the focus on acquisition of research funding for the group. \nThe Post-Doc will be working with partners from academic, health and industrial sectors. In particular, researchers from the Engineering Systems Division are active members of the Copenhagen Center for Health Technology ( cachet.dk ), connecting with researchers from other DTU Departments, health researchers from the Copenhagen University, representatives from the Municipality of Copenhagen and the Capital Region, neuropsychologists, doctors, nurses, patient organisations, caregivers and patients, and many more. The Post-Doctoral Research Associate will enter and continue to build health and care research and industry relationships across DTU, Denmark, and worldwide. \nQualifications Candidates should have a PhD degree or equivalent. \nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project means that applicants from a broad range of technical backgrounds will be considered. Applicants should have (or expect to obtain by the start date) a PhD degree, preferably in design, design engineering, engineering, computer or systems science, health sciences, computational social science, etc. Preference will be given to those candidates with a high level of English (and also Danish language skills) who can demonstrate an aptitude for conceptual and empirical work, modelling and programming, and the confidence to network within academic, public, and commercial organisations. \nFurther qualifications include: Excellent scientific dissemination skills and passion for writing.

The 22-year-old Mendez rallied in the closing stage of the 1.9K swim, 90K bike, 21K run event to beat three-time Philippine Ironman 70.3 champion Tim Reed and Tim Van Berkel. \u201cThat was a hard battle,\u201d said Mendez, the reigning Xterra world champion. \u201cI was in second place until the final 13 kilometers. The effort was just too hard.\u201d From fifth in the opening swim part, Mendez worked his way up in the bike stage then outlasted his veteran rivals in the grueling run event to nail his first Ironman 70.3 victory in 3:50:32. Reed clocked 3:52:26 to finish second while Van Berkel came in third in 3:53:45 followed by five-time world champion Craig Alexander, also of Australia (3:56:24) and Bradley Weiss of South Africa (3:58:37). But while Mendez needed to unleash a strong finishing kick to snare the crown, Kahlefeldt dominated the women\u2019s pro side and completed a wire-to-wire triumph in 4:25:38. She came out on top in the swim leg then sustained her charge in the bike and run, posting a more than 11-minute victory for her sixth career championship. Japanese Naomi Washizu took runner-up honors in 4:36:53 while many-time Philippine triathlon champion Dimity Lee Duke settled for third in 4:39:12. Lisa Tyack, also from Australia, clocked 4:41:01 and placed fourth in her first pro race while Kirralee Seidel, also from Down Under, timed 4:53:04 for fifth in the event held in Mindanao for the first time in a decade of triathlon staging by Sunrise Events, Inc. Mendez still trailed Reed in the early part of the run stage but grabbed the lead in the last seven kms and stayed ahead all the way to the finish. \u201cWhen I passed him, I never looked back,\u201d said Mendez. Reed rued dropping his bottle of power drink off his bike in one of the humps and opted not to stop to get it back in fear of losing precious time. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to stop,\u201d said Reed who also thanked countryman Berkel for sparing a couple of (power) gels. Rounding out the top 10 of the elite pros were South Africa's Bradley Weiss (3:58:37) and Kyle Buckingham (4:01:43), Australians Sam Betten (4:03:36), Eric Watson (4:13:59) and Ben Allen (4:18:08) and Canada's Brent McMahon (4:20:38). Jorry Ycong emerged as the top Filipino finisher in the race that generated so much interest and a monstrous traffic in and around the city on race day. He locked 4:24:15, followed in the Filipino elite category by August Benedicto (4:25:02), Banjo Norte (4:25:07), Jumalil Paul (4:36:24) and Benjamin Rana (4:40:42).

Jeeves de Veyra MANILA -- Besides celebrating World Macaron Day on Saturday by giving away free macarons to their customers, Bizu Patisserie also launched four new macaron flavors for the summer.\nThis French confection has garnered a following in the Philippines, thanks in large part to Bizu, which helped popularize macarons in the early 2000s. Whether eating them with tea or coffee, or on their own, these melt-in-your-mouth treats are always a delight, especially now that they come in local flavors.\nThe Malagos Chocolate macaron uses 65% dark chocolate from Davao, creating a great interplay of sweet and slightly bitter -- ideal for those that like it not too sweet.\nWith local cheese and white chocolate ganache sandwiching yellow almond meringue discs, the Queso Macaron has a very light cheese flavor.\nThe Ube Macaron, meanwhile, has purple and white discs, and a dark violet Bohol yam infused buttercream filling. Ube is the world\u2019s flavor de jour of the moment, and Bizu\u2019s macaron is unapologetically ube\u2014a great representation of our favorite local yam.\nLast but not the least, fans of Davao\u2019s pungent fruit will love the Durian Macaron. With durian-infused buttercream, one can tell Bizu didn\u2019t scrimp on the flavor with just a whiff.\nThese summer macarons will only be available until April 31.\n ", "highlightText": "",

(Photo: KUSA-TV, Denver) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE DENVER \u2014 A Colorado school district will transition from a five-day week to a four-day week beginning in August. Brighton-based School District 27J announced Monday the four-day week will entice quality teachers and allow for the allocation of resources to items more critical to the district's \"primary purpose.\" \"We're confident it's going to attract teachers and keep them,\" District 27J Superintendent Chris Fiedler said. \"I haven't had teachers say that this is a horrible idea.\" Other hopes for the four-day week are that it will \"reorganize and create time to support teacher development and preparedness,\" create a school calendar that increases instructional time and is \"clean, clear and concise making it less difficult for families to manage.\" \u201cI realize this will be a significant change for our students, their families, and the communities we are so fortunate to serve, but our district can no longer be expected to do more with less financial resources,\u201d the release continued. The new schedule follows the district's six failed attempts to get more money through bond elections. With the new change, Fiedler said they hope to save around $1 million in three key areas. By not running school buses on the days with no classes, he said the district estimates to save around $700,000. School District 27J plans to tack on a couple hundred thousand more dollars by not paying for substitute teachers. The final big saving, Fiedler said, would come from utility costs, but it's unclear how much that might be. While the school district plans on saving money, some parents will have to pay a little more for child care. Fiedler said the district offers child care services on the days kids won't be in school. It costs $30 a day which he admits isn't as great as the option parents currently have when their students are in class. More: Hey, boss: Moms get it done. Here's how to keep them around The district has picked Monday as the day kids won't have class. \"We really feel like Monday is the day to prepare and to be better for kids,\" Fiedler said. \"This will give people a chance to have a weekend and then come in on Monday \u2014 whether they're paid to or not because they're doing that work anyway to be prepared for kids and to be better for kids.\" Teachers will still have to work on one Monday of each month, however, it will only be half a day.

The Dolphins head coach has played a big part in Osweiler's development during the quarterback's first three years in the league (2012-14). During Osweiler's rookie year in Denver, Gase was the Broncos ' quarterbacks coach. In 2013, Gase was promoted to offensive coordinator, which was his role in Denver until he left to take the same job with the Bears in 2015. \nWith the Dolphins, Osweiler will likely provide insurance for Ryan Tannehill , who has had some trouble staying healthy over the past two years. The Dolphins starting quarterback has suffered a total of two ACL injuries over the past two seasons and it's still unclear when he might be 100 percent. Tannehill has only played in 13 of 32 regular season games over the past two seasons. \nOsweiler is coming to Miami from Denver, where he spent the 2017 season. Although the terms of Osweiler's deal haven't been released, we can probably safely assume the numbers will be nowhere close to the contract he received after leaving Denver following the 2015 season. \nIn March 2016, Osweiler signed a massive four-year, $72 million contract with the Texans that included $37 million in guaranteed money. After an ugly year in Houston, the Texans unloaded Osweiler (and his contract) in a March 2017 trade that sent him to Cleveland. However, Osweiler never actually played a regular season game with the Browns in 2017 because he was cut before the regular season started . \nThe 27-year-old quarterback visited with the Dolphins on Thursday and Miami clearly liked him enough that they didn't let him leave the building. With both Jay Cutler and Matt Moore no longer on the roster, the Dolphins were in desperate need of a quarterback. \nOsweiler, who was a second round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft , has a 13-12 career record as a starter after going 0-4 with the Broncos last season. With Osweiler on board in Miami, the Dolphins could still draft a quarterback this year , but Gase may have brought the veteran in so he doesn't feel forced to make a pick for a QB in April.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam gase brock osweiler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan tannehill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam gase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osweiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:04:48.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79bd0446b61e500a505973a80eaaebd6a87dba0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bm_w_dC_byE8kjeeQbIOUDXhe_L3psUmT9okT02FFmiA_kL6KQV4gO5.oaqYrq6jpOgno0JS.eqDK3wMN8kK4PvgjR32sIU0O5etnAkyKRxed3_tofdaeoLT2jgBCKPpC7R4sGUH6lcqm0LS1O4xrtTRIh6zXt8g-", "site_full": "www.breitbart.com", "site": "breitbart.com", "site_section": "http://www.breitbart.com/news/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Posts - Breitbart", "title": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "title_full": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/gavel-law-courtroom-flickr.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1051, "comments": 0, "shares": 1051}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79bd0446b61e500a505973a80eaaebd6a87dba0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bm_w_dC_byE8kjeeQbIOUDXhe_L3psUmT9okT02FFmiA_kL6KQV4gO5.oaqYrq6jpOgno0JS.eqDK3wMN8kK4PvgjR32sIU0O5etnAkyKRxed3_tofdaeoLT2jgBCKPpC7R4sGUH6lcqm0LS1O4xrtTRIh6zXt8g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ben Kew", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to 'Islamic Jihad Union'", "text": "Denver Tries Uzbek Refugee on Charges of Wiring Money to \u2018Islamic Jihad Union\u2019 Blogtrepreneur/Flickr by Ben Kew 23 Mar 2018 0\n The trial for a refugee from Uzbekistan charged with providing material support to a terrorist organization by wiring money to the \u201cIslamic Jihad Union\u201d (IJU) began in Denver, Colorado, on Thursday. Prosecutors claim Bahktiyor Jumaev developed a closeness with fellow Uzbek Jamshid Muhtorov when the pair shared an apartment and that the two men discussed joining the IJU through phone calls and emails by using code words such as \u201cwedding\u201d to describe jihad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime to send money or property to a terrorist organization,\u201d said prosecutor Gregory Holloway at a courthouse in Denver. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nIn 2011, prosecutors say Jumaev sent $300 to Jamshid Muhtorov and later admitted to FBI agents that he knew it was going towards the IJU.\nHowever, Jumaev\u2019s attorney David Barry Savitz argued that the FBI illegally extracted a false confession from him by arresting him after a night\u2019s work and interrogating him for three hours.\nHe went on to claim that his client merely intended to pay back Muhtorov for a $500 bond required to get Jumaev out of jail and was not related to the IJU.\n\u201cHe considered himself trapped. He was scared. He was exhausted,\u201d Savitz said in his opening statement. \u201cIt was strictly intended to pay his debt and has nothing to do with the IJU.\u201d\nThe FBI\u2019s tough questioning allegedly reminded Jumaev of an experience he had in 1999 where Uzbekistan National Security agents questioned him before severely beating him.\nIn January, Jumaev\u2019s lawyers asked a judge not to allow the prosecution to show jurors a video showing the beheading of FBI agents found on Muhtorov\u2019s computer.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Mr. Jumaev viewed any or most of the Muhtorov electronic evidence, particularly the most violent ones,\u201d the motion read.\nMuhtorov was first arrested before boarding a flight in Chicago back in 2012 and is currently being tried separately. He has already served five years in jail without trial, and a decision last year to release him on bail was eventually reversed by a federal judge.\nThe men are two of a number Uzbek migrants charged with terrorism-related offenses in the past year. Last August, 22-year-old Uzbek-American Abror Habibo pled guilty to charges of agreeing to fund terrorist activity, after buying another man a plane ticket to Syria in order to join the Islamic State.\nUzbek migrant Sayfullo Saipov also faces charges of terrorist after carrying out a truck attack that killed eight people and injured at least a dozen others in the city\u2019s deadliest attack since 9/11.\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook , Twitter at @ben_kew , or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\n Jihad , National Security , Bahktiyor Jumaev , jihad , terrorism , Uzbeki , Uzbekistan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99", "https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/crime/prosecutors-in-denver-trial-uzbek-native-used-codes-to-hide-terror-payment", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2018%2F03%2F23%2Fdenver-tries-uzbek-refugee-charges-wiring-money-islamic-jihad-union%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Denver+Tries+Uzbek+Refugee+on+Charges+of+Wiring+Money+to+%E2%80%98Islamic+Jihad+Union%E2%80%99", "https://twitter.com/ben_kew", "https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/?skip_nax_wizard=true", "https://www.denverpost.com/2018/03/22/terror-trial-denver-federal-court-bakhtiyor-jumaev/", "https://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/25/jamshid-muhtorov-detained-until-trial/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gregory holloway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahktiyor jumaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamshid muhtorov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben kew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jumaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david barry savitz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "denver tries uzbek refugee on charges of wiring money to 'islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "denver tries uzbek refugee on charges of wiring money to \u2018islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "islamic jihad union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uzbekistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:15:59.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5238f70ba9d7f9bd373fd2434a9449355525816f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbHLM_VB4kxeN.A.jA6tgLo.YJg0z_t_K72QpgdasRkWPuf66HKR7J6b_0AZdn7xslFOeN6YkOeoL.c6pSd9slBpi4JZd8236GbdSylIf4jiSHktt7fIlkeIhH6G3YpJ8nzmB5_DF1uhwe9SQveb_NhBXrCP4O6TqV", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/sports/horseracing/\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "L.A.

Venzor-Gonzalez had escaped custody from Denver Sheriff Department deputies during a medical transport Monday morning.\nVenzor-Gonzalez was not in the car.\nInstead, officers killed 27-year-old Steven Nguyen and wounded 23-year-old Rafael Landeros in the shooting, Archer said Thursday.\nEven though police shot the wrong person, Archer declared the shooting was justified because the officers reasonably believed they were pursuing Venzor-Gonzalez. The people in the car did not follow officers\u2019 orders and appeared to be searching for something as officers yelled for them to show their hands, she said.\n\u201cOfficers knew that Venzor-Gonzalez had been arrested in November for attempting to kill a police officer,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThey believed the actions being made inside the car were efforts to locate a weapon. So fearing for their safety the officers fired.\u201d\nThe shooting, which happened near East 40th Avenue and Albion Street, remains under investigation by the Denver District Attorney, Denver police and Aurora Police Department. District Attorney Beth McCann ultimately decides whether a police shooting is justified under state law. The police department\u2019s internal affairs bureau will investigate whether officers followed department policies in the pursuit and shooting and why the men in the car had been incorrectly identified.\nMeanwhile, Venzor-Gonzalez remains on the lam. Police consider him to be dangerous, and a manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies is ongoing. Venzor-Gonzalez engaged in a shootout with a Denver police officer in November after a car chase.\nAt the time, Venzor-Gonzalez was wanted for abducting a woman and her toddler. During the shootout, Venzor-Gonzalez was struck multiple times and was at-large for two days before police found him inside an Aurora home with high-powered weapons.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very dangerous individual,\u201d Archer said. \u201cHe remains our top priority.

When the SUV stopped, officers ordered the occupants to show their hands. The occupants ignored them, Archer said. Officers fired their guns.\nThe car then rolled down an embankment, and officers said they could see the occupants continuing to look for something.

The Browns subsequently cut the quarterback before the year began. He landed back in Denver, starting four games and completing just 55.8 percent of his passes for just 6.3 yards per toss with five touchdowns and five interceptions. \nThe Dolphins are in the market for a backup behind Ryan Tannehill , with both Matt Moore and Jay Cutler no longer under contract. Miami currently has David Fales and Brandon Doughty on the depth chart. Miami also is rumored to be interested in using a draft pick on a quarterback who could potentially take over for Tannehill down the road. \nAt this stage, Osweiler has proven to be a backup quarterback.

They've been doing it for years, and are good for one every few months. That said, this week it released a new one, this time using the hype to highlight its PlayStation 4 exclusive line-up. \nLike past videos, the new one clips together footage of multiple games -- complimented by hype-inducing music and big text -- all showing off a range of games Sony is \u00e2\u0080\u009cproud to say are only on PlayStation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nIf you seen one of these trailers, you've seen them all. This specific one includes both games already available exclusively on the platform, as well as ones slated to hit it soon. The following games are spotlighted: Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Detroit: Become Human , The Last of Us Part II, God of War , Days Gone, Shadow of the Colossus, Gran Turismo Sport, The Inpatient, Concrete Genie, Dreams, Blood and Truth, Hidden Agenda, and Bravo Team. \nAs you would expect, there was no love for the PlayStation Vita, and only a little bit of love for PlayStation VR, with much of the hype-train powered by PS4 games. \nWhether there is meaning behind the absence of games like Death Stranding, Wild , or Ghost of Tushima , is hard to say. There could be a calculated reason for their absence, or none at all. After all, other games such as Moss and Persona 5 are also missing, as well as many other titles. \nNonetheless, the purpose of the video is to simply build some marketing hype, which it successfully does. And given that Sony has Detroit: Become Human, God of War, Spider-man , and more coming this year, it has a reason to be excited. 0 comments \nPersonally, of Sony's line-up I'm looking forward to God of War the most. The combination of everything I've seen looking impressive and the huge marketing push from Sony has me excited and anticipating a game of game of the year material. \nGiven that's already almost April, this very well might be the last hype video we see before E3 in June, which is fine, the more hype saved for E3 the better.

(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) GM may be considered a front-runner on electrification today, but it\u2019s clear the institutional knowledge spans decades, said Greg Wallace, who has helped develop the collection over the past two decades as manager. (On this day, he was filming segments for the History Channel.) A study in innovation \"The collection tells a story of the history of the automobile and our fascination with car culture,\" said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, the world's leading classic car insurer based in Traverse City. \"You're actually able to study the thinking and innovation of the company and see how things were applied or not applied to production vehicles.\" Oh, and those Smart micro cars that tuck neatly into puny parking spaces in New York and San Francisco?

Built to be an urban two seater with fiberglass body and steel chassis, it utilized special Delco-Remy lightweight lead-acid batteries taking 7 hours on a complete recharge from a 115-volt household outlet. The car\u00d5s range at 25 miles an hour is 58 miles. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) Visitors learn that the word \u201ccranky\u201d comes from drivers in the early 1900s having a bad day crank-starting the car. The crankshaft would kick back and break a thumb or a wrist and, on occasion, come out of the crank hold and hit the operator in the head, Wallace said. Vehicles from the 1900s have headlight covers that open to reveal a lantern wick inside. Steering wheels in 1912 were on the right, not left. (Ford put so many steering wheels on the left side that eventually everyone else did too, Wallace pointed out.) Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, said classic car junkies can't help but savor trips to the Heritage collection. \"All of the significant show cars are there \u2013 the Y-Job, the Le Sabre, the Firebirds \u2013 as well as the company\u2019s iconic production cars \u2013 the Tri-Five Chevys, the 1959 Cadillac, the split-window 1963 Corvette, the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am Special Edition,\" he said. \"But there\u2019s also a strong collection of technologically significant cars \u2013 not as flashy but equally important.\" The first V8! Cars like the 1912 Cadillac, the first auto with an electric starter; the 1915 Cadillac, with the first mass-produced V8 engine; and the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, the first front-wheel drive American car since the 1930s. The first electric starter meant people of smaller stature, who lacked upper body strength, could start cars for the first time on their own. And the V8 engine created a new industry standard for more powerful vehicles.

In 1912, Cadillac won the Dewar trophy for the electric starter and electric lights.

Cars like the Corvette made GM\u2019s image, but cars like the Chevette made its bottom line.\" In the beginning, the goal was just to try and preserve history, Wallace said. \"I had no idea it would turn into what it has,\" he explained. \"Once history is gone, it's gone. I wanted to make sure we could tell our story down the road.\" Now visitors can track a nation's highs and lows, changes and progress. \"You can see prosperity and optimism through the '40s, then where the industry was in hiatus from '42 to '47 for the war and then it all starts back up again. Wealth and prosperity was growing,\" said Mike Simcoe, vice president of global design for GM. \"You see the industry wrestling with the change of fuel economy targets in the late '70s, with more stringent safety requirements, crash requirements, and the way some of those regulations were applied and how it impacted the structure of the vehicles. The '80s were an odd period, in fashion and style generally. I can say this in confidence, I have photos of myself.\" Unlikely to be public Some visitors whisper their desire to see the GM collection turned into a public exhibit on the Detroit riverfront one day, a stone's throw from the company's world headquarters in the Renaissance Center. \"It would be amazing,\" said Eddie Alterman, editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine. \"At the height of its power, GM was seen as the trailblazer \u2014 the Tesla of its time. And the company continues as an innovation leader in ways people don\u2019t fully appreciate.\" The vehicles are so carefully maintained and protected that there's no plan to make the exhibit public, though it can be reserved for group tours, conferences and special events. Despite being a secret, 300-plus events and tours were held in 2017.

The Channel 7 veteran, whose contract was not renewed by the Detroit station, was choked up as she signed off for her final noon newscast. So was meteorologist Hally Vogel, who was delivering the weather for the noon news. \"JoAnne, you are a wonderful person, coworker, friend. And just to say you will be missed is a sore understatement,\" said Vogel, fighting back tears. \"We truly love you and are going to miss you.\" Broadcasting from Channel 7's glass booth inside the downtown Detroit Qube building, Purtan briefly thanked her friends and colleagues at the station and, in particular, all of the people watching at home. \"I thank you for inviting me into your homes for the last 20 years and, by the way, for all the heartfelt sentiments and well wishes on social media,\" she said. \"I want you to know I have read each and every comment on my Facebook page. I am truly grateful for, really, your love and support.\" Purtan posted March 9 on her Facebook page that she would be leaving the E.W. Scripps-owned television station because of corporate restructuring. Scripps has been making job cuts across its media properties. Her social media announcement was flooded with 5,300 Facebook responses representing a wave of disappointment and anger that Channel 7 was not renewing her contract. \"No way! What a mistake WXYZ! Joanne \u2014 you have always been my favorite \u2014 and the best female anchor \u2014 always a lady with class! WXYZ will lose me as a news viewer now,\" wrote Bevery Grau. An Emmy-winning anchor and reporter who juggled several duties at the station, Purtan also co-anchored \"The Now Detroit\" 4 p.m. newscast, served as a consumer reporter for \"Don't Waste Your Money\" segments and provided weekly profiles of local female entrepreneurs for \"Mom's a Genius\" segments.

As a prominent Detroit TV figure, she joined the family media tradition of her father, iconic Motor City radio deejay Dick Purtan. Earlier this month, her father shared his pride for his daughter's career and his feelings about her departure on his official Facebook page. \"This is a speed bump in a wonderful career \u2014 and her mother and I have no doubt that there will be much smooth sailing for her down the road,\" he wrote. Facebook | @Dick Purtan's Official Fan Page Dick Purtan's Official Fan Page And with her on-air goodbye, Purtan told viewers she would keep them posted about her future. In her March 9 Facebook post, she indicated she plans to remain in metro Detroit. \"I'm excited about what the future has to bring, but I will particularly miss this time together over the lunch hour every day,\" Purtan concluded. \"Thank you for watching and God bless.\" Contact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.

(Fox News) President Trump retained the law firm diGenova & Toensing this week to represent him in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election, sources told Fox News on Thursday. Reports this week suggested Joseph diGenova had joined Trump\u2019s outside legal team, alongside Jay Sekulow, but a source confirmed to Fox News that his wife and law partner, Victoria Toensing, also would represent the president. \nToensing served as deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the Justice Department under the Reagan administration, and as an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit. Toensing was chief counsel for then-Sen. Barry Goldwater, who sat as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \ndiGenova and Toensing, together, were appointed by the House of Representatives in 1997 as special counsel to investigate the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The two also were retained to investigate former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the Democrat's political surveillance controversy, also known as Troopergate. Victoria Toensing reacts to indictment in Uranium One case \nThere have been concerns of a potential conflict of interest with diGenova and Toensing representing the president in Mueller\u2019s investigation, after Toensing\u2019s representation of former key witnesses in the probe. \nRecently, Toensing represented Mark Corallo, an ex-spokesman to former Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz, in his interview with the special counsel\u2019s team. Toensing also represented Sam Clovis, a 2016 Trump campaign associate who supervised George Papadopoulos, in Clovis' Mueller interview. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the FBI as part of the special counsel\u2019s probe. Toensing also represented Erik Prince, a former informal adviser to Trump, who allegedly attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in Seychelles, that Mueller reportedly is investigating. \nBut Corallo told Fox News on Thursday there was no conflict of interest. \n\u201cI signed a waiver acknowledging I see no potential conflicts with their representation of the President,\u201d Corallo told Fox News in an email on Thursday, explaining it was a \u201cstandard\u201d waiver of \u201cpotential conflict.\u201d \nA source close to diGenova and Toensing told Fox News that Corallo, Clovis and the president signed a waiver. \n\u201cThe conflict is owned by the client. The conflict privilege is owned by the client,\u201d the source told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s the clients who have the privilege to waive. And the president waived it too.\u201d Toensing: FBI, DOJ sought to clear Clinton, frame Trump \nThe source told Fox News that when one attorney at a firm is retained, the entire firm is retained, and when one attorney has a conflict, the entire firm as a conflict, pointing to Ted Olson. \n\u201cIf one lawyer has a conflict, they all do. Ted Olson, who wanted to join the team couldn\u2019t\u2014his law firm represents Fusion GPS,\u201d the source said. \nOlson, a former solicitor general, was invited to join the president\u2019s legal team but declined, a source with knowledge of the outreach told Fox News. Olson's firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Fusion GPS\u2014the research firm behind the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier. \nThe news of Toensing\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s team came after the president\u2019s lead attorney John Dowd resigned, and Trump \u201cgraciously accepted.\u201d \nDowd had voiced strong opposition to the president doing an interview with Mueller. \nBut on Thursday, when Trump was asked if he wanted to testify before the special counsel\u2019s team, the president responded, \u201cYes. I would like to. I would like to.\u201d \nFox News\u2019 John Roberts contributed to this report. \nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter at @brookefoxnews .

It\u2019s been going on my entire life.\u2019\u2019 \nPresident Donald Trump was in Florida for the weekend. A motorcade took him to his West Palm Beach golf club in the morning. As of early afternoon, he had yet to weigh in on Twitter about the protests. Advertisement \nThe NRA went silent on Twitter in the morning, in contrast to its reaction to the nationwide school walkouts against gun violence March 14, when it tweeted a photo of an assault rifle and the message \u2018\u2018I'll control my own guns, thank you.\u2019\u2019 \nAbout 30 gun-rights supporters staged a counter-demonstration in front of FBI headquarters in Washington, standing quietly with signs such as \u2018\u2018Armed Victims Live Longer\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Stop Violating Civil Rights.\u2019\u2019 Other gun-control protests around the country were also met with small counter-demonstrations. \nOrganizers of the big rally in the nation\u2019s capital hoped their protest would match in numbers and spirit last year\u2019s women\u2019s march, which far exceeded predictions of 300,000 demonstrators. \n\u2018\u2018We will continue to fight for our dead friends,\u2019\u2019 Delaney Tarr, another survivor of the Florida tragedy, declared from the stage. The crowd roared with approval as she laid down the students\u2019 central demand: a ban on \u2018\u2018weapons of war\u2019\u2019 for all but warriors. \nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 9-year-old granddaughter Yolanda Renee King gave a rousing speech at the Washington rally, drawing from the civil rights leader\u2019s most famous words. \n\u2018\u2018I have a dream that enough is enough,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That this should be a gun-free world. Period.\u2019\u2019 \nIn Parkland, the police presence was heavy as more than 20,000 people filled a park near the school, chanting slogans such as \u2018\u2018Enough is enough\u2019\u2019 and carrying signs that read \u2018\u2018Why do your guns matter more than our lives?\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Our ballots will stop bullets.\u2019\u2019 \nGun violence was also fresh for some in the Washington crowd: Ayanne Johnson of Great Mills High in Maryland held a sign declaring, \u2018\u2018I March for Jaelynn,\u2019\u2019 honoring Jaelynn Willey, who died Thursday two days after being shot by a classmate at the school. The classmate also died. \nRallying outside the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord, 17-year-old Leeza Richter said: \u2018\u2018Our government will do more to stop us from walking out than it will to stop a gunman from walking in.\u2019\u2019 \nSince the bloodshed in Florida, students have tapped into a current of gun control sentiment that has been building for years \u2014 yet still faces a powerful foe in the NRA and its supporters. \nOrganizers hope the passions of the crowds and the under-18 roster of speakers will translate into a tipping point starting with the midterm congressional elections this fall. In addition to pushing for tighter gun laws, the students have been working to register young people to vote. \nPolls indicate public opinion in the U.S. may be shifting on the issue. \nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the U.S. should be tightened.

His mother, Yolanda Moore, 43, of Royal Oak described it as a \u201cblessing\u201d to get to see her son take the mound Saturday afternoon on the historic grounds versus Martin Luther King, Jr. High School of Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to see the hard work that we put in,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut to be able to give back to the community and be down here and see everyone fellowship and just be able to do something positive for the face of Detroit, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Read More: Could train depot be Ford's millennials magnet? PAL secured more than $20 million in donor gifts to build the Willie Horton Field of Dreams and the 8,500 square-foot headquarters and banquet hall, according to a PAL news release. The field is 9.5 acres and maintains the dimensions of the former field. Construction began in June 2016, and the former Major League Baseball stadium was razed in 2009. There was some controversy surrounding the development, including concerns about the turf -- which replaced the grass field -- and over whether the new site would leave enough time for youth leagues and the general public. The Free Press previously reported that Richey told residents at least 51% of activities will be devoted to youth, and that PAL will ensure there are daily public hours. But it will offer the field for private use during daytime hours when children are in school. Former United States Senator Carl Levin told the crowd on Saturday that he fought in the senate to protect the field, even though the stadium was lost. \u201cThis land was unique,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThere was only one field like this in the world.\u201d Bob Selwa, who had attended games at the old Tiger Stadium from 1951 until 1999, said it wasn\u2019t until Saturday morning that he had a chance to step out on the field and walk the bases, one by one.

But make no mistake. Residents of Cleveland enjoy a benefit beyond the NBA Cavaliers' recent championship that doesn't exist in Detroit: Cheap auto insurance. A Free Press examination found that auto insurance premiums in Cleveland are often thousands of dollars a year lower than the highest-in-the-nation rates that Detroiters pay. For example: A former Cleveland City Councilman who drives a BMW and has had multiple drunken-driving convictions pays less than $100 a month. A new resident pays about $65 per month for a Honda Accord, just slightly more than he did in the suburbs. A Cleveland couple in their 30s pays about $100 each month for two vehicles. In Detroit, a sub-$100 monthly auto insurance premium is the stuff of fantasy \u2014 even for those with perfect driving records and excellent credit. One state lawmaker with a good driving record, for example, pays more than $400 a month. Cleveland's low rates persist even as insurers in Ohio use the same non-driving factors when setting premiums that critics say unfairly penalize people in high-poverty cities like Detroit. Those factors include drivers' home ZIP codes, a version of their credit scores and whether they have four-year college degrees. Some say this insurance industry practice is especially discriminatory to black people \u2014tantamount to \"redlining\" areas where they live \u2014 and a major reason for Detroit's sky-high rates that can exceed $3,000 a year to insure a single vehicle. \"We\u2019re simply charged for being black in Detroit,\" state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, D-Detroit, said during debate in Lansing last fall on a proposed auto insurance overhaul that was voted down. But insurance experts say the huge contrast between Detroit's and Cleveland's auto rates isn't because racial or class discrimination by insurance companies is any worse in southeast Michigan than in northeast Ohio. Instead, it's another example of how Michigan's one-of-a-kind no-fault insurance system, which mandates that all motorists buy coverage for potentially unlimited medical benefits, forces Detroiters to pay so much more than anyone else. Read more: Ohioans pay less, get less than Mich. no-fault A Free Press investigation last year found that in Detroit, these no-fault benefits present a lucrative target for profit-seeking medical clinics, lawyers and accident victim solicitors. These profiteers reel in Detroiters who were in accidents with promises of up-front cash, benefits to friends and relatives to be their attendant-care providers, and hopes of a much larger payout in negligence lawsuits. In Michigan, \"you require everyone to have this generous, well-funded insurance, which costs a lot in part because since it's really generous, people are going to use it a lot,\" said Paul Heaton, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who authored a 2010 report on Michigan's no-fault system. Suburbs vs. city The Free Press found that Cleveland residents, like Detroiters, are indeed charged more for car insurance than drivers in many nearby suburbs. But the price difference there between city and suburban markets is only about $7 to $30 per month, according to interviews with Cleveland-area drivers and insurance agents. By comparison, Detroit drivers can see a 50% drop in their insurance rates if they cross city limits and move to suburbs. The Free Press looked at Cleveland because, although smaller in population than Detroit, it is another major Midwest city in a neighboring state with similar weather and population demographics \u2014 Cleveland is Ohio's largest black-majority city. A reporter found numerous Clevelanders who pay less than $100 per month per vehicle for full liability and collision coverage. Buy Photo \nCatholic priest David Schlegel, 56, moved to Cleveland early this year from a suburb and pays the equivalent of $65 a month for his 2010 Honda Accord. (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) A Catholic priest in his 50s who moved to Cleveland this winter pays the equivalent of $65 a month for his 2010 Honda Accord, only slightly more than what he was charged in a Cleveland suburb about 28 miles away. \"I think it was $50 per year, the change in rates\" moving to Cleveland, said the Rev. David Schlegel, who is 56. \"I thought it would be much more.\" In one of Cleveland's most expensive ZIP codes, full coverage for a 45-year-old man driving a newer vehicle could run about $115 to $120 per month, said Raul Santos, a manager at a Young America Insurance office on Cleveland's west side. For a younger man of 25, the rate could be about $160 per month, he said. Some of the cheapest insurance the Free Press found belonged to a Cleveland millennial who said he pays about $200 every six months for just liability coverage on his 2000 Lincoln Town Car. That comes out to just $33 a month. \"I think it's a fair rate,\" 26-year-old Arthur Kostendt said. A Cleveland couple in their early 30s snagged a particularly good bargain for full coverage; they pay just $79 a month for two vehicles. (Model years 2011 and 2012.) Mike Vakos, the agent who sold that policy, said the couple likely had very good credit histories. The cost difference between good credit and bad credit is roughly 30% for a Cleveland auto premium, he said. Buy Photo \nState Rep.

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) Some Detroiters are charged triple that amount or more, including state Rep. Leslie Love, D-Detroit, who drives a 2009 Saturn Aura that is parked in her garage on the city's west side. She said her annual insurance premium on the car dipped below $4,300 last year, then inexplicably shot back above $5,000 for 2018 \u2014 more than $400 per month. Her annual premium is essentially the car's resale value, according to the Kelley Blue Book website . \"I have a friend in Ohio who just pities me,\" said Love, who is in her 40s. She is one of the few Democrats who voted in favor of last fall's unsuccessful no-fault overhaul bill. Few complaints in Cleveland Residents of urban areas generally pay more for auto insurance than those in less-populated ones because of busier roadways, more frequent crashes and more theft. But it's the large expense of no-fault benefits on top of general urban factors that makes insurance in Detroit so expensive. Insurance companies use ZIP codes to contain the costs of claims to the areas where people who generated the claims live, raising premiums for everyone who garages a car there. \"That's why it's more expensive in Detroit, because the people you're grouped with are more likely to have a claim, and that claim has a likelihood of being far higher than in Cleveland,\" said James Lynch, chief actuary at the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, an industry-funded organization. Car insurance affordability is not the pressing issue in Cleveland that it is in Detroit, where an estimated 60% of residents drive illegally without insurance, largely because of the high cost. The Free Press could not find any Clevelanders who thought that their city was being unfairly punished by higher insurance rates. \"They complain about the potholes more than the car insurance,\" said Clevelander D.J. Johnson, 50, who said he pays about $70 per month to insure his 2015 Toyota Camry. Asked whether they worried about Ohio's lack of a strong safety net for survivors of bad car crashes, several Cleveland drivers said they hadn't given that idea much thought. \"That's a good question,\" said Schlegel, the Catholic priest. \"I never have (been in a bad accident), so thanks be to God.\" Buy Photo \nZack Reed, 55, a former Cleveland City Council member, says he pays under $100 a month to insure his 2008 BMW. \"I pay less than $100 a month and I live in a neighborhood that people would say is somewhat crime-ridden,\u201d he says. (Photo: JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) Zack Reed, 55, who was on Cleveland City Council from 2001 until late last year, said that car insurance never came up as a big issue during his time in office. \"I was on council for 17 years, and in my 17 years I can tell you that I have not heard one complaint that's ever come to me based on car insurance,\" Reed said. Reed's own driving record isn't perfect. He was convicted of his third DUI in 2013. Following that, the cost of insuring his 2008 BMW jumped to $151 a month. Now five years later, his monthly rate is back to double digits. \"I pay less than $100 a month and I live in a neighborhood that people would say is somewhat crime-ridden,\" Reed said. \"My insurance cost is lower than my cable.\" No-fault to blame The Zebra , an insurance comparison website, looked at both cities in its nationwide auto insurance analysis between September and December 2017. The analysis was based on a 30-year-old single male with a good driving history driving a 2013 Honda Accord EX. It found Cleveland with a $1,277 average annual auto premium for comprehensive coverage. In Detroit, the average was $5,414. \"Detroit is more than three times what Cleveland is, which is truly remarkable when you think of the proximity of the cities and the states,\" said Alyssa Connolly, the website's communications director. She noted how insurance rates reflect numerous factors, likely accounting for how Cleveland has a smaller population than Detroit (385,809 versus 627,795 by the latest estimates), as well as less than half as many reported auto thefts and roughly 25% fewer vehicle crashes. Still, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of those other factors are significant enough to make rates three times what they are in Cleveland,\" Connolly said. \"All signs seem to be pointing to the no-fault coverage laws in Michigan.\u201d The Ohio Four A Free Press reporter did learn of Ohioans who pay Detroit-level car insurance rates. Four people, exactly. That is the number of drivers in Ohio's last-chance auto insurance program for those whose driving records are so atrocious, no commercial insurer will take them. Yearly premiums for this Ohio Automobile Insurance Plan run about $4,000, said Dean Fadel, the program's manager. \"We've only got four people in the plan,\" said Fadel, who is also president of the Ohio Insurance Institute, a trade group. \"Our last-resort mechanism may be even cheaper than what your regular mechanism is\" in Detroit. Racism the real problem? During last fall's debate in Lansing on the proposed no-fault overhaul, some lawmakers said they couldn't support the legislation because it still permitted insurance companies to use factors such as ZIP codes and non-driving records in setting rates, a practice they believe is discriminatory. \"They don't want to address the root cause of the problem,\" state Rep. Fred Durhal III, D-Detroit, told Crain's Detroit on why he voted no. State Rep. Rose Mary Robinson, D-Detroit, said she also opposed the bill for that reason, among others. \"I just think it's unfair that it was geared to Detroit without resolving the issues of redlining, and all the negative things that historically have been counted against people in Detroit,\" she said this month. The centerpiece of the bill would have given all Michigan motorists a first-ever choice in the amount of no-fault coverage that they must buy. But critics voiced concern that the new options would lure consumers into making irresponsible choices by selecting only the cheapest coverage \u2014 and later regretting it after a bad accident. Also controversial, the bill would have reduced no-fault insurance reimbursement to medical providers by establishing price controls, known as a fee schedule, similar to what exists in Michigan's workers' compensation program, although a bit more lucrative. Despite support from Detroit's Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan, the bill was ultimately voted down 63-45 in the House of Representatives when most Democrats opposed it. Insurers deny 'redlining' There is a history in metro Detroit and across the country of banks, mortgage lenders and real estate agents in the past denying equal services to blacks and those living in predominantly minority areas. A report last year on auto insurance discrimination and redlining by ProPublica and Consumer Reports found that insurers in four states \u2014 not including Michigan \u2014 have been charging drivers in minority-majority ZIP codes significantly higher rates than similar drivers in white-majority neighborhoods, despite fewer insurance claims in the minority areas. The insurance industry contested the report's findings and methodologies. In Michigan, auto insurers have strongly denied allegations of racism and discrimination concerning Detroit rates. Studies have found that credit scores are actually good predictors for the number and total cost of insurance claims that drivers may file in the future. \"The effectiveness of these factors that get pointed at have been proved over and over and over again,\" Lynch said, the Insurance Information Institute actuary. He noted how many people accept that young drivers will have higher insurance rates, even though age is also a non-driving factor. A past actuarial study found some justification for the high auto rates in Detroit. The study, conducted for the City of Detroit by Bloomington, Ill.-based Pinnacle Actuarial Resources and released in 2015 found Detroiters used the medical benefits portion of no-fault, known as personal injury protection, twice as often and for twice the average claim amount as policyholders in the suburbs \u2014 $60,000 in Detroit versus $32,000 among suburban drivers. \nThe Cleveland skyline from Edgewater Park in Cleveland. (Photo: Mark Duncan, AP) Competition holds down rates? During last fall's debate on the no-fault overhaul, several lawmakers cited the legislation's lack of a long-term requirement for lower premiums as one of the reasons they couldn't support it. The mandated price reduction \u2014 40% off the no-fault benefits portion of some policies \u2014 expired after five years. Insurers also weren't compelled to offer the full reduction if it would cause them to lose money. In Ohio, there is no statutory requirement for auto insurers to keep rates at certain levels. Fadel, the Ohio Insurance Institute head, said that general competition among insurance companies is what helps to keep Ohio rates some of the nation's lowest. \"I can tell you the companies here fiercely vie for consumers' business. They all know that price is a major \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 factor in a consumer's purchasing decision,\" he said. Tort vs. no-fault In Ohio, the auto insurance of the driver who caused a crash pays for victims' medical and vehicle damage bills \u2014 but only up to a point. The payout is often determined by the size of the at-fault driver's liability coverage or the victim's own underinsured motorist protection policy. People who cause a crash generally rely on their own private health insurance for medical bills. Ohioans can also sue at-fault drivers for damages beyond the coverage limits in an auto insurance policy. At-fault motorists in Ohio are on the hook for what their insurance plan doesn't cover. But these lawsuits are not guaranteed windfalls because many defendants lack sizable personal assets and judgments can be discharged in bankruptcy, according to several Ohio accident attorneys. The system is very different in Michigan. Under no-fault, auto insurers pay the lifetime medical bills of insured drivers and the drivers' passengers, regardless of who caused the accident. No-fault also provides lost wages and in-home chores money and attendant care for basic needs. The trade-off for these extensive benefits is Michigan's higher legal hurdles for suing negligent drivers. Those lawsuits succeed only if someone was killed or suffered a serious bodily impairment in the crash. Lower prices, greater risk Nationwide, 38 states have a tort-based system similar to Ohio's and 12 states use no-fault rules. Nevada, Georgia, Connecticut and Colorado completely dropped no-fault in response to rising costs. In Michigan, no-fault benefits claims have been rising fast and now far exceed collision payouts. The average no-fault claim in the state for so-called \"personal injury protection\" was $56,207 last year, more than double the 2007 average of $25,689, according to insurance industry data from the Independent Statistical Service. The average Michigan collision claim rose 40% to $3,811 during the same period. And the bigger the claims, the higher the auto insurance rates for Michigan drivers. A survey by carinsurance.com put the average Michigan premium at $2,484 a year, the most expensive in the country. Ohio drivers aren't mandated to buy medical coverage with their car insurance \u2014 a money-saver on their premiums. Ohio has some of the lowest auto insurance rates in the nation, averaging $952 a year according to the carinsurance.com survey. Yet without no-fault-type coverage, Ohioans are at greater risk of financial ruin should they be seriously hurt in an accident and forced to take time off work. For the catastrophically injured, the final stop in Ohio can be a Medicaid-funded nursing home. \"Medicaid, what they provide \u2014 you're like a beggar. It's just substandard care,\" said Ronald Smolarski, owner of Beacon Rehabilitation Services in Ann Arbor who forecasts the future medical costs of severely injured people in several states. At least one Michigan lawmaker believes that Ohio's lower insurance rates are worth the risk. Jason Sheppard, R-Temperance, who lives about 1 mile from the state border, recently introduced a package of bills that calls for replacing Michigan's no-fault system with an Ohio-style system to lower statewide rates. Sheppard said that out of curiosity, he once got an Ohio insurance quote for his family's two vehicles. The Ohio rate was less than half the $4,000-plus annual premium that he currently pays for both. He said it's common to see Michigan residents who live near Ohio with Ohio license plates \u2014 and presumably cheaper Ohio insurance \u2014 after having registered their vehicles across the border at family members' addresses. Such a gambit is considered insurance fraud. So far, Sheppard hasn't heard any anecdotes involving the reverse: Ohioans trying to get Michigan no-fault insurance. \"The question becomes, 'is it that bad in Ohio?' \" he said.

The field will be dedicated to Tigers great Willie Horton. (Photo: Detroit PAL) CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Baseball fans looking to relive some nostalgic memories can make their way to the site of the old Tiger Stadium this weekend for the grand opening of a new ballpark. The facility, named the Corner Ballpark presented by Adient, will serve as the new Corktown headquarters and stadium for the Detroit Police Athletic League, according to a news release from the group. The site will be open to the public at 9 a.m. Saturday and a ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. Guests will be able to tour the new facility and watch baseball games between metro Detroit high school teams, the news release states. \u201cThis is a very exciting time for Detroit PAL and the city of Detroit,\u201d said Tim Richey, CEO of Detroit PAL, in the statement. \u201cWith the help of our generous donors, we have been able to build a new home for PAL and our 14,000 girls and boys. This new stadium is a statement to PAL\u2019s commitment to the sports and programs we offer and the youth of Detroit.\u201d Read More: Dearborn mayor backs Ford's Detroit expansion The development hasn't been without its controversies, including concerns whether the new site would leave enough time for youth leagues and the general public and that the grass field would be replaced with turf. The Free Press previously reported that Richey told residents at least 51% of activities will be devoted to youths and that PAL will ensure there are daily public hours but will offer the field for private use during daytime hours when children are in school. PAL secured more than $20 million in donor gifts to build the 8,500-square-foot headquarters and banquet hall and the Willie Horton Field of Dreams presented by Meijer, according to a news release on PAL's website. Construction began in June 2016, and the old ballpark was razed in 2009. The Detroit Tigers last played there in 1999. \nTiger Stadium in 1999. (Photo: MARY SCHROEDER, DETROIT FREE PRESS) The ribbon-cutting ceremony on the field will feature speeches from Richey, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, Detroit Police Chief James Craig and former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, according to a release. Events, including a private dinner, a donor wall unveiling, and a Paul W. Smith Live Remote, were planned for Friday. The sold-out dinner was to be the first event held in the new stadium and the first time the public will see the facilities, PAL stated in a news release. Tickets are still available for $75 for the MVP Afterglow from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday. The MVP Afterglow includes access to the facility and field, PAL said in a statement.

This year\u2019s event is held under the theme (Connect2Earth) under the auspices of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. Celebrating the event is part of RTA \u2019s keenness to play an active role in achieving sustainable development in Dubai, and raise the profile of the Emirate in environmental sustainability and energy saving. Nasir Abu Shehab, CEO of Strategy & Corporate Governance Sector cum Chair of Energy & Green Economy Committee at the RTA , said: \u201cThe RTA has charted out a plan for this year\u2019s Earth Hour events, which will be held today from 08:30 pm to 09:30 pm . Events include switching off 1433 streetlights in the Business Street, Al Saadah Street, Boulevard Street (Burj Khalifa), Al Mamzar Beach Street (from Boats Slipway to Al Mamzar Park), the parking lot of Shandagha Heritage Village, and Al Khaleej Street (from Elderly Home at Mamzar to Al Mamzar Park). Activities will also include local roads opposite to the sea at Jumeirah; which will save about 683.7 kilowatts.\n\u201cAs part of the Marina Promenade celebrations at the Business Bay, the RTA will run several activities including children games and contests, hydrogen-powered taxi, and a model of the bus-washing water treatment plant. Two buses will be deployed to lift participants from the Business Bay MS to the site of the event,\u201d he added. Advertisement \u201cLights and some air-conditioners will also be turned off at RTA Head Office, Main Customers Happiness Center at Umm Al Ramool, Public Transport building in addition to Al Rawiyya & Al Khawaneej stations, and Jebel Ali Bus Depot. Lights will also be switched off on the 5 th floor of the Parking Terminal of Rashidiya MS, premises of the Dubai Taxi Corporation and employees accommodation. Several Metro Stations will switch to the maintenance mode, and some conveyor belts at metro stations will cease operation. The overall saving resulting from the switching off streetlights and facilities of the RTA is expected to be in the order of 10,000 kilowatts in one hour only.\n\u201cThe active participation in Earth Hour events illustrates the special attention accorded by the RTA to environmental sustainability and energy saving. Such efforts are reflected in the achievement made by the RTA as the first government entity in the region to obtain ISO Energy Management Certification (ISO 50001) in 2013. The RTA has also introduced the Green Economy Award in 2014 and developed a comprehensive structure for the Green Economy in 2016. It has also motivated employees and companies in a bid to source innovative ideas in support of this drive,\u201d concluded Abu Shehab. \n-Ends-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "majdi abu zaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasir abu shehab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "environment & energy sustainability press release  roads & transport authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strategy & corporate governance sector cum chair of energy & green economy committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the roads & transport authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai electricity and water authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai supreme council of energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "marina promenade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T13:39:11.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f97c504af247b6f6ae7133679e302cc852c17b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7wwwhvuiNFgu7O4AVVZk_SznnWVqx6qKujH.DEBHL6HL_orMEiq_0C_XAkhOKEdN2", "site_full": "gulftoday.ae", "site": "gulftoday.ae", "site_section": "http://gulftoday.ae/pages/rss.ashx?id=28", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Local", "title": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "title_full": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "published": "2018-03-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f97c504af247b6f6ae7133679e302cc852c17b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7wwwhvuiNFgu7O4AVVZk_SznnWVqx6qKujH.DEBHL6HL_orMEiq_0C_XAkhOKEdN2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up", "text": "Dhs20 million auto body unit to be set up By our business bureau Send to Friend \nDUBAI: Industrial refrigeration specialist company Al Furat has announced the setting up of a unit to build a wide range of vehicle bodies.

The first-leg between the two Dubai clubs had ended in a scoreless stalemate.The Clarets had won the first leg 4-2 at Al Nahyan Stadium, but found that their two-goal advantage had vanished within five minutes.Dibba got off to a flyer when Diogo da Silva\u2019s shot was parried by goalkeeper Rashed Ali but Rodolfo da Silva finished the rebound from close range into the empty net, giving the hosts the lead less than 60 seconds into the game.Dibba added a second blow to Al Wahda as Rodolfo da Silva doubled their lead in the fourth minute, heading home Ahmed Rashed\u2019s right footed cross.The visitors got back into the game in the 18th minute as Sebastian Tagliabue took advantage of Dibba\u2019s defenders poor clearance and controlled the ball inside the box before applying a spectacular back-heel finish into the net.Mourad Batna equalised the score 12 minutes before the break when the goalkeeper blocked Tagliabue\u2019s shot into his path and the Moroccan finished the ball into the empty goal.The hosts took the lead again when captain Driss Feltouhi dribbled on the right flank before sending a golden pass to Sanad Ali to tap in Dibba\u2019s third goal three minutes into the second half. Dibba suffered a blow at the hour mark as they had to complete the match with ten players after dismissal of Yasser Salem who received his second yellow card.Tagliabue equalised for Al Wahda in the 90th minute after a solo effort before completing his hat-trick in the dying seconds, sweeping home Mohammed Al Shehhi\u2019s cross to ensure Al Wahda win the reverse fixture 4-3 and advance to the final.In the second semi-final second-leg match played at the Zabeel Stadium in Dubai, Al Ahli took an early lead when Abdalla Saleh scored in the 14th minute of the game.However, almost immediately, Shabab Al Ahli restored parity after a Mohammed Ismail pass saw Ismail Al Hammadi help his club draw level with a goal in the 16th minute of play.The first half ended with the teams locked at 1-1.In the 72nd minute, Shabab went ahead with a goal from Anber Esmail. They looked to have one leg in the final when Al Wasl\u2019s Abdulrahman Ali was given the marching orders after a second yellow card.However, two goals in the dying minutes of the game, one in the 87th minute Humaid Abdulla Abbas, and the second coming in injury time \u2014 from star striker Caio \u2014 ensured 9-man Al Wasl\u2019s passage into the final.

Doing so serves the Municipality\u2019s objectives to address current and future waste-related challenges and maintains sustainability.Dawood Abdul Rahman Abdullah Al Hajiri, Director-General of Dubai Municipality, said, \"The project represents a significant step forward that will cement Dubai\u2019s leading global position. The Dubai Municipality plays a key role in the project, as it is commits to organising and managing services in order to ensure they meet the highest standards. We must face the challenges and strive to meet the project\u2019s strategic goals, which seek to make Dubai the first and only city in the world to use artificial intelligence in transporting and processing waste to generate clean and sustainable energy.\"\"The Dubai Municipality has set an action plan to implement the project immediately after the launch; the plan was titled \u2018The Vision of the Future City, Today\u2019,\" Al Hajiri revealed. \"To that end, we formed a task force consisting of young, passionate and driven Emiratis to carry out this initiative, and firmly establish the global leadership of the Dubai Municipality. We are working to create an ecosystem that embraces change and disruption, and a smart, flexible environment that engages both the public and private sectors, as well as the general public, to implement the services of the future.\"The initiative consists of developing a world-first, decentralised waste-treatment platform for buildings and residential districts in Dubai. The system uses technology developed by Dubai Municipality to treat all types of solid waste after sorting them using artificial intelligence, AI, and smart technologies. The decentralised units raise the temperature of the waste resulting in the breakdown of its chemical components, producing clean electrical energy that will be exported to the local electricity grid.The initiative is a continuation of the Dubai Municipality\u2019s project to convert solid waste into energy; the project includes building the world\u2019s largest energy terminal in terms of production capacity and thermal conversion efficiency. This, in turn, contributes to the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Master Plan, which seeks to steer 100 percent of the city\u2019s waste away from landfills by the year 2030.The project includes carefully analysing the statistics pertaining to waste and the high costs of collection and treatment, in addition to the environmental disadvantages of harmful emissions from Dubai\u2019s landfills. It increases the Municipality\u2019s efficiency by reducing operational costs, eliminates the environmental footprint of buried waste, and prevents loss of land to landfills.As it stands, the Emirate of Dubai produces 3.5 million tonnes of waste annually, uses 7,560 square metres of land as landfills, deploys 3,850 garbage collection vehicles to all its districts, all at a daily operating cost of Dhs2.3 million.Once implemented, the Wastenizer system will produce 17,500 tonnes of good ash for the production of green concrete. The Municipality is working in partnership with local and international companies specializing in artificial intelligence, infrastructure, and waste-to-energy, transportation, in addition to major real estate and property developers, in order to execute the ambitious project. Implementation began with research and development in the fourth quarter of 2017, before moving on to forging strategic agreements with potential partners from the private sector in Q1 2018. The pilot phase of the project has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2018, with the system entering full implementation in several regions of the emirate just before the opening of Expo 2020.Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Chairman of Dubai Executive Council and Chairman of DFF\u2019s Board of Trustees, launched the bold plan, among several avant-garde proposals for Dubai 10X at the 6th World Government Summit, held in Dubai in February 2018. The Dubai 10X initiative seeks to place Dubai Government entities ten years ahead of the rest of the world in all sectors, propelling the emirate into the future by implementing today what other cities around the world will be implementing ten years from now.Sheikh Hamdan approved 26 projects presented by 24 government entities. The shortlisted projects were evaluated by a panel of experts out of a total of more than 160 ideas submitted by 36 parties in less than 365 days.WAM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abdul rahman abdullah al hajiri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dubai future foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai municipality", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T17:42:58.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1a44eaf13681b2587ea63c0e8c1208a2b835dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ7JHmj3BdM22ExilywwIQ.v8rkPd_LD7XQLzNAC9dpHBHoBriuXFxiMgE_Y.okLtL3A5tV.xGASzVsomEizfWM_HtWtx_5clQiBW6Uz6614EW4KNXdCWSVwfqLRkYItD6GwBfEkyc9JYkeCZHf5Qezzklj54jTtBKWSUwNqJPAoQmfOdKvgkyBMROuNGeKrNoyw0BnKn6h4dco9UzZdg7j", "site_full": "www.zawya.com", "site": "zawya.com", "site_section": "http://www.zawya.com/rss/pr.cfm?section=2", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Zawya.com - Press Releases - Companies News", "title": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "title_full": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "published": "2018-03-24T08:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.zawya.com/pr/images/2018/dc_2018_03_24.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1a44eaf13681b2587ea63c0e8c1208a2b835dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ7JHmj3BdM22ExilywwIQ.v8rkPd_LD7XQLzNAC9dpHBHoBriuXFxiMgE_Y.okLtL3A5tV.xGASzVsomEizfWM_HtWtx_5clQiBW6Uz6614EW4KNXdCWSVwfqLRkYItD6GwBfEkyc9JYkeCZHf5Qezzklj54jTtBKWSUwNqJPAoQmfOdKvgkyBMROuNGeKrNoyw0BnKn6h4dco9UzZdg7j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T08:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai", "text": "Dubai Culture Engages the Public to Strengthen its Innovative 'Dubai ArtBank' Initiative during Art Dubai Press Release \nDubai, United Arab Emirates: Dubai Culture & Arts Authority (Dubai Culture), the Emirate\u2019s dedicated entity for culture, arts and heritage, is engaging the public to involve them in strengthening its innovative \u2018Dubai ArtBank\u2019 initiative during the 12 th edition of Art Dubai, which runs from 21 st to 24 th March 2018. \nThe \u2018Dubai ArtBank\u2019 will introduce an innovative new model for managing art collections and transacting in creativity and art as bankable assets through a new Dubai Art crypto-currency.

The 50-year-old from Ghana has three children to support, one of whom has special needs.\nHisham Al Zahrani, manager of Zakat and Social Services at Dar Al Ber said: \u201cSince he has lost his job, his middle child who suffers from learning difficulties and bowlegs has not been receiving treatment and all his children have stopped going to school.\u201d\nMr Davidson has three children, a girl aged 16 and two boys aged 14 and 3.\n\u201cI was raised with my two brothers and three sisters to show respect to the elderly and to work hard to reach whatever we set as our aspirations\u201d he said.\nRead More:\nUAE Helping Hands: Kidney patient fears she will be sixth member of her family to die....\nUAE helping hands: Veteran UAE expat left homeless and in debt after job loss\nHe moved to Dubai on March 10, 1997.\n\u201cIn Dubai, I did all I have been taught both at home and at school.

It is a motorcycle that has been very much on its own journey, growing in physical size and displacement over the decades, all the while creating an enduring and unrivalled reputation for luxury, quality and comfort. It has amassed a huge fan base here in the UAE and numbers grow each year, with the riders wanting to be part of the Gold Wing heritage. The 2018 GL1800 Gold Wing takes a new direction and is brand new from the wheels-up. It still has an evocative, flat six-cylinder engine that delivers an avalanche of torque and power, and it still remains Honda\u2019s flagship premium tourer, loaded with features that allow two people to ride in style. Yet it\u2019s smaller, much lighter and much more agile \u2013 very much a true \u2018rider\u2019s motorcycle\u2019.\nSharing a common engine and chassis platform, the new \u2018Wing will be available as the base model GL1800 Gold Wing, and as a \u2018Tour\u2019 edition with top box, which will also offer a version equipped with DCT and air bag. Depending on the variant, up to 48kg has been saved compared to the previous model. Advertisement Optimised for size, the new flat six-cylinder engine has lost none of its power, torque and addictive delivery. Throttle By Wire has been added, with 4 rider modes; TOUR, SPORT, ECON and RAIN. Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) maintains rear wheel traction while the suspension damping and Combined Brake System (CBS) alter depending on mode selected. Hill Start Assist (HSA) and Idling Stop add ease of use and improve fuel efficiency.\nThe manual transmission is now 6-speed, while the new Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) features 7-speeds, with clutch feel, shift speed and rpm range of up/downshifts tailored specifically to each riding mode. It also features a creep forward and back function. The manual machine employs the same reverse system as the previous design. \nThe performance improvement is matched by even greater levels of relaxation: the stylish, aerodynamically-efficient fairing channels air around the rider and the electric screen adjusts for preference; the seats provide all-day comfort. New features like the smart key system, Apple CarPlay and Bluetooth connectivity bring even more convenience. \nSTYLING & EQUIPMENT \nThe new Gold Wing is a completely different proposition and replaces the relaxed lines of the outgoing model with a more honed, athletic ethos. \nAlso on display is the motorcycle itself \u2013 the double wishbone front suspension, flat six-cylinder engine, exhausts \u2013 in all their functional beauty. Drawn together the design elements create cutting edge style, underpinned by incredible levels of engineering and electronics. \nScreen angle and height adjustment is step-less. Available as options are a larger screen, a fully-adjustable deflector for the arms and upper body and fixed deflectors for the lower legs and feet. \nAll lighting is LED. The lower portion of the headlights use five polished optical lenses on both sides to create a Jewel-Eye low beam light signature. Using high beam (in the upper portion) creates a stereoscopic impression. The front indicators are housed in the mirrors and the indicators also auto-cancel; the system compares front and rear wheel speed difference and calculates when to cancel the indication relative to the riding situation. \nThe rear top box of the \u2018Tour\u2019 versions will hold two full-face helmets; combined with the panniers 110L storage capacity is available. \nCapacity of the fuel tank is 4 litres less at 21 litres. But as the new Gold Wing is so much lighter and more aerodynamic, improved fuel economy of 5.6 litres/100km means tank range is similar to the previous design. \nLuxurious instrumentation creates a unique cockpit. Different low-contrast colours with dark tones are applied to the dials, of which the peripheral areas form cone-shaped slopes to create a feeling of depth. A ring with a metal texture surrounds each dial, and the graduations glow in LED, giving concrete depth and a calm, cool image. \nThe 7-inch full-color TFT liquid crystal display screen provides infotainment-related information (for the audio systems) as well as managing the HSTC and suspension adjustment. Information is displayed in differentiated segments in a very functional order, so the rider can get all the relevant data with the minimum of eye movement. \nOperation of the luggage is simplified. With the smart key present a push button opens the panniers and top box. It is also possible to temporarily unlock the luggage via remote control; the unlock button on the smart key enables the passenger to instantly access the saddlebags and the rear luggage box. Hydraulic dampers smooth the opening and closing. Pushing and holding the call button results in the indicators flashing. \nThe Gold Wing is now compatible with Apple CarPlay, so the rider can utilise the personalised information and content inside their iPhone, such as telephone numbers and music playlists. Bluetooth connectivity has been adopted and a USB cable can also be plugged in. \nCHASSIS \nThe new Gold Wing\u2019s die-cast aluminium twin beam frame is designed to package the engine in a tighter space, 40mm further forward. Its structural thickness has been optimised in each area to deliver a smooth and stable ride, from walking speed upwards, whether on tight city streets or out on the open road. The frame and swingarm together are 2kg lighter than the previous design. \nRear spring preload is also now electrically adjusted. It\u2019s an intuitive \u2013 rather than numerical \u2013 system. Separate from the four riding modes, there are four settings of preload relative to load from soft to hard: single rider; rider with luggage; rider with pillion, and rider with pillion fully loaded with luggage. The setting is displayed on the TFT screen and adjusted via switch. \nENGINE \nCore to the previous Gold Wing\u2019s appeal was its turbine-smooth flat six-cylinder engine, which produced torque from low rpm with a distinctive power delivery and feel that quickly became addictive. \nTo realise the handling ambitions of the new chassis the 1,833cc engine too has been redrawn. Still as a horizontally-opposed flat six, but now with four valves per cylinder rather than two, much more compact in size and 6.2kg lighter. \nPeak power of 93kW arrives @ 5,500rpm, with peak torque of 170Nm delivered @ 4,500rpm. The bore size of 73mm (from 74mm) has been optimised to stroke of 73mm and bore pitch shortened 9mm; the left and right cylinders are offset 4mm and the cylinder sleeves are now aluminium. Compression ratio is set at 10.5:1. \nTOUR mode is the base setting for comfort and power. It gives a direct 100% opening ratio between throttle grip and throttle body butterfly, with \u2018default\u2019 damping and front/rear brake force distribution. \nSPORT serves up the highest throttle to butterfly ratio and delivers strong acceleration, with firmer damping and rear brake lever pressure. \nECON mode offers maximum fuel economy and easy cruising, with lower throttle to butterfly ratio and default damping and brake force. \nRAIN turns the dial down to suit wet and slippery conditions, with lowest throttle to butterfly ratio, default braking force distribution and soft suspension damping. \nIn all four riding modes HSTC constantly allows controllable acceleration in slippery conditions. \nTo complement the engine\u2019s deep bass signature the exhausts now emit a powerful throb, without excessive noise. The cross-sectional areas of the exhaust pipes have been reduced 20% for two out of the six cylinders, bringing about the change in sound volume and depth. \nThe ISG (Integrated Starter Generator) combines the generator and starter motor into one component, with the generator effectively becoming the starter motor when supplied with reverse power. \nKey characteristics of the Idling Stop system are the ultra-quiet start-up of the engine thanks to the use of ISG, and the smooth starting feeling achieved through a combination of DCT and TBW control. When stopping at a traffic light with the Idling Stop system on, the engine automatically stops after three seconds and, when restarting, the rider only needs to turn the throttle, which immediately starts the engine. \nHill starts on a conventional motorcycle often involve simultaneously releasing the brakes, opening the throttle and engaging the clutch according to the grade of the slope. To ease this effort, the new manual transmission Gold Wing has adopted Hill Start Assist (HSA). \nThe new 6-speed manual gearbox lowers the engine speed when cruising at 100km/h, compared to the previous 5-speed design. It\u2019s also fitted with a \u2018cam damper\u2019 between the clutch and transmission, separating each inertial mass, reducing noise and improving shift quality/durability. \nDUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION \nHonda\u2019s unique Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) is a natural fit for the new Gold Wing engine and development revolved around DCT as the base. This is the third all-new generation of the system and the first to have 7-speeds, specifically designed for long-distance cruising; it\u2019s also extremely smooth and fast shifting. And lighter than the 5-speed manual transmission fitted to the previous design. \nThe new Gold Wing\u2019s DCT features a 1.8km/h forward Walking Mode with reverse of 1.2km/h, operated instantly from a +/- switch on the left handlebar. \nThe all-new Goldwing is available at Al-Futtaim Honda showrooms across the UAE and retails from AED 109,900. \nFor more information, call 800 HONDA (46632) or visit http://www.honda.ae. \nAbout Al-Futtaim Honda \nAl-Futtaim Honda, part of Al-Futtaim Automotive, is the sole distributor for Honda vehicles, motorcycles, marine engines, power products and parts.

Infrastructure respondents also expect to partner with tech firms with over half of the infrastructure respondents, an increase of circa 50 per cent, anticipating a joint venture in the next three years. Nick Ogden, infrastructure expert and Partner at Pinsent Masons, commented: \"For investors, having technology providers play a leadership role means there are real incentives motivating them to provide the best technology and speed up delivery. Our survey shows that 92 per cent of infrastructure investors will often or always consider technology when making investment decisions over the next three years. This shows that investors are willing to spend the money which will drive this growing trend. Collaboration is already here, and is only going to increase. On projects where infrastructure and technology are truly integrated, you can imagine there is the potential not just to create more efficient assets but also create new markets that haven't existed before.\"\nThere are, however, obstacles with this convergence. Both infrastructure and technology respondents cited overcoming cultural differences as the main challenge to Infratech projects once initiated and 37 per cent of respondents thought that the siloed approach to both sectors was a major barrier. Advertisement \"Infrastructure needs to learn from tech firms and start changing from the inside-out by bringing technology into all aspects of their operation. Both sectors will need to bring together their commercial objectives, whilst understanding each other's varied risk appetites, commercial drivers and business models,\" Ogden added.\nAgreeing data requirements and standards was identified in the research as the second biggest challenge for projects where technology and infrastructure are integrated, with regulatory constraints ranking in third place. A clear majority of respondents, 91 per cent, prefer an open access model with ownership of any data captured by Infratech. However, the same respondents report that data captured by Infratech is available to all in just 62 per cent of the projects they work on. \nBill Smith, Dubai-based Infrastructure Partner at Pinsent Masons, commented: \"Clear leadership is needed from governments to ensure that data and information security regulations are fit for purpose in order for the benefits of Infratech to be fully maximised. Despite the rapid pace of technological change and digital disruption, the UAE is a prime example of how beneficial Infratech can be when clear guidelines are put into place.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe clear vision of both His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and the Dubai Government is to firmly cement Dubai's place as a world-leading smart city. Under their stewardship, we have seen Dubai take a leading role in embracing Infratech for the benefit of its residents: for example, by the establishment of Smart Dubai Government (SDG) whose express mission is to 'deliver world-class smart services and infrastructure to create happiness '. This statement encapsulates the very essence of Infratech, and what it is intended to deliver into the future.\" \nInterestingly, the report shows that monetising data from infrastructure comes fairly low on the list of ways Infratech is seen as adding value, mentioned by only 21% of all respondents. However, Pinsent Masons' view is that data will have significant potential as a revenue generator and its value must not be overlooked. \n\"Data monetisation will become a more significant feature for those involved in Infratech, particularly once the opportunities and risks are better understood by the Infratech ecosystem, and robust data sharing arrangements and data standards are in place to support emerging business models,\" added Simon Colvin, Technology Partner at Pinsent Masons. \"Across our global markets, we are seeing interesting PPP models emerge that incorporate data monetisation as part of the financial base case, so the success of the project will depend on revenue streams from data generated by project assets. This underlines the views of the investors, that there are new revenue streams and value to be driven out from this digital and data transformation,\" he concluded. \n'The Evolution of Infratech' report is produced in association with the Institution of Civil Engineers, techUK and Mergermarket. In total, 300 people were surveyed, including direct equity investors in the infrastructure sector and senior-level executives from the infrastructure and technology/ communications provider sectors. Respondent companies were all global leaders in their fields and include those listed on FTSE 100, Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Korea Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and NYSE, among others. \nThe companies involved were split between the UK, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. The survey included a combination of qualitative and quantitative questions, and all interviews were conducted over the telephone by appointment. Results were analysed and collated by Acuris andPinsent Masons, and all responses are anonymised and presented in aggregate. \nAdditional in-depth interviews were conducted with experts and executives from a selection of infrastructure and technology firms, as well as universities and public-sector bodies. The findings were also discussed at a roundtable event with senior representatives from a range of stakeholders. The results of all the interviews and the roundtable helped inform the core messages of the report. \nAbout Pinsent Masons \n\nPinsent Masons is a global 100 law firm, specialising particularly in the energy, infrastructure,   advanced manufacturing and technology sectors.

Image: RollingNews.ie \nA 36-YEAR-OLD man told gardai he was \u201cabsolutely not guilty\u201d when he was charged today with the murder of Vincent Ryan during a shooting in Dublin in 2016. \nJeffrey Morrow from Burnell Court, Malahide Road, Dublin 17, was arrested this afternoon at Dublin Airport after he was extradited from the UK. He was taken to a garda station where he was charged with the murder of Vincent Ryan at McKee Road, Finglas, Dublin on 29 February 2016. \nRyan, a 25-year-old father, was gunned down while sitting in his car. \nMr Morrow is the second person to be charged over the fatal shooting. \nOn 12 March, Paul O\u2019Beirne, 35, with an address at Colepark Drive, Ballyfermot, Dublin, was also charged with his murder and was remanded in custody. \nDressed in a grey tracksuit and black runners, Mr Morrow was brought to appear before Judge Michael Walsh at Dublin District Court this afternoon. \nDet Sergeant Alan Brady told the court he arrested the 36-year-old at the airport at 12.18pm on foot of an arrest warrant. When he was charged at Finglas Garda station Mr Morrow replied, \u201cabsolutely not guilty\u201d, said Det Sergeant Brady. \nJudge Walsh said due to the nature of the charge there was no application for bail. He remanded Mr Morrow, who did not address the court, in custody. \nHe will face his next hearing on 27 March at Cloverhill District Court. \nBail in murder cases can only be granted in the High Court. \nDefence solicitor Stephanie O\u2019Meara made an application for legal aid and told the court her client was \u201cnot working and not in receipt of income having come in on foot of a European Arrest Warrant\u201d. \nNoting there was no Garda objection, Judge Walsh granted legal aid. \nAt co-accused Mr O\u2019Beirne\u2019s hearing on 12 March, evidence of arrest, charge and caution was given by Det Sergeant Gavin Ross of Finglas station who told the court that accused was arrested earlier that day at his home address at 2.36pm on foot of a warrant issued by the district court. \nDet Sergeant Ross had said Mr O\u2019Beirne was taken to Ballyfermot Garda station where he was charged. \nThe court heard he was handed a copy of the charge and in reply after caution said: \u201cNothing got to do with me at all.\u201d \nDet Sergeant Ross confirmed the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that Mr O\u2019Beirne was to face trial on indictment in the Central Criminal Court.

Had he been fit, I think we may have made it, who knows. \nHe would have given us a much better opportunity. \nI've said to him, and I'd rather say it when hes not in the room, he's an absolutely world class player. Advertisement \nWorld class or not, it is curious what O'Neill's overt praise of Coleman means for his able replacement Cyrus Christie. \nRecently awarded Ireland's Young Player of the Year during a weekend ceremony, although it was certainly not O'Neill's intention, his Coleman comments will inevitably lead to questions regarding Christie's future involvement in the squad. \nAt 29-years-old, O'Neill's comments would suggest that Coleman - injuries notwithstanding - will be in possession of that right full-back position for the foreseeable future. Having made such a tremendous recovery, seamlessly slipping back into Everton's side, his fitness and physical preparation will stand him in good stead. \nFour years his junior and having recently joined promotion-hunting Fulham, Christie will unquestionably be keen to hold onto his place in the side. Given O'Neill's comments however, he may have to settle for a prolonged spell on the sidelines.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cyrus christie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arthur james o'dea", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seamus coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin o'neill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aviva stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donegal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:22:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b84acd7f6817ccde397b8da9056aab6e1738b910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mF5HXnAwAm88Fk1nFYD6_id8WbUQtrqrDB5706YSba2K4tu2yQdnj", "site_full": "www.hotpress.com", "site": "hotpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.hotpress.com/rss/rss.php", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "hotpress.com - Latest", "title": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "title_full": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hotpress.com//store/images/adm/21/21860/21860612_PC_TM.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b84acd7f6817ccde397b8da9056aab6e1738b910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mF5HXnAwAm88Fk1nFYD6_id8WbUQtrqrDB5706YSba2K4tu2yQdnj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Listen: Picture This release new track 'This Morning'", "text": "Read More The Gloaming will release Live At NCH album ahead of concerts this March \nThe Gloaming will play seven sold-out shows at Dublin\u2019s National Concert Hall, from March 5-12, their only live appearances of 2018.

I didn\u2019t realise these types of school drills were largely unique to America until I moved abroad. \n\u201cI want to help build an America where these kinds of drills don\u2019t need to happen anymore.\u201d \nJohnson said he would like the marches around the world to remind Americans that \u201croutine mass shootings just don\u2019t happen outside of the US\u201d. He is calling on elected officials to work across the aisle to protect people from gun violence. \nOslo \n(Sandi Salus/PA) \nActivist and scientist Sandi Salus, 45, helped to bring the Oslo rally together. This wasn\u2019t her first foray into the world of protest \u2013 she has helped to organise Women\u2019s March Norway 2017 and 2018 and the March for Science Norway 2017. \n\u201cI ended up meeting a few other American expats here during the first Women\u2019s March and one of them had started up an organisation called PAAL (Progressive American\u2019s Action League) here in Oslo with the intent of fighting against social, racial, and environmental injustice happening back home in the US but also locally in Oslo,\u201d Salus explained. \n\u201cI got burnt out a bit after this last Women\u2019s March but the Parkland shooting just really hit hard. I had already had a hard time looking to the US from Norway and seeing all of this gun violence occurring year after year with nothing being done about it.\u201d \n(Sandi Salus/PA) \nWhen the Parkland students announced the March 24 event, Salus felt ready to throw herself into organising again, to show the students they had international support, and show lawmakers in the US that expats were watching. \n\u201cI also think that it is important that we share our perspective \u2013 that we have had the chance to live outside the US and see how another place deals with gun reform.\u201d \nAt Saturday\u2019s rally, attendees lit candles and Salus gave a speech \u2013 then the floor was opened to others who had points to make. \n\u201cOne young woman, an American, told of how her life has been touched by gun violence, including knowing gun victims as well as teaching young students in San Antonio, Texas and having to keep them calm and ease the students\u2019 fears as they had to undergo gun-violence drills,\u201d said Salus. \u201cIt was very moving.\u201d \nAlso in attendance was a survivor of the Ut\u00f8ya attack in 2011, when a gunman killed 69 young people attending a summer camp. According to Salus, \u201che has now committed his life to gun safety as well as helping with the mental health issues of those who have gone through a horrible incident of gun violence\u201d. \nMumbai #MarchForOurLives Tanushka (@_tanushka13) March 24, 2018 \n\u2019s protest will be held on Sunday March 25 and 17-year-old student and writer Mahek Chacha is planning to attend. \n\u201cAs an Indian, it is thankfully a far-fetched thought for an adolescent to purchase a gun and terrorise the lives of countless people, whatever the reason may be,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWatching such events unfold as an outsider, as someone who is not American, the cause and prevention of mass shootings is painfully obvious to me. \n\u201cRaising the age for gun licences, thorough background checks for potential gun owners, better security in public places, especially schools, are just some of the ways to easily prevent gun violence, yet at the hands of gun owners and the NRA itself, no such action has been taken.\u201d \nChacha says that as a student herself, she finds the idea of students fearing gun violence at school to be \u201cincredibly painful\u201d. Although she cannot relate to that feeling, she is joining the protest to support American teens in their quest for gun reform. \nBarcelona \n(Rebecca Gonzalez/PA) \n\u201cI am inspired by young leaders like Florida students who instead of staying home being afraid, overcame the fear and stood up for their rights,\u201d said Rebecca Gonzalez, 21, a political science student who attended a rainy rally in Barcelona\u2019s Placa Catalunya. \n\u201cI truly admire them so I want to stand up with them as a young student in solidarity.\u201d \nDespite the rain, more that 75 people attended the rally, during which speeches were given and 17 pairs of shoes laid out in a circle to represent those who were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. \n(Rebecca Gonzalez/PA) \nJessica Craig, 44, who organised the small gathering, said: \u201cThis was the first time I organised a demonstration around such an intense and painful issue. \n\u201cSome of the stories other women shared were so much more emotional than I was expecting. \n\u201cIt makes you realise the insanely large number of people who are impacted by gun violence when even a small demonstration so far away from the US ends up including people who have had a direct experience of a mass shooting or people who live each day worrying about this.\u201d \nMelbourne The rain didn\u2019t stop us! persephone nihil (@IDidThisMyself) March 24, 2018 \nYoung activist Persephone Nihil took it upon herself to organise Melbourne\u2019s March For Our Lives with a friend, inspired by the actions of Florida\u2019s Parkland students. \n\u201cNot only has America been standing by and ignoring their gun problem, so has the rest of the world,\u201d the 16-year-old said. \nNihil would like the outcome of the global marches to be \u201ca reflection on the consistent weakening of gun laws internationally, and the lack of gun laws in America, and finally seeing some change in gun laws and the deadly culture surrounding them\u201d. \nLondon \n(Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nIn the UK, concerned activists headed to Edinburgh and London to stand with students in the US. \nStephen James Rushbrook, 47, travelled from the Isle of Wight especially to add his voice to the hundreds of children and adults outside the US Embassy in Nine Elms. \nThe computer game artist said he took part in the rally \u201cbecause I believe the way the USA proudly treats its guns and the current, distorted reading of the second amendment as a fetish is sick and perverse\u201d. \n(Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nRushbrook said he has done his own research on shootings in the US and felt he had to support the building opposition against the NRA, gun lobby and the gun manufacturing industry. \n\u201cI am sensitive that a certain percentage of the USA will tell us to mind our own bloody business, but it is important that the industrialised world shows solidarity with the US\u2026 We\u2019ve all gone through this and made the choice that individual liberty to own guns is outweighed but the need to protect the most vulnerable in out community, our children.\u201d \nTokyo Reminder, if you are in Tokyo and wish to support the #NeverAgain movement, there will be a @AMarch4OurLives event tonight at the Hachiko statue in Shibuya at 5PM. \u2014 Kat Callahan (\u9b8e\u5ddd\u304d\u304a) (@JezebelKat) March 24, 2018 \nKat Callahan, 34, who was at high school when the Columbine shooting occurred and now lives in Japan, said the US is no different from other nations that have implemented gun control, there is just a lack of political will to do so. \nThe writer and teacher joined American expats and Japanese citizens in Hachiko Square in Tokyo. Attendees held signs bearing the names of victims of various school shootings in the US. \nCallahan feels teenagers are not taken seriously by adults when raising important issues about their welfare. Today, I joined the #MarchForOurLives in Tokyo pic.twitter.com/Z3P0vapkgg \u2014 \u265bRica (@luthorscanary) March 24, 2018 \nShe said: \u201cWhile many are finally listening to the students of Parkland, they are not unique. This is not to suggest they are any less amazing than they are, but it is to highlight the number of teens over the last 20 years that have tried to raise awareness only to be shut down, ignored, shouted over, and sidelined. \n\u201cRelatively recently black teens and other teens of colour have led their own protests to gun violence, including police violence, which has to be part of the conversation, and have not been given the same attention as the Parkland students, despite being just as active, passionate, and hard-working. \n\u201cI\u2019m really glad people are listening to the Parkland students, and teens more generally, but I gotta ask, where the hell have you been for the last 20 years?\u201d \nCallahan has been touched personally by gun violence. \n\u201cWhen I was in high school, my school bully and I got into a fight. He went home, grabbed his abusive father\u2019s gun, and while there was a raging debate inside his own head (from what we can glean from the note), he decided not to become a school shooter,\u201d she said. \n\u201cInstead he shot himself in the head. \n\u201cI consider him a victim of the same easy access to guns as any others. He should never have been able to so easily get his hands on a weapon, and he should not have been without the resources to get the help he needed.\u201d \nFor Callahan, international protests and support send a signal to elected officials. \nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019re watching. We\u2019re organised. We vote\u2026 Americans abroad are organised and part of this movement. We won\u2019t be left out.

That's not a sound economic investment.\"\nCalgary police say they handed trespassing notices to five people for the occupation, but no charges or fines were issued. \nThe occupation of the office was not the only Trans Mountain event on Friday.\nRallies organized by Lead Now, which is opposed to the pipeline, were set to take place outside 44 Liberal MP offices across the country. \n\nHere\u2019s another look of this heated demonstration of people for and against pipelines outside @kenthehr \u2019s #yyc offices. pic.twitter.com/LqidIqVUuQ \n\u2014 @ReidSouthwick At Kent Hehr's office in Calgary, more than 100 people gathered from different sides of the debate. Those in support of the project vastly outnumbered those opposed. \nThe supporters were part of an effort organized by the pro-oil group Canada Action, which said rallies would take place in Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg.\nSteve Phillips said he was there to show support for Alberta oil. \n\"Heard about it, come down here to show my support for the pipelines. Sick and tired of Alberta oil being sold for half price. It's clean oil. It's ethical oil.

He said he started to return to the pool when the same security guard told him he needed his ID to do so. \nFrustrated, he said he tried to run past a security guard to go get his ID but said he only got a few steps before the guard tackled and handcuffed him, his face hitting the ground in the process.

The Alberta government's plan rests on the company's controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\nJason Kenney, leader of the Official Opposition United Conservative Party, slammed the NDP government for putting Alberta on track to $96 billion in debt. \n\"If there was any indication the NDP was going to change its course and become fiscally responsible that was blown out in a spectacular way in today's NDP budget,\" he said. \nKenney said the revenue projections aren't plausible either. \n\"This is one part recklessness, one part completely unrealistic projections, higher taxes, massive increases in debt, all of which will burden future generations of Albertans,\" he said. \n\n\n$1B into general revenues \nThere currently is a $30 per tonne tax on carbon, which Albertans pay on home heating bills and gasoline, for example. All the revenue is now spent on rebates and emission-reduction programs.\n\nWhen the tax, which the federal government ordered provinces to impose, reaches $40 a tonne in 2021, Alberta intends to still use $30 for projects intended to reduce carbon footprints, the remainder will go to general spending purposes.\n\nThat will translate into an additional $1 billion per year being pumped into general revenues by 2023-24.\n$1B  upgrader  plan aimed at getting Alberta off boom-bust  rollercoaster \nThe government continues to emphasize that adoption of the federal carbon plan is tied to go-ahead of construction of the Trans Mountain expansion.\nThe budget has very few goodies for the average Albertan, and most major spending projects have already been announced.\nThey include a tax credit to encourage gaming and digital media companies to locate in Alberta, and a grant and loan program to encourage companies to build two to five partial bitumen upgraders.\n\u200b Alberta offers tax break to digital gaming, media companies There are no changes in personal and corporate income tax rates, nor are there increases for liquor and tobacco.\nThe government is expanding two social programs promised in the 2015 provincial election, which were rolled out on a limited basis over the last two years. The school lunch program will expand from 5,000 to 30,000 students, while a $25-a-day childcare program will be hiked by 4,500 spaces.\nThere's also money to build 20 new schools and hire 600 new teachers. And the province is also allocating $11 million to organizations that help survivors of sexual assault.  \u200b\nAlberta government bill proposes $43M to create 3,000 tech training spaces over 5 years Child intervention services will get an additional $800 million.\nThe government intends to hold spending below population growth plus inflation, Ceci said. There are no major cuts in services.\nThe government is slowing down infrastructure spending and is expecting zero salary increases from its major public service unions. The Alberta Teachers' Association, United Nurses of Alberta and the Health Sciences Association of Alberta have already agreed to zero increases.\nNegotiations with the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees are still underway.\nThe deficit forecast for the 2018-19 fiscal year is $8.8 billion, with $47.9 billion in revenue and $56.2 billion in expenses.\nThe debt is forecast at $54.2 billion by the end of the fiscal year, a figure that is 15.4 per cent of the province's gross domestic product.

According to Mayor Jorritsma, the new coalition should not be too ambitious. \u201cMore ambitions on a weak foundation; that is not going to work.\u201d \nThe mayor emphasised that the new term of the council must have a professional board, which will address the problems firmly. These include the financial shortages but also the malfunctioning organisation of the city. \u201cI will do everything within my powers, also regarding the new coalition parties, to steer them clearly towards these aspects.\u201d \nMayor Jorritsma says he is satisfied by the outcome of the election. Beforehand he was worried about the possible splintering of the Eindhoven city council because sixteen parties took part in the election. \u201cThe council will be made up of twelve parties; fortunately not 16. A city has to remain governable. Parties will, after all, have to make compromises. Now there is a framework of bigger parties who can form a coalition.\u201d \nHe did, however, let it be known that he thinks forming a coalition will not be easy, especially between the two biggest parties, the VVD, who are conservative liberal, and GroenLinks, who social-democratic. \u201cThese two have polar opposite opinions about, for example, climate, Vestdijk, and Eindhoven Airport. These will be the important issues in the coalition talks.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jorritsma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john jorritsma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eindhoven", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eindhoven", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T19:06:17.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3316a92b1fcfd3f3643aa84ac93100769acf361f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlrfDnGbe3cGLzX3fcBmj2kpkt94l5sdzplIUzjm7dk_K6BktYNyTZAcBJNMkVA34-", "site_full": "e52.nl", "site": "e52.nl", "site_section": "https://e52.nl/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "E52", "title": "Breakfast with\u2026 Bjorn van de Langenberg", "title_full": "Breakfast with\u2026 Bjorn van de Langenberg", "published": "2018-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://e52.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-23-at-5.29.49-PM.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3316a92b1fcfd3f3643aa84ac93100769acf361f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlrfDnGbe3cGLzX3fcBmj2kpkt94l5sdzplIUzjm7dk_K6BktYNyTZAcBJNMkVA34-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Renske Mehra", "published": "2018-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breakfast with\u2026 Bjorn van de Langenberg", "text": "Geen\u2193 Deel \nHet is een ijskoude donderdagochtend in Eindhoven als Bjorn van de Langenberg binnenloopt in het afgesproken cafe. De gevoelstemperatuur buiten is dertien graden onder nul. Uit het oosten waait een straffe wind. Bjorn is vandaag \u2018toch maar niet\u2019 uit Boxtel komen fietsen. Hij kijkt erbij alsof het een lastige keuze was. Bjorn fiets namelijk graag. Heel graag. \nTijdens een ontbijtje blikken we alvast vooruit op het nieuwste wielerfestival van Eindhoven. \nBjorn van de Langenberg sportondernemer \nOntbijt broodje carpaccio met cappuccino \nOrganiseert het High Tech Crit Festival \nHij groeit op als oudste in een gezin van vijf kinderen. Voorbestemd om de boomkwekerij van zijn ouders over te nemen. Maar ondanks een opleiding aan de HAS in Den Bosch besluit Bjorn van de Langenberg zijn eigen weg te gaan. \nHij wordt sportondernemer. Met zijn bedrijf organiseert hij clinics met topsporters en ontwikkelt hij vitaliteitsprogramma\u2019s voor bedrijven. Deze zomer komt alles samen in een spiksplinternieuw wielerfestival op de High Tech Campus. \nEen festival dus, met muziek en goed eten. Maar vooral ook een plek waar fietsen en innovatie samenkomen. Als amateur kun je technologische hoogstandjes testen die normaal alleen voor profs zijn weggelegd. Tegelijkertijd wil Bjorn dat het High Tech Crit Festival laagdrempelig is. Dus ook voor kinderen, opa\u2019s, oma\u2019s en mensen met alleen een \u2018gewone\u2019 fiets. \nDeelnemers kunnen toertochten \u2013 75, 110 en 150 km \u2013 maken en high tech e-bikes proberen. Heel bijzonder: bedrijventeams die meedoen aan de ploegenrit kunnen een gratis test doen in de nieuwe windtunnel op de TU/e. \nDat is in juni. Eerst is Bjorn nog gericht op de \u2018pre-party\u2019 op 21 april. Dan vindt een kleiner sportevent plaats op de Campus, de MTB Challenge . Mountainbikers leggen een parcours van 10 km dwars over de Campus af. \u201cDus hoogtemeters maken in de parkeergarages en racen over de vlonders van de grote vijver.\u201d \nHet ontbijtje wordt ondertussen geserveerd. We zitten bij de Velosoof op het NRE-terrein. Op de achtergrond hangen de fietsen van Bert Oosterbosch . De succesvolle wielrenner uit Eindhoven die helaas al op 32-jarige leeftijd overleed. \nBjorn vertelt hoe de puzzelstukjes langzaam op z\u2019n plaats lijken te vallen. Sinds de start van zijn bedrijf heeft hij ingezet op een goed netwerk. Hoe je dat opbouwt? In het geval van Bjorn: wielercaf\u00e9s organiseren. \u201cEen gezellige avond in een caf\u00e9setting waar wielerfans komen luisteren naar verhalen uit de koers.\u201d \nHij kent aanvankelijk alleen ex-wielrenner Karsten Kroon, die weer twee ploeggenoten meeneemt naar het eerste caf\u00e9. En zo gaat het balletje rollen. Nog geen jaar later schuift Tom du Moulin al aan om terug te blikken op zijn seizoen. Voor het High Tech Crit Festival heeft hij wielrenners Puck Moonen en Bram Tankink als ambassadeurs aan boord. \nDe caf\u00e9s leveren hem naast een netwerk onder de professionals ook contacten op met andere ondernemers. Hij voert verschillende gesprekken over een wielerfestival. Er blijkt veel enthousiasme voor zijn plan en sponsors als Shimano haken aan. \n\u201cIedereen hunkert weer naar een mooi wielerevent in Eindhoven\u201d, zegt Bjorn enthousiast. In juni is het zover. \n\nBeeld: Corine Spaans \nIt is a cold Thursday morning in Eindhoven when Bjorn van de Langenberg walks into the cafe. The temperature outside feels like thirteen degrees below zero. A strong wind is blowing from the east. Bjorn \u201cwas in doubt this morning\u201d but decided not to come by bike from Boxtel (a 30 km ride). He looks as if it was a difficult choice. Bjorn likes to ride his bike. Very much so. \nWe meet for breakfast to talk about the newest cycling festival in Eindhoven. \nBjorn van de L angenberg sports entrepreneur \nBreakfast carpaccio sandwich with cappuccino \nOrganizes the High Tech Crit Festival \nHe grew up being the oldest in a family of five children. Destined to take over the tree nursery from his parents. But despite an education at the HAS in Den Bosch, Bjorn van de Langenberg decides to pursue his own path. \nHe becomes a sports entrepreneur and starts organizing clinics with top athletes and developing vitality programs for companies. This summer, everything comes together in a brand new cycling festival on the High Tech Campus. \nA festival, so expect nice music and good food. But most of all, this will be the place where cycling and innovation come together. As a bike lover, you can test high tech tools that are normally reserved only for professionals. At the same time, Bjorn wants the High Tech Crit Festival to be accessible for everyone. So also for children, grandparents and people with just a \u2018normal\u2019 bike. \nParticipants can sign up for tours \u2013 75, 110 and 150 km \u2013 and try high tech e-bikes. A very cool detail: business teams taking part in the team ride can do a free test in the new wind tunnel at the TU/e. \nThat is June. First, Bjorn is still focused on the \u2018pre-party\u2019 on 21 April. A smaller sport event taking place on the same Campus, called the MTB Challenge . For mountain bikers that want to try something different (making altimeters in the parking garage, for example). \nMeanwhile breakfast is being served. We are at the Velosoof , where Bert Oosterbosch\u2019s bicycles are hanging from the ceiling. The successful cyclist from Eindhoven who unfortunately died at the age of 32. \nBjorn tells how everything seems to be falling into place. Since the start of his company he has been building a network. How? By organizing \u2018wielercaf\u00e9s\u2019 (cycling meetups). \u201cA cozy evening in a pub-like atmosphere where cycling fans come to listen to stories from the professional cyclists.\u201d \nAt first he only knows former cyclist Karsten Kroon, who brings two team mates to the first pub evening. But then things go fast. Not even a year later, Tom du Moulin is attending the wielercaf\u00e9 and sharing his stories with the audience. \nBesides a network among the professionals, the Wielercaf\u00e9s also bring him in contact with other entrepreneurs. Many meetings about a possible cycling festival follow. There is a lot of enthusiasm for his plan and sponsors like Shimano decide to join. \n\u201cEveryone is craving for a new cycling event in Eindhoven\u201d, says Bjorn enthusiastically. In June, it will finally happen. \nHe becomes a sports entrepreneur and starts organizing clinics with top athletes and developing vitality programs for companies.

Es gab mehr Versp\u00e4tungen Der Bahn-Vorstand pr\u00e4sentierte die Zahlen am Donnerstag in Frankfurt am Main Foto: dpa/Soeren Stache \nDer Vorstandschef der Deutsche Bahn AG, Richard Lutz, legte am Donnerstag eine Bilanz mit Rekordumsatz und h\u00f6herem Gewinn vor. Allein in seinen Fernz\u00fcgen, ICE und IC, z\u00e4hlte der bundeseigene Konzern gut 142 Millionen Fahrten, das sind 2,3 Prozent mehr als 2016. Insgesamt nutzten die Kunden die Bahn im Fern- und Regionalverkehr 2,08 Milliarden Mal. Bei Qualit\u00e4t und P\u00fcnktlichkeit m\u00fcsse das Unternehmen jedoch nachlegen. Die Bahn erzielte im Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2017 einen Rekordumsatz von 42,7 Milliarden Euro (plus 5,2 Prozent). Unterm Strich stand ein Gewinn von 765 Millionen Euro nach 716 Millionen im Jahr zuvor (plus 7 Prozent). \nProfite wurden vor allem durch den Fernverkehr und das Auslandsgesch\u00e4ft erzielt. Die internationalen T\u00f6chter DB Arriva und DB Schenker machten \u00bbmittlerweile fast die H\u00e4lfte unseres Umsatzes aus\u00ab, sagte Lutz. \nDie Probleme mit der P\u00fcnktlichkeit nannte Lutz \u00e4rgerlich. Im Fernverkehr waren lediglich 78,5 Prozent der Z\u00fcge p\u00fcnktlich, das waren sogar 0,4 Prozentpunkte weniger als 2016. F\u00fcr dieses Jahr strebt die Bahn eine Quote von 82 Prozent an. \nKritik kam von der Gewerkschaft deutscher Lokomotivf\u00fchrer. \u00bbDas h\u00f6rt sich alles gl\u00e4nzend an. Kratzt man jedoch an der Oberfl\u00e4che, kommen tiefe L\u00f6cher zum Vorschein\u00ab, so der Bundesvorsitzende Claus Weselsky am Donnerstag in Frankfurt am Main. Zwar werde nach dem jahrzehntelangen Abbau von Infrastruktur und Personal mit viel Geld versucht, die Schiene auszubauen. \u00bbDie Systemfehler werden aber nicht angegangen. Statt viel Geld in Leuchtturmprojekte wie Stuttgart 21 zu versenken, muss das Netz f\u00fcr den Schieneng\u00fcter- und -personenverkehr konsequent nach einem integralen Taktfahrplan ausgebaut werden\u00ab, so Weselsky. Es sei \u00bbwitzlos, mit 300 Stundenkilometern \u00fcber die Gleise zu sausen und dann eine Stunde auf den Anschlusszug zu warten.\u00ab Schon jetzt fehlten allein 1.000 Lokomotivf\u00fchrer bei der DB und deren Durchschnittsalter liege bei rund 50 Jahren, so dass in n\u00e4chster Zeit viele in den Ruhestand gehen werden. Dass der Konzern 2017 \u00fcberhaupt die P\u00fcnktlichkeit (Versp\u00e4tung unter sechs Minuten) von beinahe 79 Prozent erreicht habe, \u00bblag ma\u00dfgeblich daran, dass Lokomotivf\u00fchrer und Zugbegleiter den Verkehr flexibel und mit \u00dcberstunden aufrechterhalten haben\u00ab, so Weselsky.

Dessen neue Fluggesellschaft Laudamotion werde acht Jets samt Besatzungen an die Lufthansa-Tochter Eurowings vermieten, wie eine Lauda-Sprecherin am Freitag best\u00e4tigte.

Eine Zusammenarbeit \u00fcber den genannten Zeitraum hinaus wollen beide Seiten in den kommenden Wochen pr\u00fcfen. Die Lauda-Maschinen sollen laut \u201efvw\u201c von D\u00fcsseldorf, Wien und Palma starten. \nRyanair will Mehrheit an Laudamotion \u00fcbernehmen Laudamotion ist die Nachfolgegesellschaft der insolventen Air-Berlin-Tochter Niki, die der Lufthansa-Konzern auf Druck der EU-Wettbewerbsh\u00fcter nicht \u00fcbernehmen durfte. Lauda hatte die Airline zun\u00e4chst alleine erworben, sich dann aber \u00fcberraschend mit dem Lufthansa-Rivalen Ryanair verb\u00fcndet. Die Iren wollen perspektivisch 75 Prozent an der Laudamotion \u00fcbernehmen, die \u00fcber attraktive Start- und Landerechte an deutschen Flugh\u00e4fen verf\u00fcgt.

The review of Lebanon, which had started on 15 March, could not be completed as scheduled due to a strike called for by the United Nations staff at the United Nations Office at Geneva on 16 March. The review resumed on 22 March with the participation of Lebanon by a video conference from Beirut, and in the presence of the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva. Presenting the report, Salim Baddoura, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, informed the Committee of the adoption of a new electoral law which recognized the right to vote of the Lebanese diaspora; the next election would be held on May 16 and would see many new candidates running including more than a hundred women. In the face of a massive influx of Syrian refugees - an estimated 1.5 million joined the already large Palestinian diaspora - Lebanon refused to heed the calls to resort to a state of emergency and intended to remain a model in the region. An independent National Human Rights Commission had been established in accordance with the Paris Principles, and a standing commission against torture would be set up as well. A bill to protect whistle-blowers was being drafted, and Lebanon was also developing a personal status bill which would recognize the right not to declare religion and the right to embrace another religion, and would repeal some outdated provisions, such as the prohibition for a Lebanese woman to transmit the nationality to her children. The marriage under the age of 18 would soon be prohibited, said the head of the delegation, urging the Committee to consider the situation of the country in assessing whether the efforts in this regard were sufficient. Noting that it had been twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, Committee Experts started the interactive dialogue by praising the country for hosting more than one million Syrian refugees and assuming a burden which strained its infrastructure. They commended positive legal reforms including criminalization of torture and the new electoral law, and said that challenges related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and the country\u2019s cultural and religious pluralism continued to persist. While recognizing realities of domestic political instability and the regional geopolitical situation, Experts were nevertheless concerned by lack of action to overcome the confessional political system and asked about efforts to combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance. They urged Lebanon to address the reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including children; improve conditions of detention, alleviate overcrowding, and investigate abuses happening within prison walls. While Lebanon had made efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end had not yet been adopted, Experts remarked. They raised concern about the still unknown fate of the more than 17,000 people who had been disappeared between 1975-1990, and the comprehensive impunity in this area - there had been no prosecution relating to enforced disappearance to date. Discrimination against women continued as personal status laws created barriers to their equality in matters of marriage, divorce, custody and alimony, and Lebanon still lacked a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would include a definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination, and a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the Covenant. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Baddoura thanked the Committee for a courteous discussion which would hopefully represent a milestone in the cooperation between Lebanon and the Committee. Margo Waterwal, Committee Rapporteur, in her concluding statement, thanked the delegation of Lebanon in Geneva and in Beirut for their flexibility. The delegation of Lebanon consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of State to the Women Affairs, Ministry of State to the Human Rights Affairs, Ministry of State for the Displaced Affairs, the National Commission for Lebanese Women, and the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Committee will issue its concluding observations and recommendations on the report of Lebanon towards the end of its session, which concludes on 6 April 2018. All the documents relating to the Committee\u2019s work, including reports submitted by States parties, can be found on the session\u2019s webpage . The webcast of the Committee\u2019s public meetings is available at UN Web TV . The Committee will next meet in public at 10 a.m. on Monday, 26 March to discuss the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on the follow-up to the concluding observations, and the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on follow-up to views. Report The Committee is considering the third periodic report of Lebanon ( CCPR/C/LBN/3 ). Presentation of Report SALIM BADDOURA, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, started by reassuring the Committee of the commitment of his country to its international obligations. The electoral law recognized the right to vote of the Lebanese diaspora and the next election was to be held on May 16, in which many new candidates were standing, including more than a hundred women. The new Government had established a Ministry of Human Rights and a Ministry for Women. Mr. Baddoura stressed that in the face of a massive influx of Syrian refugees, in which an estimated 1.5 million had joined the already large Palestinian diaspora, Lebanon refused to heed the calls to resort to a state of emergency and intended to remain a model in the region. An independent National Human Rights Commission had been established in accordance with the Paris Principles, and Lebanon intended to set up a standing commission against torture. Lebanon had ratified the Convention against Torture and had submitted its first report to the treaty body responsible for its implementation. A bill to protect whistle-blowers was being drafted, said the Ambassador, and informed the Committee that sanctions had been imposed on law enforcement officers who had used disproportionate violence during demonstrations. The right not to declare religion or to embrace another religion was envisaged in the framework of a personal status bill, which at the moment was not unified. The bill would repeal some outdated provisions, such as a prohibition for a Lebanese woman to transmit her nationality. Lebanese women occupied a growing place in the world of work, including in senior positions in the public and private sectors, emphasized Mr. Baddoura. There was a system in place to enable women victims of violence to seek reparations. The law prohibited modern slavery and trafficking in human beings; a strategy was in place to improve the border control in this context, while bilateral agreements had been concluded with countries of origin of migrant workers. The marriage under the age of 18 would soon be prohibited, said the head of the delegation, urging the Committee to consider the situation of the country in assessing whether the efforts in this regard were sufficient. The Lebanese State was serious about developing its capabilities and was committed to respecting its international obligations, reiterated the Ambassador and went on to reassure the Committee that the civil society, whose activity was vital, could act and express itself freely. The authorities worked in cooperation with the civil society on the basis of shared values, he said and concluded by expressing hope that the dialogue with the Committee Experts would be constructive. Questions by Committee Experts A Committee Expert remarked at the beginning of the interactive dialogue that it had been twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, and then praised Lebanon for its approach to Syrian refugees, noting that, since the outbreak of the crisis in Syria, Lebanon had hosted more than one million refugees and asylum seekers, assuming a burden which strained its infrastructure. The Expert commended the State party for initiating positive legal reforms such as the adoption of legislation establishing a national human rights institution and a national preventive mechanism for torture; the criminalization of torture and the adoption of a new Electoral law. Challenges still remained, however, related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and the country\u2019s cultural and religious pluralism. The Expert had concerns about the status of the Covenant in the domestic legal order and its relation with the Lebanese Constitution. He asked the delegation to cite examples of case law where the Covenant had been invoked before national courts, and to explain steps taken to raise awareness about the Covenant in the judicial and legislative milieu. To ensure that the National Human Rights Institution became operative, the Expert inquired whether members had been appointed, what its budget was and under what mandate it operated. Lebanon planned to overcome its confessional political system however no action had been taken due to the domestic political instability and the geopolitical situation in the region. The Expert recalled that during the visit to the country in 2015, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief had taken note of the cautious approach to preserve the interreligious balance in various social spheres to ensure stability, and wondered whether such an approach could also lead to discrimination in various social spheres. What educational measures would be taken to combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance? Discussing the discrimination of women, civil society submissions flagged the continuing discrimination against women in the various personal status laws, for example in erecting greater barriers for women who wished to terminate their marriage, initiate divorce proceedings, ensure their rights concerning their children after divorce or secure pecuniary rights from former spouses. Had measures been taken to ensure equal treatment of women in the personal status laws? What were the plans concerning the adoption of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would include a definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination, and a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the Covenant, as well as an open-ended list of prohibited grounds related to social status and gender identity and orientation? What remedies were available to victims of discrimination? Lebanon should amend the Constitution to include a minimum list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, Experts urged. The Committee was concerned about the reports of a rise in arrests under article 534, which were based on physical characteristics or dress, and in fact targeted the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community. Although Lebanon had stated that prison sentences for members of those communities were more lenient, and even if they were only given a fine, it remained on their records for three to five years. Persons were harassed and attacked on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and for the most part were not protected by the police. Seminars to mark the day against homophobia in Beirut, were met with threats by the Association of Muslim Scholars, which posted threats on Facebook; rather than protecting the individuals, the authorities cancelled the events. What were the measures taken to protect persons subjected to discrimination and violence, including hate speech, on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity? Would Lebanon consider adopting hate crime legislation and abolishing article 534 completely? Another issue of concern was the persistence of discriminatory legal provisions and practices which prevented women from fully enjoying their rights, especially in the personal status law, nationality law and penal code. Women were poorly represented in political life and legislative bodies although there were no explicit obstacles to their participation in these institutions. With regards to violence against women, what was the status of the amendment to law 239 which the Ministry of Justice had proposed to strengthen the protection of survivors of domestic violence, and did it include also marital rape? The Experts also raised issues concerning sexual harassment in the workplace, corporal punishment of children and the age for contracting marriage, and asked about shelters for victims of violence. There were reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and also reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including children. Was arbitrary detention a common practice and what legal safeguards were in place for all persons deprived of liberty? While Lebanon had made efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end had not yet been adopted. No executions had been carried out since 2004, however the national human rights action plan to adopt the moratorium on the death penalty had not been implemented. Experts stressed that the right to demand a pardon on the particular circumstances of the case could not replace the judicial authority of whether or not to impose the death penalty. The Committee was pleased to see the institution of a Prison Refurbishment program, yet there was still a trend of prison overcrowding, with certain centres having a more than 185 per cent occupancy rate. Between 2012 and 2016, 81 people lost their lives in detention centres of \u201cnatural\u201d causes; hygiene conditions remained poor and there were reports of abuse by prison guards. Lebanon must improve conditions of detention, take steps to alleviate overcrowding, investigate abuses happening within their walls, and ensure that refugees and immigrant populations were held separately. There were more than 17,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Lebanon between 1975-1990, and reports of secret places of detention; yet, there had been no prosecution relating to forced disappearance to date. Impunity in this area was comprehensive, Experts said, reminding Lebanon that the right of families to know what happened to their members was enshrined in international human rights laws. A number of mass graves had been identified but only one had been exhumed with the identification of bodies. Did Lebanon have plans to exhume the others and identify the bodies and thus give closure to families? The criminalization of abortion was connected with religious beliefs and therapeutic abortion was only practiced if the life of the mother was in danger. The criminalization pushed some 40,000 women every year towards unsafe abortions at a great risk to their health, and significantly increasing maternal mortality rates. The law protected a person\u2019s right not to be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and Lebanon had broadened the scope of legal protection by ratifying the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in line with the provisions of article 7 or the Covenant. On October 26, 2017 the Chamber of Deputies had approved a draft act that criminalized the offence of torture, including a definition of the offence of torture, Experts said and remarked that it fell short of Lebanon\u2019s obligations under international law. Lebanese law also contained a set of rules aimed at ensuring that prisoners were treated with humanity. Preventive and punitive measures had been adopted and conditions for detainees held in Lebanese prisons were improving. Yet there were still concerns. Statistics showed that 60 per cent of persons arrested in Lebanon for over a year were subjected to torture and serious ill treatments, 52 per cent of female detainees were also victims of torture. Detained refugees were forced to sign a statement confirming their voluntary repatriation to their country of origin after being tortured. Children and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons were also subject to torture. What was the State party doing to address torture in prisons? What rights did the prisoners have? Responses by the Delegation In response to Experts\u2019 questions related to the constitutional and legal framework, a delegate said that the Constitution attached special importance to the Covenant, as reflected in its preamble. A number of judicial rulings had invoked the Covenant on political and civil rights, for example in the area of asylum law. Judges and prosecutors received continuing professional education, which included human rights training, said the delegate noting that the bar association in Beirut held at least one session per year on the principles and provisions of the Covenant. In addition, four or five years ago, Lebanese universities had adopted a decision on including human rights in the curricula in all sectors and faculties of academic training and universities. Non-discrimination and gender equality was the subject of a number of questions and comments, said a delegate, reiterating that the Lebanese civil law drew no distinctions between men and women. Women could take up positions on an equal footing with men, in the diplomatic corps, judiciary and public service, said a delegate. Religious law did not seek to oppress women; it provided everyone with their rights while civil law covered areas not covered by personal status laws which were based on a person\u2019s religious denomination. Referring to the 2014 Domestic Violence Act, certain amendments were being debated in Parliament with a law on early marriage and the movement of minors. With regard to civil marriage, there was a strong trend toward adopting a law concerning this but it was hampered because of the political situation. The law did not recognize marriage of Lebanese citizens abroad. The National Strategy for Women had been adopted in 2012 to ensure their equal treatment in all walks of life. Looking at the law, the media, social activism and training, efforts had been made in those domains regarding the progress of women\u2019s rights. There was a strategic aim to ensure equal rights and obligations for men and women. The Media Act raised the media\u2019s awareness to women\u2019s condition in Lebanon. Educational opportunities were equal between girls and boys but there were also efforts to integrate more women in the education system. With regard to health, continued the delegate, men and women equally accessed reproductive health rights and health care. The Government was currently amending laws that discriminated against women\u2019s economic and commercial rights. Many campaigns had been launched that insisted in including women in electoral lists. There were efforts now for Lebanese women to pass their nationality to their children. Procedures were being adopted to give residency rights to spouses of Lebanese people as well. Civil society organizations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons were invited to participate in activities organized by the National Human Rights Institution, said the delegation, emphasizing that everyone had the right to bring a legal case regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Specialized tribunals had handed down four judgments under article 504 of the penal law. Laws guaranteed sexual freedoms but there was no security campaign in place to protect those individuals in the private domain. As for violence against women, amendments to the law protecting women and families in a public space, had been submitted for approval in Parliament. Those amendments would indeed allow for the criminalization of marital rape. The law held that violence against women with a view to having sexual relations constituted aggravating circumstances. It was also compatible with international laws and instruments. There was a bill before Parliament, which sought to criminalize sexual harassment in the workplace and in the public sphere. A number of measures had been taken to address violence against women, said the delegation. Internal security forces had created a specialized centre for victims of domestic violence to receive complaints and ensure their temporary shelter while those complaints were investigated. A special prosecutor for intra-family violence was in place, and in cooperation with civil society, the police were trained in dealing with domestic violence and the victims. Victims of violence could always call on the support of a provisional, secret shelter. A new electoral law had been adopted in 2017 which required representation of all societal categories with particular emphasis on female candidates. There was an accelerated approach to establish human rights training in military spheres in Lebanon. Torture and other conflicts with international humanitarian law cases were reviewed in cooperation with other governmental bodies. Speaking on the death penalty, the delegation emphasized that the laws governing it were in line with the Covenant, as the capital punishment was only used for the most serious crimes. It was important to understand that the use of the death penalty required a decree on the part of the executive, stressed the delegate, noting that the death penalty had not been used since 2004. Judges were allowed to transmute the death penalty to life in prison on the condition that the victim\u2019s family was informed and received reparations. The dialogue with the delegation of Lebanon continued on 22 March via a video conference from Beirut; representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva were present in the room. Responses by Delegates With regard to questions of confessionalism, with roots dating back to Ottoman times, the delegation said that Lebanese society was multi-denominational, with 18 different religious communities recognized by the State. Each of these communities has its own personal status rules that applied only to its members. This confessional diversity was also reflected in the political system and the distribution of certain public functions. Faith diversity was considered one of the guarantors of coexistence as it ensured the protection of the specificity of each community and ensured its active participation in governance and public administration. It might seem legitimate to think that taking into account the confessional diversity in governance and administration had the effect of limiting the application of the principle of equal rights for all Lebanese, noted the delegate, since confessional membership could constitute a discriminatory element among the Lebanese. Moreover, the State committed, within the framework of the preamble of the Constitution, to the abolition of political confessionalism, but it had done almost nothing in this sense, because of the political and security instability. Already under the Ottoman Empire, confessionalism had ensured all Lebanese communities the enjoyment of a certain number of rights. With independence, a mixed \u2013 hybrid \u2013 system of governance had been put in place, in which confessionalism and democracy were mixed. Community identity did not stand in the way of national identity, stressed the delegate; when a soldier fell in the fight against terrorism or a hostile foreign state, when a judge made a verdict, they did not do so by virtue of the values \u200b\u200bof their confession. The constitutional amendments under the Ta\u2019if Agreement represented a stability of power, upholding the social fabric of Lebanon and the responsibility of all. Since 2008, every citizen could demand that the mention of his or her denominational membership be omitted from the registers of civil status, or be deleted. According to the inventory of the Directorate General of Personal Status of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, about 300 people had used this provision in 2016. The criminalization of torture had been effective at all levels according to international law. Lebanese law recognized torture in all circumstances and stipulated various levels of punishment which was proportional to the torture inflicted, and it also granted courts the rights to offer rehabilitation to torture victims. About 60 complaints of torture had been lodged in 2017, which resulted in sanctions for some 40 officers. The Committee Against Torture had been created under the Paris Principles and was tasked with investigating, reporting, and educating about human rights. The Committee visited detention centres in a random fashion and spoke with detainees concerning their conditions. They also gathered information from Lebanese administrative authorities and received recommendations on improving those detention centres. There also had to be a sufficient budget to cover the mandate, which would be part of the budget finance package of 2018. Referring to fundamental guarantees for detainees, community police had been adopted as part of the \u201ctogether towards a safer society\u201d, programme, whose goals were based on four objectives: safety, bolstering partnerships with society, accountability and human rights, and raising the level of professional expertise. Members of this body were trained and conducted programs and visited prisons, thus developing criteria to assure the conduct of those visits. Article 1 of the Convention against Torture was also adopted and integrated into Lebanese legislation, further protecting prisoners\u2019 rights, and a complaint mechanism was in place with cameras installed to monitor detention centres. The conditions of detention centres, said a delegate, in light of the surge of refugees, were overcrowded. To cope with that increase, new prisons were constructed in the north of Lebanon and the central Roumieh prison also had a new centre as well as a new juvenile detention centre. A commission to tackle poor prison conditions was to be established as well as investigate alternative means to confinement. There was also the complete separation of juveniles from adult detainees. There were 23 prisons in Lebanon suffering from overcrowding. They were working on programs to rehabilitate prisoners as well, and reintegrate them in society. In terms of pre-trial detention, the legal system required that people detained for longer than 72 hours be registered, and article 47 of the criminal procedure code reminded the detainee of their rights to contact a lawyer and to have an interpreter. According to this article, arrested people could only be held for 48 hours, prolonged only with the accord of the attorney general. Under Decree 6236, the International Committee of the Red Cross could regularly visit thirteen prisons so independent investigations could be carried out about prison conditions and treatment of detainees. With regards to enforced disappearances, a delegate said that the Ministry for Human Rights was in consultations with civil society organizations and victims\u2019 families, while the future protocol with the International Committee of the Red Cross, already approved by the Ministry of Justice, would enable the collection of the DNA from family members to help with the identification of the disappeared. The right to knowing the fate of their family members would be enshrined in law, while a national committee established to this effect would have centralized archives to help detect the locations where those persons had been buried, essentially in mass graves. Abortion was prohibited and therapeutic abortion was allowed only if the mother\u2019s life was at risk; outside this scope, a judge might grant abortion under \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d recognize the concept of \u201chonour crimes\u201d, but there had been a provision in the Criminal Code which had allowed it. The Chamber of Deputies had repealed in 2011 that article which had granted extenuating circumstances to the person killing or mistreating his wife, one of his ascendants or descendants or his sister because of adultery or unlawful sexual intercourse. Questions by Committee Experts In the continuation of the interactive dialogue, an Expert said that although there were no secret detention centres under the Ministry of Defence, there were allegations that such centres existed, and that children were detained, and even died there. The labour law excluded migrant workers\u2014primarily women\u2014from its provisions and placed them under the sponsorship system, also known as the kafala, which gave absolute control of the employer over the status of the migrant employee, and making migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Lebanon hosted a huge number of refugees and provided continued aid to those refugees despite the burden they placed on the country, Experts noted with satisfaction and asked about the regulations in place that resulted in the restricted access to asylum procedures and push-backs at the border with Syria. There were reportedly 20 cases of refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly Iraqi and Sudanese nationals, who had been deported from detention centres in 2017. Would the State Party adopt domestic framework for asylum or adhere to the 1951 Refugee Convention? There were also reports that refugees and asylum seekers were subjected to prolonged administrative detention and subjected to expulsion. How many migrants, refugees and asylum seekers were detained, on what grounds and how many among them were children? The mass surveillance of digital communications by the State Party had been reported, said an Expert, and that surveillance and subsequent interception of personal data was not compatible with the Covenant. Law 140 required prior judicial authorization for any interception of private communications and access to data but the Lebanese Prime Minister had the authority to circumvent this Law. The Expert asked if this surveillance was subject to independent oversight mechanisms and if Law 140 would be amended to ensure greater protection. The Committee expressed concerned about the lack of judicial independence and the absence of effective means for appeals. What was the status of the bill aimed at ensuring the independence of the judiciary? Three bills concerning the abolition of military courts were currently being discussed in Parliament \u2013 would they touch on the lack of the independence of judges or the use of the courts to impress political adversaries and suppress dissenting voices? The use of confessions extracted under torture, for example, was not considered grounds for appeal; civil society organizations documented at least eight cases where individuals had their confessions, given while under torture, were used against them in court. The Committee considered that defamation should be de-criminalized and the criminal code be reserved for only the most serious crimes. Provisions in the Code allowed for imprisonment for anyone who, for example, insulted the President or the flag, which was extreme. With regard to the right to access information, the Committee commended Lebanon on drafting that law as well as the update of a draft law that protected whistle-blowers in cases of corruption. The Constitution guaranteed the right to assembly, however during some demonstrations, including the 2015 protests related to the waste collection crisis and corruption and impunity for such acts, excessive force by security authorities had been used. When and how was force used by the authorities and were they trained on situations where using force was necessary? Experts were concerned about numerous reports of forced marriages among Syrian refugee girls and women, as well as rural women in Lebanon. What were the intentions concerning decriminalising consenting sexual relations between adults irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity? Could members of non-registered religious groups stand as candidates for election at national or local levels and what were the opportunities for their political and public participation? What concrete measures, including quotas or voluntary quotas, would be put in place to increase women\u2019s presence in decision-making positions? Lebanon continued to observe a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, but an Expert asked for clarifications on how many people had been killed by the death penalty. According to Article 24 of the Covenant, said the Expert, all children must be immediately registered after birth and were required to given a nationality. Still, many children in the country were stateless at birth, particularly refugee children. What was being done to simplify the birth registration procedure and what rights to nationality did children born to stateless parents had? Responses by the Selegation Responding to the question about the deportation of migrants, the delegation explained that the principle of non-refoulement was fully respected by the authorities: no person could be expelled if there was the slightest doubt that he or she could be subjected to torture in his country. Regarding privacy and censorship, intelligence interception did not interfere with private life. A safe Lebanon was a secure Lebanon, the delegation said, but using this intelligence was only in the interests of fighting terrorism and protecting Lebanon and its people. Regarding freedom of expression, the law stipulated that all audiovisual recordings must be controlled. The existence of a code of conduct that had classified artistic works was not contrary to freedom of expression; the broadcast of works that focused on Lebanon\u2019s diversity were encouraged and violent extremism, terrorism and hate speech were censored. An audiovisual bill was under consideration, and it would repeal prison sentences that can be used against newspapers. Domestic workers were protected by the law of obligations and contracts, as well as by the Criminal Procedure Code. Any mistreatment or withholding of salaries by employer could be lodged with a disciplinary board within the Ministry of Labour. To provide fair and equitable working conditions and to protect women from abuse and violence, the labour law required employers to give equal salaries to migrant workers, to be paid at the end of every month through a bank transfer or money wire. The workers were provided with 24 hours off and a 15-day annual leave as well as nine consecutive hours of rest per day. A guide published in the native language of foreign workers was given to them as soon as they arrived in the country. Audiovisual campaigns had been developed to raise awareness of employers concerning their obligations. \nTrade unions had a wide margin of freedom in Lebanon and a prohibition against social servants to hold a strike was now a theoretical thing. Protests had been held in 2017 to raise their wages, for example. Ad hoc or military courts had been created in 1968; they comprised 27 judges appointed by the Ministry of Justice and High Judicial Council. With regard to investigating minors in military courts, it was done in the presence of a juvenile protection delegate and they were only tried if they perpetrated a crime with adults; otherwise they were referred to a juvenile court. It was compulsory to have a defence council present in military court during the proceedings. Defence council would be appointed if the accused could not provide one. The delegation categorically denied the existence of secret detention centers and said that facts would be welcome, not allegations. The jury was an independent authority and all judgements were issued in the name of the Lebanese people, as consecrated in the Constitution. Draft laws promoting the independence of the judiciary were being discussed in Parliament and focused on the mechanism to appoint judges, how to appoint members of the Supreme Council and the budget of the judiciary. Lebanon had for the first time a Ministry dedicated to fighting corruption, and was responsible for, inter alia, illicit enrichment, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. A national strategy against corruption was in the process of implementation. Regarding birth registration, it was possible to register a child under the name of the Lebanese father or mother or both within 12 months of birth. It was also possible to register children of foreign parents born in Lebanon. A special mechanism had been put in place for the registration of Syrian children, even those older than 12 months; the mechanism also covered Palestinian refugees from Syria. The delegation said that 63 people had been sentenced to death. A draft law on early marriage removed the possibility for different denominations to set their own age of marriage, which would not be 18 years old; the new law would allow 16 years old to marry subsequent to the authorization of the parents and social entourage. A judicial authorization was required for the administration to register a marriage of a minor. The law also introduced penal sanctions for non-compliance and awareness campaigns for young girls to inform them that they could refuse to marry before the age of 18 was in place. Conferences and debated had been organized and a sub-committee had been established to deal with the political activity of women. There had been an increase in women\u2019s participation in decision-making positions because of those efforts. \nConcluding Remarks \nSALIM BADDOURA, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in his closing remarks thanked the Committee for a courteous discussion which would hopefully represent a milestone in the cooperation between Lebanon and this Committee. The Ambassador also noted with satisfaction the goodwill and flexibility which allowed for the completion of this interactive dialogue regardless of the strike by the United Nations personnel on 16 March.

Anne Sylvie Henchoz, Archipelago and Tempo (2017), at the exhibition of Swiss Art Awards, Basel 2017. \nArts at CERN pioneers new ways of bringing together artists and scientists, leads the conversation about art and science, and supports artistic creativity and curiosity towards fundamental research. Artists from all over the world are invited, through our cultural programmes, to spend time at CERN and work alongside particle physicists and engineers. \nToday, we announce the winners of Collide International and Collide Geneva. Both awards offer a fully funded residency of up to three months to one artist in each category in order to research new ideas and crossovers between artistic practice and scientific research at the largest particle laboratory in the world. \n\"Arts at CERN aims to break down the silos between arts and science, helping us to understand the world around us from different perspectives. It enriches all of us when barriers are overcome and new knowledge is enabled. We are grateful to all the participants in Collide International and Collide Geneva for helping us towards this goal and congratulate them on their achievements,\" says Charlotte Lindberg Warakaulle, CERN\u2019s Director for International Relations. \nCollide International is a three-month residency programme in collaboration with the UK\u2019s Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT) that provides a fully funded residency of up to two months at CERN and a month at FACT in Liverpool. A jury of experts in art and science selected Suzanne Treister as the winner of the international award. She will undertake a residency during spring 2018 to further develop her investigation \u2018Holographic Universe\u2019 and explore the artist\u2019s motivations and intentions through the history of art, from cave painting to modernism and global contemporary art, including outsider and psychedelic art, passing through the art of the ancient world, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Islamic art and the European Renaissance. Taiwanese artist Yu-Chen Wang and Danish artist Lea Porsager received Honorary Mentions this year and will be invited to CERN for a short visit as Guest Artists in 2018. \nThe Collide Geneva award was dedicated to performance and was assigned to the artists Anne Sylvie Henchoz and Julie Lang. They will spend three months at CERN during the autumn of 2018 further developing their project \u2018Space Time Energy\u2019 around the potential analogies between the human body and particles. Collide Geneva is a partnership between Arts at CERN, the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the City of Geneva to foster research on artistic expression and fundamental research. \n\" Today, artists from all over the world are invited to CERN, through our programmes, to explore new ideas and work alongside particle physicists and engineers.

The Council adopted resolutions to extend by a period of one year the mandates of   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic,   situation of human rights in Iran, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and   situation of human rights in Myanmar. In a resolution adopted without a vote, the Council decided to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea for a period of one year, and it requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide a full report at the Council\u2019s fortieth session on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts regarding accountability. By a vote of 27 in favour, four against and 16 abstentions, the Council decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and it requested the Commission of Inquiry to provide it with an oral update at its thirty-eighth session, as well as to present an updated written report at its thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions. The Council decided by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions, to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Iran for a further period of one year, and it requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the mandate at the Council\u2019s fortieth session and to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. In a resolution adopted without a vote, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for a period of one year, and it requested the Commission to present an oral update at the Council\u2019s thirty-ninth session, and to present a comprehensive written report at the Council\u2019s fortieth session. By a vote of 32 in favour, five against and 10 abstentions, the Council decided to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Myanmar for a further period of one year, and it requested the Special Rapporteur to present an oral progress report at the Council\u2019s thirty-eighth session, and to submit a report to the Third Committee at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly and to the Council at its fortieth session. Introducing draft texts were Bulgaria   Japan, United Kingdom, Qatar, Russian Federation, Sweden on behalf of a group of countries, and United States. Syria, Iran, South Sudan and Myanmar spoke as concerned countries, while Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was not present in the room to take the floor as a concerned country. Australia, Slovakia   Switzerland, Iraq, Belgium, Venezuela, United States, and Pakistan spoke in general comments. Cuba, Venezuela, China, Australia, Egypt, Mexico on behalf of a group of countries, Cuba, Brazil, Pakistan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, Philippines, United States, and Kyrgyzstan spoke in explanation of the vote. The Council at 3 p.m. will continue taking action on resolutions and decisions before it closes its thirty-seventh session. Action on Resolutions under the Agenda Item on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council\u2019s Attention Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.29 ) on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea , adopted without a vote, the Council reiterates the request\u2026 to the High Commissioner to provide a full report at its fortieth session on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability in its report to the Council; and decides to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 34/24 for a period of one year. The Council urges the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, through continuous dialogues, to invite and to cooperate fully with all special procedure mandate holders, especially   situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to give the Special Rapporteur and supporting staff unrestricted access to visit the country, and to provide them with all information necessary to enable them to fulfil such a mandate, and also to promote technical cooperation with the  . Bulgaria, introducing the draft resolution L.28   said for a decade, the European Union and Japan had been at the forefront of bringing the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to the attention of the Human Rights Council, starting with the creation of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, and later with the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry whose landmark report had been released four years ago. Despite recent high-level talks held between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea being an encouraging signal and a positive step toward the improvement of inter-Korean relations, the European Union and Japan remained deeply concerned by the human rights situation, with on-going, systematic and widespread gross human rights violations taking place in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, some of which might amount to crimes against humanity. It was in the common responsibility as the international community and as members of the Council to ensure that this precarious human rights situation continued to receive the attention it deserved. The draft resolution aimed to address the most pertinent issues related to the human rights situation, and it welcomed steps to strengthen the capacity of the   for Human Rights, including its field-based structure in Seoul. Japan, also introducing the draft resolution L.29, said the text recalled last year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly resolution that underscored very serious concerns regarding reports of abductions and other forms of human rights violations. The international community must continue to maximize pressure on, and strongly urge, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to take concrete steps for cooperation with the international community and for the early resolution of the abductions issue. The draft resolution would continue to encourage the   for Human Rights to expedite the process of strengthening its capacity and it welcomed the recent steps taken to this end. The draft resolution also decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for another year. Japan called on the Member States of the Council to support the adoption of this draft resolution by consensus, as had been done the previous year. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, was not in the room to take the floor as the concerned country. Cuba, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, noted that the draft resolution was a confrontational step taken towards the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. As a position of principle, Cuba objected to country-specific mandates as those violated the principles of non-politicization that should be the real principle of this Council. The road of respectful dialogue and non-selectivity, and respect of sovereignty of States, was the only way to resolve human rights concerns. Adopting resolutions like this one would not contribute to the mandate of the Council and Cuba could not support such resolutions. The draft resolution did not provide added value and would not achieve any progress in current issues facing the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, reiterated that the draft text was promoting policy against the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and stressed that the decision on measures concerning the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea must include the country itself. Since this was not the case, Venezuela objected to such an approach and dissociated itself from the resolution. China, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, stressed that human rights problems should be resolved through dialogue, and the promotion of a healthy human rights cause. The situation in the Korean Peninsula had recently experienced positive change, and China hoped that all parties would contribute to the amelioration of the situation. The draft text did not promote such an objective and China could not support the draft resolution by consensus. The Council adopted the draft proposal without a vote. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Syrian Arab Republic In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.38 ) on the human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic , adopted by a vote of 27 in favour, 4 against and 16 abstentions, the Council calls upon all Member States, especially members of the International Syria Support Group, to make renewed efforts to create conditions, including a comprehensive nationwide ceasefire, that support continued negotiations for a political solution to the Syrian conflict, under the auspices of the United Nations Office at Geneva, as only a durable political solution to the conflict can bring an end to the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law. The Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the continued use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic..., and expresses its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable; also recalls the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, and expresses grave concern at its findings that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the use of sarin on 4 April, 2017 in Khan Sheikhoun; and expresses grave concern at numerous continuing allegations of the use of chemical weapons in recent months and weeks, including in Idlib Province and Eastern Ghouta. The Council invites Member States to support actively the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, including by considering the provision of information and data on the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to provide adequate financial means for its functioning; and demands that all parties work towards a genuine political transition, including through the establishment of an inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers, and urgently work towards the comprehensive implementation of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), within the framework of the United Nations-led intra-Syrian talks in Geneva. The Council decides to extend for one year the mandate of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic; requests the Commission of Inquiry to provide an oral update   during the interactive dialogue at its thirty-eighth session, and to present an updated written report during an interactive dialogue at the thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions; and decides to transmit all reports and oral updates of the Commission of Inquiry to all relevant bodies of the United Nations, recommends that the General Assembly submit the reports to the Security Council for appropriate action, expresses its appreciation to the Commission for its briefings to members of the Security Council, and recommends the continuation of future briefings. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (27): Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States. Against (4): Burundi, China, Cuba and Venezuela. Abstentions (16): Angola,   Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. United Kingdom, introducing the draft text L.38 on behalf of a group of countries, said the human rights situation in Syria remained as urgent as ever. There was a need to continue shining a spotlight on the terrible events occurring in this country in which the people were enduring the devastating effects of conflict on a daily basis. The draft text had been shaped by the constructive participation of Member States, said the United Kingdom, and highlighted its importance as it renewed the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry. The United Kingdom welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings that the use of unguided bombs in the densely populated area of Atarib market by Russian fixed-wing aircraft might amount to a war crime. Qatar, also introducing the draft resolution L.38, said the text condemned all violations undertaken against the Syrian people and urged the international community to work to end impunity in Syria. The situation on the ground showed once again the disregard of Syria for the relevant United Nations resolutions. Qatar called for the full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 2401. The draft text under consideration condemned the targeting of civilian infrastructure and other atrocities, and stressed that all rights violators must be held accountable. Qatar reiterated the transparent manner in which the text was drafted. Russia, presenting amendment L.60, said that Russia could not support the draft resolution as submitted to the Council. The statement made by the United Kingdom had been excessively emotional and sought to mislead the international community. It was clear that the genuine purpose of this text was not concerned with the humanitarian needs or the needs of the people of Syria, but the desire to achieve politically motivated goals. The text aimed to shield illegal armed groups from responsibility for the crimes they committed - armed groups which the co-sponsors had provided with political, informational and armed support, and which continued to commit crimes, hold civilians hostage, destroy entire groups on the basis of religious and ethnic affiliation, torture women and children, and conduct mass killings. Nonetheless, the co-sponsors of the draft resolution tried to justify before the public opinion the investments and down payments they had made to these armed groups. Sooner or later those who supported jihadists would need to admit the choices they made, said Russia, noting that the draft resolution contained politicized words and distortions, which remained the hallmark of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other co-sponsors of this resolution. One could hardly have a positive view of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into Syria, said Russia, noting that it presented often unjustified and false information; at the same time, the more than $ 2.5 million that had been used by this Commission could have been used to truly protect and promote human rights, for example by providing technical assistance to the Government. The report contained accusations of the use of chemical weapons, but Russia was convinced that once Syria was freed, an impartial investigation must be conducted to investigate from where the illegal armed groups had received the components for the chemical weapons. The same applied for the supply chain of weapons and technology. The States that sponsored the draft resolution did not want to condemn all those who committed crimes and this desire was predicted by their need to protect and shield those who supported these armed groups; if they truly condemned all those who had committed crimes, then there should be no difficulty in accepting the amendment to the paragraph as proposed. The second amendment proposed by Russia was on the Syrian National Dialogue Congress which had taken place at the end of January 2018, and which was a vital part of the reconstruction of Syria. United Kingdom, as the sponsor of the draft resolution, requested a vote on amendment L.60. Australia, speaking in a general comment, noted that the human rights situation in Syria had been appalling for the past seven years, from the initial brutal response to protests in 2011 to the most recent atrocities in Eastern Ghouta. Australia deplored the use of chemical and other indiscriminate weapons, attacks on civilians, denial of humanitarian access, and the use of siege and starvation tactics, and said that the regime bore the responsibility for the suffering it caused to its own people. Surely it was time to say enough was enough, said Australia, recalling that the Security Council resolution 2401 had already requested an immediate ceasefire. Australia urged all sides to find a political solution and extended its support to the Commission of Inquiry. Slovakia, speaking in a general comment   said that the resolution not only condemned violence but also called for an immediate action to implement Security Council resolution 2401, and expressed full support for the United Nations led efforts to secure a political solution. The European Union welcomed the extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, and noted that during the high-level panel on the violation of human rights of Syrian children and the presentation of the report by the Commission of Inquiry, this Council\u2019s session had witnessed heinous violations of human rights in Syria. Security Council resolution 2401 remained largely unobserved due to the continued ground offensive and aerial bombardment as well as deliberate targeting of civilians and medical infrastructure in Eastern Ghouta, by the regime supported by Russia and Iran. The European Union had allocated over \u20ac10.4 billion to date for humanitarian and resilience assistance to the Syrians, and the second Brussels Syria Conference afforded a further opportunity to establish peace. Finally, the European Union urged States to bring to an end the suffering of the Syrian people. Switzerland, speaking in a general comment, remained concerned over all the violations of human rights in Syria and commended the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission of Inquiry and the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism which would allow for their greater cooperation. Switzerland opposed the proposed amendment which attempted to weaken the draft resolution which reaffirmed the central role of the United Nations in promoting peace in Syria. Iraq, in a general comment, said that the world was witnessing the Syrian crisis enter its eighth year. The world must not ignore the adversities and challenges in Syria and it must address the conflict without selectivity in order to develop a comprehensive solution. Iraq had been involved in the consultations on the draft text and had attempted to make it more balanced; however, because the current version would not contribute to bringing an end to the conflict, Iraq would abstain from the vote. Belgium, in a general comment, said that Belgium would oppose the amendment tabled by Russia. The text of the resolution, as it stood, contained strong language condemning terrorism, while Russian proposals had no direct link with human rights and went beyond the currently agreed language in the United Nations. Belgium would vote against the amendment and urged other States to do the same. Venezuela, speaking in a general comment, supported amendment L.60 put forward by Russia and underlined the importance of its paragraph 7 which strongly condemned all terrorist attacks. Venezuela would vote in favour of the proposed amendment. United States, speaking in a general comment, strongly supported the draft resolution and the extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, and welcomed the resolution\u2019s strong condemnation of systematic abuses of human rights carried out by the Syrian Government and its allies. The conflict had led to the displacement of millions of people and the deaths of hundreds of thousands. The Commission of Inquiry had helped to provide necessary documentation to hold those responsible to account. The United States reiterated the call for a political solution to the conflict and called upon all Member States of the Council to support the draft resolution and vote no to the tabled amendment, which the Russian delegation had put forward after failing to participate in either of the two public informal consultations. Refusing to engage in negotiations and then filing last-minute hostile amendments undermined this Council and made a mockery of all those who had participated constructively in the negotiation process. Syria, speaking as the concerned country, said the draft resolution was not an acceptable approach to deal with the situation in the country. Co-sponsors of the draft sought to achieve political goals through the text. Those States had no legitimacy to present a draft on Syria as some continued to occupy parts of Syria or contributed support to terrorists in the country. The draft was an insult to Syria and ignored a long list of crimes committed by other States. The co-sponsors were using unreliable information and the draft lacked neutrality. Syria hoped that those speaking about the suffering of Syrians would address the recent bombings perpetrated by co-sponsors of the draft. The extension of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry would only serve to prolong the war, said Syria and called on the Council\u2019s Member States to vote against the draft. Action on Amendment L.60 Australia, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, strongly opposed the amendment, which Australia said would introduce new language on terrorism. The draft resolution already condemned all terrorist organizations as designated by the Security Council, and Australia was concerned that the amendment would be used to further justify the horrors on the population of Syria. The amendment also spoke of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress, but did not refer to the negotiated and agreed United Nations Security Council and the Human Rights Council resolutions. Australia agreed on the role of the Special Envoy on Syria appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and regretted that Russia had not proposed its amendment in the two open consultations. Australia would vote no on this amendment and encouraged all other States to do the same. The Council then rejected the amendment L.60, with 8 votes in favour, 25 against and 14 abstentions. Action on Draft Resolution L.38 Egypt, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said that Egypt was at a loss of words to express solidarity with the Syrian people who had been paying the price of the conflict for seven years. Egypt closely followed the situation and its impact on the Middle East at large, and said that Egypt usually rejected resolutions under agenda items 4 which were not accepted by the concerned State. The draft resolution continued to be unbalanced, especially when it came to the identification of perpetrators, and was using information from inaccurate sources. There was more than one reference to the International Criminal Court in the text and the position of Egypt in this regard was well-known, and additionally, Egypt had not supported the resolution that had established the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism. For all those reasons, Egypt would abstain from the vote. Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote that was also on behalf of Brazil, Peru and Panama, said that the report of the Commission of Inquiry had demonstrated serious human rights abuses. The draft resolution could have been more balanced and could have reflected different types of responsibilities that all State and non-State actors held. At the same time, Brazil, Peru, Panama and Mexico were concerned about the escalating situation in Syria and the lack of humanitarian access. Thus, those four countries would vote in favour, although they deeply regretted that their proposals had been rejected - they believed all countries should refrain from arms transfer that would further destabilize the region. There was a moral responsibility to reject gains generated from arms sales when such gains were obtained on the expense of lives of civilians. Cuba, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, reiterated its horror at the death of civilians in any circumstances and rejected approaches that singled out one party to the conflict as solely responsible. Interventionist agendas would not lead to a solution of the crisis and Cuba rejected persistent challenges to the territorial integrity of Syria. Cuba reaffirmed its support for a peaceful, just and negotiated solution to the conflict, and requested that the draft resolution be put to a vote, and said it would vote against it. Brazil, speaking in an explanation of the vote before the vote, remained deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Syria and expressed support for the renewal of the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry. All Syrians deserved respect for their human rights and human rights violators must be held accountable, stressed Brazil. Noting that the draft text retained imbalances from previous texts, it urged the Human Rights Council to unequivocally condemn the transfer of weapons that was exacerbating the conflict. Brazil also condemned any use of chemical weapons and said it would vote in favour of the draft. Pakistan, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said Pakistan was seriously concerned about the human rights of Syrians. The situation was grave, and the world could not afford a blame game and politicization. Pakistan believed in a solution that would respect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Syria and stressed that the challenges could only be overcome by a Syrian-led coalition. Pakistan also believed in a solution that would condemn violations by all sides. The killing of innocents must end, and for that, an impartial and non-selective approach was needed. There could not be favourites. Finally, Pakistan supported dialogue, and said that all parties must respect international humanitarian and human rights law. Pakistan had participated in the consultations in a constructive manner and had tried to balance the text; because the draft fell short of consensus and would reinforce divisions and not bridge them, Pakistan would refrain from voting for this draft resolution. China, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said China believed that a political solution was a fundamental approach to human rights in Syria and that the discussion should respect the Syrian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The international community should facilitate a political solution, mitigate the situation and combat terrorism. Since the draft resolution did not conform to those principles, it was not conducive to ensuring peace, and China therefore would vote against. Ecuador, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, expressed concern about the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by all parties to the conflict, and in particular the violations against refugees, medical staff, civil society groups, civilians, and protectors of cultural heritage. In many cases humanitarian aid was instrumentalized as a weapon of war. Ecuador maintained its position of not supporting resolutions against certain countries which prejudged situations and helped unilateral actions. Those resolutions did not help human rights in the countries concerned, they undermined a constructive dialogue, and compromised diplomatic solutions. Ecuador regretted that the draft resolution did not hold accountable all parties involved, which aggravated violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, destabilized the region as a whole, and exacerbated the negative impact of arms transfer and illicit arms trade. For all those reasons, Ecuador would abstain from the resolution. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said Venezuela would vote against the draft resolution and continued to condemn double standards contained in the L.38 which did not provide any benefits to victims of human rights abuses. Situation in Syria called for a genuine commitment to find politically negotiated outcome, taking into account national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Council then adopted the draft resolution L.38, by a vote of 27 in favour, 4 against and 16 abstentions. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.39 ) on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , adopted by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions, the Council decides to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran for a further period of one year, and requests the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the mandate   at its fortieth session and to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session; and calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to permit access to visit the country as well as all information necessary to allow the fulfilment of the mandate. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (21): Australia, Belgium, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States. Against (7): Burundi, China, Cuba, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Venezuela. Abstentions (19): Afghanistan, Angola, Brazil,   Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kenya, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo and Tunisia. Sweden, introducing draft resolution L.39 on behalf of a group of countries, said the draft was a short procedural text to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a period of one year. Sweden welcomed the work carried out by the previous Special Rapporteur, the late Asma Jahangir. Sweden noted the increased engagement of Iran with Special Procedures and urged Tehran to allow a visit to the country by the next Special Rapporteur. Sweden hoped the draft would be adopted by consensus. Slovakia, in a general comment   said the European Union remained committed to engaging in a constructive dialogue with Iran. The European Union supported the work of the Special Rapporteur and noted the improved engagement of Iran with the Special Procedures. The European Union called on Iran to fully cooperate with the next Special Rapporteur and invited all Human Rights Council members to join consensus on the draft. Pakistan requested a vote on draft resolution L.39. External interference through country specific resolutions was counterproductive. Iran had cooperated with the United Nations human rights bodies through the Universal Periodic Review and treaty body mechanisms. Iran had also accepted the majority of recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review, showing its willingness to adhere to international human rights standards. Engagement and not estrangement was the way to promote human rights. Since the draft resolution was not in conformity with views shared by Pakistan, Pakistan would vote against it. Iran, speaking as the concerned country, said that it firmly believed in the respect of human rights, which was why it had adopted a constructive approach, both internally and externally. The Government recently adopted amendments to the anti-narcotics law, which had been recognized as progress by the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. Iran was actively engaged in the implementation of recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review. In 2017, the landslide re-election of President Rouhani, who had campaigned on a platform of stronger human rights promotion, showed the importance that the country attached to human rights. Every delegate understood that the draft resolution on Iran was not about human rights aims, but about the continued abuse of the procedures for narrow political purposes. The authors of the resolution on Iran continued in their orchestrated efforts toward reproducing an unjustified and politically motivated resolution. The appointment of the Special Rapporteur for Iran was unnecessary and inappropriate. Iran reiterated its genuine intention to conduct constructive cooperation with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the Council thematic mandate holders. Australia, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, remained deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran and said it would like to see progress there. It appreciated the periodic reporting produced by the Special Rapporteur, which afforded impartial insight into the situation in Iran. It was saddened to learn of the death of the Special Rapporteur Asma Jahangir and looked forward to the appointment of a new Special Rapporteur in due course. Brazil, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it would abstain in the vote on the draft resolution on Iran. Despite legitimate concern on the human rights situation, Brazil welcomed the efforts by the Government to improve the situation. It noted the initiatives on reforming capital punishment as a first move in the right direction. Brazil hoped that this would bring about positive change. Brazil\u2019s decision to abstain had taken into consideration the Iranian political will to engage with the international human rights system, through the Universal Periodic Review and other mechanisms. Brazil\u2019s decision must be seen as an incentive for Iran to continue on a constructive track. Brazil remained concerned about human rights violations, especially of women, children, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious groups, among others, and took the opportunity to reaffirm the aspirations of the Bahai\u2019s to peacefully exercise their human rights in the country. It was saddened to learn of the death of the Special Rapporteur. Mexico, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it would vote in favour of the draft. The report presented by the late Special Rapporteur reflected persistent challenges in Iran and the growing desire in the country to work with the international community. Mexico welcomed Tehran\u2019s increased cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. Dialogue and cooperation were essential to strengthening the institutional capacity of States. Mexico remained concerned over the application of the death sentence and the human rights of women. Venezuela, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the draft did not promote dialogue and cooperation. The draft was an instrument for political confrontation and reflected the manipulation of a few super powers. Venezuela continued to reject selective practices targeted at certain States and would vote against the draft. Cuba, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said the mandate on Iran was a clear display of discriminatory practices against certain States. Cuba reaffirmed its opposition to country-specific mandates. Only a cooperation- and dialogue-based approach within the Human Rights Council could help promote and protect human rights. Mandates imposed without the consent of States were bound to fail. Cuba would vote against the draft. The Council adopted draft resolution L.39 by a vote of 21 in favour, 7 against and 19 abstentions. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in South Sudan In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.40 ) on the situation of human rights in South Sudan , adopted without a vote, the Council, deeply alarmed by the report of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, noting that some of the human rights violations may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, decides to extend the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, composed of three members, for a period of one year, renewable as authorized by the Human Rights Council, with the following mandate [inter alia]: to monitor and report on the situation of human rights in South Sudan, and to make recommendations to prevent further deterioration of the situation with a view to its improvement; to determine and report the facts and circumstances of, collect and preserve evidence of, and clarify responsibility for alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes, including sexual and gender-based violence and ethnic violence, with a view to ending impunity and providing accountability, and to make such information available also to all transitional justice mechanisms, including those to be established pursuant to chapter V of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, including the hybrid court for South Sudan, once established in cooperation with the African Union; and to report on the factual basis for transitional justice and reconciliation. The Council requests the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan to present an oral update   at its thirty-ninth session in an interactive dialogue, and to present a comprehensive written report, in an interactive dialogue,   at its fortieth session. United States, introducing draft resolution L.40 on behalf of the core group, particularly welcomed the productive dialogue with the Mission of South Sudan in developing the resolution before the Council. The situation of human rights in South Sudan as reported was deeply alarming. The report of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, presented to the Council last week, had detailed serious human rights violations and abuses and concluded they may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. It contained chilling accounts of looting and destruction of homes and villages; rape and other forms of sexual gender-based violence; violence against children; and extra-judicial killings on the basis of ethnicity. The report also underscored that the situation continued to be characterized by impunity. The resolution condemned in the strongest possible terms ongoing human rights violations and abuses in South Sudan. The world must come together to address these atrocities and put an end to the crisis in South Sudan. Through this resolution, the Council condemned violence by all sides, and encouraged domestic and regional efforts to foster a national reconciliation process and work to ensure accountability. In light of the Commission\u2019s report, it was clear that much work remained in carrying out the Commission\u2019s mandate, which this resolution would extend by a year. Through this resolution, the Council welcomed the Government of South Sudan\u2019s stated commitment to cooperate with the   for Human Rights, United Nations Special Procedures, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and regional, sub-regional and international mechanisms on the ground. The core group called upon the Government to honour that commitment and to give the mechanisms unhindered access and engage fully and constructively with them. It also reiterated its call for all parties to the conflict, to allow and facilitate the full, safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel, equipment and supplies free of unnecessary duties and taxes, and the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need, in particular to internally displaced persons and refugees. The Government of South Sudan was urged to sign the Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union to establish the Hybrid Court immediately. South Sudan, speaking as the concerned country, noted that the Government did appreciate the mutual spirit demonstrated by the United States and the core group in negotiating the extension of the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan. It was time to sign the Memorandum of Understanding with the African Union. The international community was urged to support the existing peace processes, including the national dialogue, which had been a vital peace process initiated by the President. Moreover, people to people peace initiatives promoted social cohesion. Finally, the High-Level Revitalization Forum on the Peace Agreement was a process led under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to prepare the ground for national elections. Those three tracks were complementary processes and had to be firmly supported to achieve lasting peace. South Sudan was born out of a long struggle for peace. South Sudan called upon the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Troika and the international community not to pursue sanctions but to complement the Government\u2019s efforts toward achieving a sustainable peace. Action on Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar In a resolution ( A/HRC/37/L.43 ) on the situation of human rights in Myanmar , adopted by a vote of 32 in favour, 5 against and 10 abstentions, the Council strongly condemns the reported widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations and abuses committed in Rakhine State since 25 August 2017\u2026, expresses its deepest concern about the disproportionate response of the military and the security forces and deplores the serious deterioration of the security, human rights and humanitarian situation, [and] the exodus of almost 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh; and calls for a full and independent investigation of the reports of systematic human rights violations and abuses committed, as reported by various United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Council independent international fact-finding mission. The Council decides that the fact-finding mission must ensure that the large and continually increasing amount of evidence of human rights violations and abuses it has collected is fully documented, verified, consolidated and preserved in order for the material to be effectively shared, accessed and used by credible justice mechanisms, and requests the Secretary-General to allocate the resources necessary for this to be done; and also decides to extend the mandate of   situation of human rights in Myanmar for a further period of one year, requests the Special Rapporteur to present an oral progress report   at its thirty-eighth session and to submit a report to the Third Committee at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly and to the Council at its fortieth session. The results of the vote were as follows: In favour (32): Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States. Against (5): Burundi, China, Cuba, Philippines and Venezuela. Abstentions (10): Angola,   Ecuador, Japan, Kenya, Mongolia, Nepal, Senegal, South Africa. Bulgaria, introducing the draft   said the Special Session called by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on the situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities last December had been a sign of the indignation of the international community toward the actions of the Myanmar military against the Rohingya in Rakhine state. The draft resolution voiced its condemnation of the abuses taking place in Myanmar. Human rights mechanisms established by the Council played a real difference on the ground and States should cooperate with mandates. The draft called on Myanmar to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur. Adoption of the draft resolution by consensus would send a strong signal of support to the Rohingya community. Australia, in a general comment, reiterated its deep concern about events in Rakhine state, including reports of systematic and widespread violations by the army and vigilantes and the clashes in northern Myanmar. It reiterated its call for an independent fact-finding mission, and called upon Myanmar to grant it unhindered access to all affected areas. All perpetrators of violence and crimes must be held accountable. Displaced persons must be allowed to return in a safe, dignified and voluntary manner in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights. It encouraged Myanmar to implement fully the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Myanmar. Implementation would be a long-term process. It welcomed the Government of Myanmar\u2019s engagement within the Bali Process on people smuggling, trafficking in persons, and transnational crimes, and stood ready to continue to support the country\u2019s democratic transition and its peace and national reconciliation at this difficult time. Myanmar, speaking as the concerned country, said that in its long march to a democratic society, it had faced daunting challenges in peace, national reconciliation and development. Maintenance of the rule of law and providing security for all in Rakhine state and the humanitarian situation there, were particular concerns for present-day Myanmar. As repatriation was an immediate step, the Government had carried out necessary preparations for reception. Regarding repatriation, the Government was ready to receive the list of people at any time. A Memorandum of Understanding between Myanmar and the United Nations Development Programme and   Refugees for their role in development and repatriation was in the making. While Myanmar did not abdicate its responsibility, the focus should be on the way forward for finding a sustainable solution for the future. At this juncture, the world should be concentrating its efforts to help Myanmar with humanitarian assistance and capacity building to alleviate and end the suffering of internally and externally displaced populations. The draft resolution, in PP7 mentioned \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Diplomatic corps and United Nations agencies had already witnessed that most of the Muslim population and their villages remained intact and they were assuming their daily livelihoods as before. If ethnic cleansing was happening, why had many chosen to continue to reside there? Furthermore, PP12 expressed ongoing intimidation and violence. There was no basis for this allegation. Representatives of diplomatic corps, all United Nations agencies and journalists had been to the Maungtaw area numerous times in January and February 2018 and had witnessed the active resumption of normal livelihoods. Operational paragraph 7 was holding the military and security forces accountable for the security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Maungtaw areas in Rakhine State. Myanmar noted that threats, reprisals, instigations, false hopes, forced recruitments and slaughtering the dozens of Hindus by ARSA had played a critical role in the abrupt change of the daily livelihoods of all people. Immediate and primary causes and effects should be analyzed more closely in a balanced and forward-looking manner. Operational paragraph 9 was factually flawed as there was no curfew order in the whole of Rakhine state. The usage of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in OP11 was incorrect, while with regard to OP13, Myanmar had never rejected the allegations. Operational paragraph 17 related to the collection of evidence of human rights violations and abuses, the credibility of which was crucial. Operational paragraph 23 on land confiscations was unreasonable, and OP8 was most intrusive. The situation in Myanmar was linked to the authority of the Security Council and thereon, to the International Criminal Court. There must be concrete evidence and legal determination to what constituted a crime related to violations and abuses of international human rights law. The notion of this paragraph was a threat and a direct challenge to the State\u2019s sovereignty. Although Myanmar saw some paragraphs acknowledging and welcoming the efforts made by the Government of Myanmar, the aforementioned factually-flawed, intrusive, sovereignty-infringing paragraphs had surpassed these. Against this background, Myanmar categorically rejected the draft resolution. China, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, was concerned about the situation in Myanmar and condemned the escalation of violence. The situation was now calmer and Myanmar and Bangladesh had been continuing their talks, so the international community should lend its support to the dialogue. China always believed in dialogue and respect of sovereignty and did not believe that pressure could result in some progress. Action taken by the Council had to focus toward the continuation of the dialogue between Myanmar and Bangladesh. The draft resolution which was put forward did not reflect the progress made by Myanmar in bilateral efforts and was only putting pressure and conflicting elements on the concerned country. China had participated in the resolution of the conflict and had contributed toward a peaceful solution, but the authors of the draft resolution had not taken that into account. The draft resolution did not create conducive conditions to dialogue, it did not reflect the interests of parties concerned and it would not alleviate the suffering across the region. China called for a vote on the draft resolution, and said it would vote against it. Japan, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it had been actively engaged in informal consultations to achieve a balanced text, however, Japan would abstain from voting. The safe return of the displaced was crucial and the involvement of   Refugees was essential so the decision of Myanmar to cooperate with   Refugees was important. Bangladesh was praised for its generosity in hosting the displaced population and the international community needed to provide appropriate assistance. The Government of Myanmar was urged to implement the recommendations of Kofi Annan\u2019s Advisory Commission. Japan was providing humanitarian and development assistance to Myanmar, including to Rakhine state, and the international community was urged to do the same. Philippines, in an explanation of the vote before the vote, said it had been following developments of a complex inter-communal issue in northern Rakhine state, including the positive developments in Myanmar. Concern was raised about the humanitarian situation. All acts of violence were condemned. The provision of humanitarian assistance was supported and the international community was urged to further assist Myanmar and its neighbour Bangladesh. Philippines did not support the international fact-finding mission as it rested on the wrong assumption that domestic investigative processes were not independent and credible. For that reason, the Philippines would vote no. The Council then adopted the draft resolution L43, by a vote of 32 in favour, 5 against and 10 abstentions. Explanation of the Vote After the Vote After the Conclusion of Taking Action on Resolutions under the Agenda Item on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council\u2019s Attention United States, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said it remained a leader in the fight against impunity for international crimes. The International Criminal Court could play a critical role by exercising its power judiciously and within the parameters of international law. The United States reiterated its serious and fundamental concern with the Court\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek an investigation into allegations against United States personnel in the context of the conflict in Afghanistan. Egypt, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, referring to the resolution on South Sudan, said it took great care to participate during the consultation process and to ensure human rights objectives were not politicized. Concerns remained over certain paragraphs in the draft, namely operative paragraph 15. Egypt broke consensus on operative paragraphs 15 and 16(b) of the draft. Turning to the text on Myanmar, Egypt said it was closely following the situation in Rakhine state. Egypt did not support dealing with human rights issues through resolutions not approved by the country concerned. Egypt voted for the draft but voiced reservations over operative paragraph 8. Kyrgyzstan, in an explanation of the vote after the vote, said it had not ratified the Rome Statute and therefore disassociated itself from the paragraph relating to this, in the resolution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "human rights council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "myanmar human rights council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "independent international commission of inquiry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission on human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic people\u2019s republic of korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:25:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "090f6b7205a359486c0ddc4b4ab35776ee69b549", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpUXjhVQR9dfclDaXKA3E3jBa40r3pIGsdR.BpQB9wNj6qs_9ASrxFk5iw8CKI_QDFFe6wrReDhQQvf79042rLy7ZPicYa4hB.5VbwsaxKHNMf0RRLYczh4SW7ZFjbDDvCIkeSMHTdw.HuBx55Bp5EHIDU5.ikWNiaPaZmrD3wrSbx8vFHlZouI99FZfMqVRSyybn86QJzF5CzQ2WzMMe40waBL1XEFMIfjfv0OSWg7cOmdiu7QJVWu9zHLzCQ4vZTDhz6e3N8djrn7ozjAqGBJjhEJFCarQCWAiqLmBS65A--", "site_full": "www.romandie.com", "site": "romandie.com", "site_section": "http://www.romandie.com/rss/flux.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Romandie", "title": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "title_full": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "published": "2018-03-23T09:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 52332, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "090f6b7205a359486c0ddc4b4ab35776ee69b549", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpUXjhVQR9dfclDaXKA3E3jBa40r3pIGsdR.BpQB9wNj6qs_9ASrxFk5iw8CKI_QDFFe6wrReDhQQvf79042rLy7ZPicYa4hB.5VbwsaxKHNMf0RRLYczh4SW7ZFjbDDvCIkeSMHTdw.HuBx55Bp5EHIDU5.ikWNiaPaZmrD3wrSbx8vFHlZouI99FZfMqVRSyybn86QJzF5CzQ2WzMMe40waBL1XEFMIfjfv0OSWg7cOmdiu7QJVWu9zHLzCQ4vZTDhz6e3N8djrn7ozjAqGBJjhEJFCarQCWAiqLmBS65A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T09:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet", "text": "M\u00e9dia suisse fond\u00e9 en 1997 - Toute l'information en temps r\u00e9el Min Max : 9\u00b0 C WISeKey International Holding SA - BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet WISeKey International Holding SA / BASELWORLD: WISeKey Introduced WIS.WATCH new generation of connected watches powered by VaultIC Semiconductor and embedded WISeCoin cryptocurrency wallet .

Der reisereporter ist schon heute bei der Jungfernfahrt mit dabei und testet das Fahrerlebnis. Hat der Zug von Flixbus das Potenzial zum echten Bahn-Konkurrenten? reisereporterin Andrea testet den neuen Bahn-Konkurrenten Flixtrain auf der Jungfernfahrt. Foto: Nils Peuse Anzeige \nGr\u00fcn macht Rot Konkurrenz. Dabei geht es nicht um Politik, sondern um den Bahnverkehr. Das Busunternehmen Flixbus wagt den gro\u00dfen Schritt: Mit dem Flixtrain k\u00f6nnte die Bahn einen echten Rivalen bekommen . Zun\u00e4chst f\u00e4hrt er auf zwei Strecken: Hamburg\u2013K\u00f6ln und Stuttgart\u2013Berlin. \nreisereporterin Andrea ist auf der Jungfernfahrt heute dabei und berichtet hier live aus dem Zug. \n13.04 Uhr : Angekommen! Und das mit nur vier Minuten Versp\u00e4tung. Eigentlich sollten wir um 13 Uhr in K\u00f6ln sein, jetzt sind wir da. Zur\u00fcck geht's sp\u00e4ter mit der Deutschen Bahn. Bis nach Hannover zahlen wir 73 Euro... Ganz sch\u00f6n happig im Vergleich. Mit einer Mini-Versp\u00e4tung von 4 Minuten erreicht der #Flixtrain K\u00f6ln. Chef #Andr\u00e9Schw\u00e4mmlein ist zufrieden: \u201eDas war eine tolle erste Fahrt.\u201c pic.twitter.com/dLpASi36ZR \u2014 reisereporter (@REISEREPORTERde) March 23, 2018 \n12.59 Uhr : Ich habe mit Flixbus-Mitbegr\u00fcnder Andr\u00e9 Schw\u00e4mmlein gesprochen. Er ist bisher zufrieden mit der Jungernfahrt. \u201eIch hatte sogar Zeit mit einigen Reisenden zu sprechen und vorne in der Lok mitzufahren.\u201c Es soll nicht bei zwei Flixtrain-Strecken bleiben, sagt er. \u201eWir wollen die Bereiche Bus und Bahn weiter ausbauen.\u201c \n12.25 Uhr: Lauter gr\u00fcne Z\u00fcge hier... spottet: Ein ICE mit gr\u00fcnem Logo. Das war auch Flixbusgr\u00fcnder #Andr\u00e9Schw\u00e4mmlein ein Foto wert. Er stieg kurzerhand aus und poste f\u00fcr sein Team. pic.twitter.com/sAecgBzTmW \u2014 reisereporter (@REISEREPORTERde) March 23, 2018 \n12.02 Uhr: Eigentlich soll\u2019s kostenloses WLAN geben. Bei mir funktioniert es leider nicht, und ich bin aufs mobile Internet angewiesen. Das l\u00e4uft im Zug aber auch nicht immer so, wie man es gern h\u00e4tte\u2026 Von anderen Passagieren habe ich aber auch geh\u00f6rt, dass das WLAN bei ihnen l\u00e4uft. \n11.55 Uhr: Die Tickets starten bei 9,99 Euro. Studentin Nele Eichten aus Hamburg findet Zug und Service f\u00fcr den Preis \u201evoll okay\u201c. Flixbus: Das Bordbistro ist ein kleiner Verkaufswagen \n11.50 Uhr: Das Bordbistro, der \u201eSnack Point\u201c, ist ein kleines R\u00e4umchen. Eine Verk\u00e4uferin kommt mit einem Servicewagen durch den Zug. Es gibt kalte Getr\u00e4nke, Kaffee und Snacks. Find ich eigentlich ganz nett. \n11.17 Uhr: Ich habe mit ein paar Passagieren gesprochen. Einige finden den Retro-Look gem\u00fctlich. Andere bem\u00e4ngeln, dass sie nicht f\u00fcr sich sitzen k\u00f6nnen und dass noch keine Platzreservierung m\u00f6glich ist. Au\u00dfen gr\u00fcn, innen blau: Der #Flixtrain von @FlixBus . Hier kann man in alter Bahnnostalgie schwelgen... pic.twitter.com/5azqLcvtg9 \u2014 reisereporter (@REISEREPORTERde) March 23, 2018 \n10.50 Uhr: Nicht in allen Abteilen gibt es Steckdosen, daf\u00fcr werden Powerbanks ausgegeben . \n10.30 Uhr: F\u00fcr die Strecke Hamburg\u2013K\u00f6ln kooperiert Flixbus mit dem Unternehmen Bahn Touristik Express, das auch die Z\u00fcge bereitstellt. Und das sind nicht gerade die neuesten. Es gibt keine offenen Sitzreihen wie beim IC oder ICE, sondern nur Abteile mit sechs Sitzpl\u00e4tzen. \n9 Uhr: Der Flixtrain hat Hamburg-Altona p\u00fcnktlich verlassen. 600 Sitzpl\u00e4tze h\u00e4tte der Zug, 400 Passagiere fahren mit, darunter auch Politiker wie Ex-B\u00fcrgermeister Ole von Beust. Bahnbrechend: Der Premierenzug von #Flixtrain von Hamburg nach K\u00f6ln. pic.twitter.com/HoBNvPi83v \u2014 Zugreiseblog.de (@zugreiseblog) March 23, 2018 Was Zugfahrer vom Flixtrain erwarten k\u00f6nnen: \nFast so schnell wie der ICE: Zwischen Hamburg und K\u00f6ln braucht der Flixtrain etwa viereinhalb Stunden. Der ICE schafft die Strecke in etwa vier Stunden. \nG\u00fcnstige Preise: Die Flixtrain-Preise bewegen sich zwischen 9,99 Euro und 29 Euro auf der Strecke Hamburg\u2013K\u00f6ln. Das Auto- und Verkehrsportal Stau.info hat 16 Hin- und R\u00fcckfahrten auf den bereits von Flixtrain bedienten Strecken ausgewertet und festgestellt, dass die Tickets im Schnitt 75 Prozent g\u00fcnstiger waren als bei der Deutschen Bahn. Mit den Spartickets f\u00fcr 19,90 Euro k\u00e4mpft die Bahn schon seit einigen Jahren gegen die Konkurrenz auf der Autobahn und nun auch auf der Schiene. \nVergleichsweise kleines Streckennetz: Vorerst sollen nur zwei Strecken, zwischen Hamburg und K\u00f6ln und zwischen Berlin und Stuttgart , befahren werden. Das allerdings f\u00fcnf- bis sechsmal die Woche, erkl\u00e4rt Flixbus. Ab Sommer soll die Taktung erh\u00f6ht werden. \nWLAN: Internet soll in den Flixtrains \u201eje nach Netzabdeckung verf\u00fcgbar sein\u201c, so das Unternehmen. \nDas Projekt steht noch am Anfang, das Potenzial zeige sich aber jetzt schon, sagt Bettina Engert von Flixbus dem reisereporter: \u201eWir freuen uns schon seit dem Buchungsstart am 6. M\u00e4rz \u00fcber eine enorm gro\u00dfe Nachfrage. Innerhalb der ersten 24 Stunden haben wir schon Tausende Tickets verkauft.\u201c Zun\u00e4chst will das Unternehmen die Strecken von zwei verschwundenen Gesellschaften weiterf\u00fchren: Die des Hamburg-K\u00f6ln-Expresses (HKX) und ab April auch die von Locomore zwischen Stuttgart, Kassel und Berlin. \nDer Flixtrain wird analog zum Flixbus-Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell betrieben. Das hei\u00dft, das Unternehmen k\u00fcmmert sich um Ticketverkauf und organisiert das Streckennetz. Betrieben wird der Flixtrain aber nicht von dem Fernbusanbieter, sondern auf der Strecke Hamburg\u2013K\u00f6ln vom BTE (Bahn Touristik Express) aus N\u00fcrnberg. Zwischen Berlin und Stuttgart ist der Betreiber Locomore. Mit dem Hipster-Zug hatte Flixbus bereits kooperiert, nachdem das Bahnunternehmen im August 2017 Insolvenz angemeldet hatte . Flixbus plant Start in den USA \nGo big or go home \u2013 das scheint das Motto von Flixbus zu sein, das Unternehmen plant f\u00fcr diesen Sommer den Start in den USA . Dann sollen auch in Kalifornien gr\u00fcne Busse rollen.

Das Spotlightthema in Stuttgart hei\u00dft dementsprechend \u201eData-Driven HR\u201c: \nDenn der demografische Wandel stellt Unternehmen vor enorme Herausforderungen, wenn es darum geht, qualifizierte Mitarbeiter zu finden. In mittelst\u00e4ndischen Unternehmen fehlen h\u00e4ufig die HR-Kapazit\u00e4ten, um neuen Trends zu begegnen. W\u00e4hrend Personaler bisher ihre Arbeit vor allem telefonisch erledigten oder Kandidaten durch langwierige Recherchen in Online-Netzwerken identifizierten, bringt eine softwarebasierte Suche meist schnellere und bessere Ergebnisse. Algorithmen erm\u00f6glichen das genaue Erfassen und Analysieren der F\u00e4higkeiten der potentiellen Mitarbeiter. Doch wie lassen sich die neuen M\u00f6glichkeiten effektiv in den Unternehmensalltag integrieren? Die Keynote Speaker in Stuttgart geben Anregungen f\u00fcr ein Personalmanagement der Zukunft, das Mitarbeiter jeden Alters online und offline erfolgreich zusammenbringt. Dr. Bodo Anton\u00edc und Sascha Lobo sind Keynote Speaker \nWenn es um die Digitalisierung und ihre Folgen f\u00fcr die Arbeitswelt geht, darf der Vordenker, Blogger und Autor Sascha Lobo nicht fehlen. In seinem Keynote-Vortrag auf der Zukunft Personal S\u00fcd erl\u00e4utert er, welche Chancen die Digitalisierung bietet und wie er sich die Arbeitswelt von morgen - jenseits der Festanstellung - vorstellt. Dr. Bodo Anton\u00edc hingegen bef\u00fcrchtet, dass die menschlich-emphatische Herangehensweise beim Recruiting den digitalen M\u00f6glichkeiten zum Opfer f\u00e4llt. Er pl\u00e4diert f\u00fcr mehr Logos und (De)mut im Personalmanagement. \nAls Verleger hat sich Keynote Speaker Dr. Florian Langenscheidt schon fr\u00fch mit Chancen und Risiken der Digitalisierung besch\u00e4ftigen m\u00fcssen. Auf der Zukunft Personal S\u00fcd wird er die Besucher ermuntern, eine eigene digitale Erfolgsstrategie zu entwickeln. Und Nicole Reimer, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerin von IBM, wird anhand von Best-Practice-Beispielen aufzeigen, welche wichtige Rolle die Mitarbeiter bei Change-Prozessen spielen. Trendthemen \u201eWorking Out Loud\u201c und K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz in Podiumsdiskussion \nEs ist un\u00fcbersehbar: Die Digitalisierung und Globalisierung r\u00fccken das Individuum in den Hintergrund und f\u00f6rdern kollektives Denken und Arbeiten. Das Ergebnis ist \u201cWorking Out Loud (WOL)\u201c, eine Revolution des Kollaborationsgedankens. Wie f\u00fchrt man Netzwerke in Unternehmen ein und was n\u00fctzen diese? WOL-Protagonisten geben auf der Zukunft Personal S\u00fcd Einblick in ihre Arbeit und m\u00fcssen sich einem Kritiker stellen, der als \u00dcberraschungsgast geladen wird. \nMit der Frage, wie K\u00fcnstliche und Soziale Intelligenz erfolgsstiftend werden, befasst sich eine weitere Podiumsdiskussion. Dabei stehen insbesondere rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen im Mittelpunkt. Neue Formate: \u201eWorkshops\u201c und \u201eMeet the Blogger\u201c mit Simone Janson \nWie kann das Personalmanagement neue Power gewinnen und Innovationstreiber werden, statt nur auf Ver\u00e4nderungen zu reagieren? Wie k\u00f6nnen Agilit\u00e4t, Mitarbeiterbeteiligung und erfolgreiches Konfliktmanagement die Attraktivit\u00e4t des Unternehmens f\u00fcr potentielle Mitarbeiter steigern? In den neuen interaktiven Workshops auf der Zukunft Personal S\u00fcd k\u00f6nnen sich die Teilnehmer mit Branchenexperten in praxisnahen und l\u00f6sungsorientierten Sessions zu aktuellen Themen und Fragestellungen austauschen. \nBlogger sind aus der HR-Medienlandschaft nicht mehr wegzudenken. Nicht nur aufgrund ihrer Expertise. Oft sp\u00fcren sie als erstes die neuesten Trends auf und berichten schneller als klassische HR-Fachmedien \u00fcber neuste Entwicklungen und Tools. Im Rahmen des Formats \u201eMeet the Blogger\u201c, das es nun auch neu auf der Zukunft Personal S\u00fcd geben wird, stellen einige dieser Vordenker ihre Erkenntnisse vor - darunter auch Simone Janson, Herausgeberin von Best of HR - Berufebilder.de , die am 25.04. mit ihren Zuh\u00f6rern \u00fcber die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung von HR diskutieren will.

The top of the wheelhouse was torn off, and the 33 year old master was injured. An ambulance took him to hospital. The unloaded ship was disabled and berthed close to the Gartrop Bridge. In the early afternoon it was taken to a yard for repairs. The \"Synthese 4\" had been underway from Duisburg to Hamburg at the time of the accident. The canal authority and the police investigated the bridge for possible damages, but it was found safe and sound. The cause of the accident was yet unclear. The bridge has a passing height of 5,5 meters, so the barge may not have taken on enough ballast water or lowered the wheelhouse enough to pass underneath.

Not only are individual bottle and packaging designs in demand but also wide-neck containers for sauces, dressings and dairy products. In order to give bottlers in this field the greatest possible flexibility, KHS has now further developed its InnoPET Blomax stretch blow molder. The systems supplier is also extending its Bottles and Shapes program for distinctive bottle design. \nFaster, more variable and more efficient: KHS has now further developed its InnoPET Blomax stretch blow molder for PET container filling. \u201cThis latest improvement enables preforms measuring up to 70 millimeters in diameter to be processed\u201d, says Frank Haesendonckx , head of Sales and Technology at KHS Corpoplast in Hamburg, Germany. The machine is available as a modular design with an output of up to 2,500 PET bottles per hour and station. \nPET and wide-neck containers are becoming more important to the food industry in particular, with this type of packaging steadily growing in popularity for products such as sauces, dressings or dairy products. To quote Haesendonckx, \u201cPET has a number of advantages over glass, such as its unbreakability and low weight\u201d. Another plus point is that sensitive products can also be filled into transparent plastic packaging thanks to KHS\u2019 FreshSafe PET coating method. Already tried and tested many times over in the beverage industry, this process finishes the inside of the PET bottle with a wafer-thin layer of pure silicon oxide. \u201cThis barrier gives products a shelf life which is comparable to that of glass\u201d, states Haesendonckx. \nCan be blocked with other systems \nDepending on user requirements the stretch blow molder can be blocked with other KHS systems \u2013 not just with the InnoPET Plasmax for container coating but also with the Innosept Asbofill for the hygienic filling of sensitive products, for instance. The new KHS chunk dosing unit for flexible product design, which adds fruit, vegetables or cereals, can also be integrated into the system. \u201cWe\u2019re vastly expanding the application options and providing system solutions for new markets\u201d, claims Haesendonckx. \nIn combination with KHS\u2019 Bottles and Shapes bottle design program the systems supplier provides all-round service. Together with the customer KHS develops individual PET containers specifically tailored for functionality. \u201cWe offer all producers of food and beverages in PET containers holistic consultancy from the design through technical engineering to production of their PET bottles\u201d, says Haesendonckx. The aim is to produce bottles with a high level of brand recognition which clearly stand out from those of the competition, bottles which can be produced cost effectively through lightweighting and which have a high degree of consumer affinity. The preferential heating system developed by the KHS Group also ensures optimum material distribution and bottle quality while using less energy in the stretch blow molding process. Very precise neck orientation is possible specific to the application, even in the manufacture of very oval containers, assures Haesendonckx. This creates the best possible synchronization between packaging and line production.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank haesendonckx", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "khs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khs corpoplast", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:00:01.004+03:00"}], "totalResults": 27, "moreResultsAvailable": 17, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745877695&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3ADE+location%3AHamburg&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 914, "extra": {"place": "Hamburg", "country": "DE", "lat": "53.5510846", "lng": "9.9936819"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "51e93db885969457d3fd0de66f0460f689538ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.ncBl.li0wK_ji982KaYfNFssriWMruFTmyVVuuAwVq0HQFFFGMlFmxIZJaKEKVJqTV0Bv2dqeMy5LPcaKfNJ0kJnZRjjZAL1Bv4eHY4S3Wqig--", "site_full": "yle.fi", "site": "yle.fi", "site_section": "http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yle News | Tuoreimmat uutiset", "title": "Easter witches make the rounds as part of age-old Finnish custom", "title_full": "Easter witches make the rounds as part of age-old Finnish custom", "published": "2018-03-25T15:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article10132558.ece/ALTERNATES/w940h529/Palmusunnuntai,%20p%C3%A4%C3%A4si%C3%A4inen,%20noita,%20virvonta,%20virpoja,%20vitsa-%2039.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 2555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 229, "comments": 0, "shares": 229}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51e93db885969457d3fd0de66f0460f689538ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.ncBl.li0wK_ji982KaYfNFssriWMruFTmyVVuuAwVq0HQFFFGMlFmxIZJaKEKVJqTV0Bv2dqeMy5LPcaKfNJ0kJnZRjjZAL1Bv4eHY4S3Wqig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T15:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Easter witches make the rounds as part of age-old Finnish custom", "text": "updated 25.3.2018 15:46 Easter witches make the rounds as part of age-old Finnish custom Most of Finland celebrates Palm Sunday with the same tradition: children dress up and go door-to-door collecting sweets in return for a willow branch. Finland's Palm Sunday tradition brings witches to the door Image: Antti Haanp\u00e4\u00e4/Yle \nWitches, cats and bunnies are out this Sunday, carrying willow branches ornamented with bright feathers and tissue paper. They might show up at your door, where they will recite a rhyme wishing you health for the following year. The youngsters will then expect Easter candy in trade for the branch, which you get to keep as a memory of their visit. \nReminiscent of the trick-or-treat tradition in the British Isles and North America, this practice is believed to be a mixture of Orthodox Easter blessing customs from Eastern Finland with pre-Christian rituals from Western Finland and Scandinavia. \nIn the northwestern region of Ostrobothnia, kids wait until the Saturday before Easter to partake in the tradition. \nUnna Nummelin from Helsinki put her costume together in the morning, complete with an apron and a scarf for her head. A bit of red rouge on her cheeks and she is transformed into an Easter witch. The tradition requires that the children dress as witches, but in the last few decades, the dress code has been expanded to include all manner of costumes. \n\"I'm not nervous about it anymore. We'll just knock on doors until we run out of branches,\" she says. \nLaura Larres was part of a three-person team that decorated branches for the big day. \n\"I had intended to prepare them during the youngest child's nap, but he didn't end up sleeping very long, so it ended up being a pretty hectic decorating process. I think this is a great tradition, even so. It is rewarded to see the children having fun,\" she says. Unna Nummelin has several years of Palm Sunday witching under her belt. She is trying her luck this year in the Helsinki district of Maunula. Image: Antti Haanp\u00e4\u00e4/Yle Chocolate eggs seem to be the treat of choice.

Image: Mikko Savolainen/Yle \nA dozen solar panels gleam in the sun on the roof of a semi-detached house in Herttoniemi, eastern Helsinki. In March, some of the panels are still covered with snow, but the homeowner says that the longer, brighter spring days are already spurring a noticeable increase in electricity production. \n\u201cYesterday we had an output of 1,000 watts. Sometimes the summer it gets up to 3,000 watts a day,\u201d says homeowner Timo Juutilainen. \nWith a gently-sloping south-facing roof on the seashore, the location is ideal for solar energy production in northern Europe. Juutilainen installed the panels two years ago and has been satisfied with how they work. \nA month ago, the family put in an electricity storage unit that retains electricity generated by the panels for 3-4 hours. \nStory continues after photo The inverter tracks how much energy is being produced. Image: Ari Tuhkanen / Yle \n\u201cI want to store the electricity that\u2019s produced during the day so that we can use it in the evening and at night. Up until now, most of the electricity we\u2019ve produced has gone back to the power grid for quite a small compensation fee,\u201d explains Juutilainen. \nFinland's energy regulator allows only small tax breaks for the installation of solar capacity by households, and excludes solar power entirely from the feed-in tariff system intended to encourage renewable energy production by offering set prices for electricity generated by some renewable sources. \nThe government has no targets for solar energy production, preferring to focus renewable energy policy on wind power, biogas and forest industry products. Keep your own power for your own use \nSolar energy storage batteries for private homes are a relatively new concept. Juutilainen\u2019s unit was installed by Helsinki city power utility Helen, which only began offering the product to homeowners late last year. The company estimates that such units can boost solar panels\u2019 capacity utilisation factor to more than 90 percent. \n\u201cWith storage, you avoid having to transfer your own production to the network, where you don\u2019t get very good compensation, and there are no signs that you will be able to do so within the foreseeable future,\u201d says Kristiina Siilin, project manager at Helen. \nThe nominal storage capacity of Helen\u2019s solar electricity packages ranges from six to 16 kilowatt-hours (kWh). \nSeveral other storage unit alternatives for small houses are available on the Finnish market. For instance Naps Solar Systems, also based in Helsinki, sells batteries with a capacity of 4-16 kWh. Meanwhile an Espoo firm, Eaton, plans to bring units with 4.2-9.5 kWh storage capacity onto the market this year. \n\u201cThe batteries are the same as those used in Nissan cars,\u201d notes Pasi Pesonen, an executive at the company. \nStory continues after photo The storage unit fits in beside a coat-rack. Image: Ari Tuhkanen / Yle \nThe Juutilainens\u2019 storage unit is about the height and width of a large refrigerator, but only 25 cm deep. The storage unit must always be set up in a warm indoor location. The control unit is on a wall in the front hall, along with the inverter, which gauges how much energy is coming in. Ecological, not financial reasons \nThe Juutilainens have invested about 20,000 euros in their solar system, and have not made exact calculations as to how long it will take to pay for itself. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t dared to figure that out, because I guess that it probably won\u2019t pay off for at least 20 years. The usage costs are nil, though,\u201d says Juutilainen. \nSiilin acknowledges that buying solar panels and a storage unit does not yet make sense in purely financial terms. \n\u201cThe fact that you save on electricity transfer fees and taxes is not enough to make it profitable within the equipment\u2019s lifetime, but generally the values in these investments come from somewhere else besides the payback time,\u201d says Siilin. \nFor Juutilainen, the investment was motivated by a desire for more environmentally sound energy production. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it for business reasons but for ecological reasons. I also wanted to show the others in our housing association that they could install one of these, too,\u201d says Juutilainen. Prices set to drop \nElectricity storage units are still new, expensive products, so sales have been minimal so far. For instance, Helen has only sold a few of them. \n\u201cThere are several installations underway and several other customers are interested. But we expect sales to pick up,\u201d says Siilin. \nNaps Solar Systems says it has installed about 10 storage units for detached houses in the Uusimaa region so far. \n\u201cAt the moment, these are being bought by people who're interested in technology and those who want to produce their own energy,\u201d says sales director Markus Andersen, who also chairs the Finnish solar technology association. \nGrowth expectations are high at Naps too, though. \n\u201cWithin two years, buying solar panels and electricity storage units will become financially viable and demand will rise significantly,\u201d predicts Andersen, based on price trends for solar electricity systems and developments in battery technology.

Image: AOP \nThe elderly being conned out of their money and jewelry is nothing new. What is new, though, is how brazen criminals have become in exploiting the trust of older people. \nSwindlers have expanded their range of fictitious professional guises beyond the well-known police imposters to include fake social workers, taxi drivers, bank officers, nurses, and repairmen. \nLast week, police in eastern Uusimaa warned the public of frauds targeting the elderly. On Friday, Helsinki police issued a similar warning. \n\"There have been close to 20 cases. They are being investigated as a number of different crimes, including theft, attempted aggravated theft, fraud, payment fraud, minor fraud and attempted fraud,\" Helsinki Police Detective Chief Inspector Kari Martikainen told Yle. \nThese cons have netted perpetrators bank cards, cash, jewelry and bank account security codes. Targeted at shopping centres \nA new trend among these criminals is to use various pretexts to approach elderly people at shopping centres and to follow them home. \nOnce there, the swindler, often impersonating an official or professional some some sort, presents a plausible story to gain entrance and rifle through the senior's belongings. \nOne woman suspected of conning elderly people once used the ruse of offering free incontinence products. Another time, she claimed to need to check a victim's medical alert phone, and once requested money for a medical monitoring bracelet. \n\"They are well behaved the whole time, none of these elderly people have said they were pressured,\" relates Kari Martikainen. \nAccording to Martikainen, the suspects have been fluent Finnish, or in some cases, Swedish speakers. \nPolice recently took two women into custody on suspicion of carrying out these kinds of scams. Both have confessed to some of the charges. \nMartikainen has advice for people involved with care for the elderly about how to protect them from being exploited. \n\"We urge professionals who work with the elderly, as well as volunteers, to be alert to this and to tell seniors about the danger of getting conned. It's important to tell the elderly and their families in detail how, for example, to recognize a legitimate home care nurse,\" says Chief Inspector Martikainen.

Protesters at the March 24 event Image: Kimmo Hiltunen / Yle \nIntense discussion of nursery teacher wages in Finland snowballed into a protest in Helsinki on Saturday. A citizens' group that calls itself \"Ei en\u00e4\u00e4 leikkirahaa (No more play money)\" was the instigator of the demonstration in early March on social media. \nThe movement was sparked by a March 5 story from the public broadcaster Yle in which the teachers' union OAJ accused the capital city municipalities of creating an unofficial \"gentleman's agreement\" to not pay higher salaries to hire competent daycare teachers, despite hundreds of vacancies and a severe shortage of skilled professionals. \nThe municipal leaders of Espoo, Helsinki, and Vantaa later denied that any such verbal agreement was in place. \n\"The pact seemed so immoral; we just had to man the barricades. People are very dissatisfied and they feel as if their wages are extremely unfair,\" said Pauliina Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, one of the organizers of the group, which received over 10,000 likes on Facebook after it was established. Average salary: 2,300 euros per month \nThe minimum monthly salary for daycare teachers in the three municipalities currently stands at around 2,300 euros. This payment is often even a few hundred euros smaller per month for workers in private daycare institutions. \nMany people at the Saturday event called for monthly wages in the sector to be raised to 3,000 euros. Some of the banners at the protest read \"A calling doesn't pay the bills\", in reference to arguments that wages have remained low because people tend to think that people who pursue daycare work do so because they answer a calling to their vocation. \nThe union of daycare teachers in Finland has called for a salary increase to 3,000 euros to match that of teachers in primary and secondary schools, and the OAJ has concurred. \n\"Daycare teachers carry out demanding and valuable work that not only benefits the children, but also the entire society,\" OAJ chair Olli Luukkainen said in statement in support of the demonstration on Friday. Future of early childhood education at stake \nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4 said she was pleased that the demonstration attracted so many participants. She says it will give her group the impetus to continue the fight until daycare wages are improved. \nJari Miettinen was one of the people drawn to the protest. He changed careers and abandoned his work as a daycare teacher after he burned out.

Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nOn 23 March the Parliamentary house opens its doors to 400 students of lower secondary schools across Finland for Youth Parliament day. The event is held once every two years, with 2018 marking the 11th Youth Parliament Day. \nThe Youth Parliament is organised in cooperation between the Parliament of Finland and the Development Centre Opinkirjo. It is the culmination of parliamentary club activities in schools for 15 to 16 year-olds and has been organised since 1998. \nBlack jeans and smart shirts are expected to be sported for the formal event as 15-year old Julietta Nylund walks the steps up to Parliament with a question for the ministers in mind. \nThe question is no small undertaking, as the parliament club of Helsinki\u2019s Porolahti lower secondary school have mulled over the issue since the start of the year. Topics of residency, poverty, and of course the presidential election have been suggested. \nNylund and Olavi Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, another parliamentary club comrade, are avid followers of politics who regularly tune into the evening news and flick through the pages of daily newspapers. \nThe teens enjoy lunchtime discussion topics of world politics and Finnish news at school, but admit the conversations are fairly superficial. \n\u201dI would not lower the voting age limit. Many people our age have a fairly narrow view of politics,\u201d said Nylund. \nStory continues after photograph Julietta Nylund will ask ministers about expensive living conditions. Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nAbove all, the youths hope for candor from politicians. \n\u201dThey are great speakers, that part is obvious, but I wish that they would state their own opinions more clearly,\u201d said Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \nNylund on the other hand would encourage politicians to smile more. \n\u201dPoliticians look so serious. A lot of my friends have the opinion that politicians are quite stuffy with no sense of humor.\u201d A step from schools to politics \nPoliticians will have a chance to hone their facial skills as a record number of students participate in this year\u2019s Parliamentary Youth day. A total of 154 schools will get the chance to send a student representative, as well as one journalism student and one club director. \n\u201dThe new curriculum promotes getting involved and being an influencer, and it shows,\u201d said Tiina Karhuvirta, senior advisor and Youth Parliament organizer at Development Centre Opinkirjo. \nAccording to Karhuvirta, in past years the relationship between schools and politicians has been at times an issue of wary caution, as some teachers still feel reluctant to invite their district MP to their classroom. \nHowever, this mindset is a dwindling notion as the younger generation of teachers approach the topic with progress in mind. \n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that old traumas hamper my job. Civics studies is such a fruitful subject when looking at the development of the real world,\u201d said Laura Parikka, civics teacher at Porolahti school. \nStory continues after photograph Mikael Mikkonen dreams of a politician and musician's career.

A student at Vesala upper secondary school, Mikkonen joined the parliamentary club as soon as it started up. \nMikkonen knows he is the school's odd bird because of his strong political opinions. \n\u201cConservative and Christian values are close to my heart. Home, religion, the mother country, and the preservation of these three are of great importance to me.\u201d \nIn current affairs, Mikkonen has focused on the politics of immigration and economic policies. The progress of Sote, the social and healthcare reform, is also of interest. \n\u201cIt feels like such a maze,\u201d said Mikkonen on the topic of Sote, \u201cI can\u2019t really keep up. But it is interesting to follow.\u201d \nWhile Mikkonen himself is a socially conscious individual, he ponders how politicians could reach the youths of this day and age. \n\u201cPoliticians should go to the youth, go to where they are and read the climate of what\u2019s going on. If they only hang around campaign tents, they will only meet the adult voters.\u201d \nStory continues after photograph Mikael Mikkonen will represent Vesala school in the Youth Parliamentary day. Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nWhen asked about his question for the ministers, Mikkonen said it was one which echoed his own values. \n\u201cThe intention is to ask about Christian traditions in schools and daycares. It is not an attack against any minority, but it really is a disservice to immigrants if we\u2019re constantly toning down our own traditions. It also makes integration more difficult.\u201d \nAfter the question hour planned for the teens, Mikkonen has said he plans to do a bit of networking and hopes he will have a chance to talk with a few cabinet ministers. \n\u201cI hope I could meet Laura Huhtasaari and P\u00e4ivi R\u00e4s\u00e4nen.

It would be disbursed to those who are entitled to unemployment benefits. \nThe task force also argues that the basic security would increase predictability and work incentives by introducing an activity-based supplement and harmonising the concepts and calculation rules of social security benefits. The basic security would decrease as the recipient\u2019s earnings increased but never to the extent that working becomes not worthwhile. \n\u201cThe incentives would be considerably better than the current ones. The proposal would increase social assistance costs by no more than six million euros,\u201d the task force tells. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juho saari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juha sipil\u00e4", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T18:03:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4c0e953c672464a1a6e7f7acb387467362f7e18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neUX6vo5sKrfHjkjUQadjObNums0pZxrjgkYmBonPtvqMMwFAyrFDFBovn9wD8H9rlfVFZe4sbhX._Bw9FesHw3uMHQyN8Epy7uiEAbBg6dQ2fvbendWtODC05141ANLkA-", "site_full": "yle.fi", "site": "yle.fi", "site_section": "http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yle News | Tuoreimmat uutiset", "title": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "title_full": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "published": "2018-03-22T16:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article10128990.ece/ALTERNATES/w940h529/Jan%20Vapaavuori%20Helsingin%20pormestari%2020180206%20IMG_5079%20EDIT.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4c0e953c672464a1a6e7f7acb387467362f7e18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neUX6vo5sKrfHjkjUQadjObNums0pZxrjgkYmBonPtvqMMwFAyrFDFBovn9wD8H9rlfVFZe4sbhX._Bw9FesHw3uMHQyN8Epy7uiEAbBg6dQ2fvbendWtODC05141ANLkA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T16:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "text": "updated 22.3.2018 16:44 Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care Finland's most populous province, Uusimaa, faces 300 million euros in budget cuts as part of a planned reform of health and social care. Image: Antti Kolppo / Yle \nMunicipal leaders and decision-makers of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa are pressing hard for changes to the government's planned reform of social and health care, known as ' sote ', as the full scale of funding cuts in the country's most populous region becomes clear. \nSome 300 million euros in spending cuts are projected in the government's preferred model, which aims to expand competition and private provision in healthcare while simultaneously transferring responsibility for it from municipalities to newly-created regional governments to be elected this year. \n\u201dThis kind of planned overhaul is not good. People haven't understood all the risks [involved],\u201d said Juha Metso, Espoo's director of basic social services. \nMarkus Syrj\u00e4inen, Espoo city council's Director of Finance and Administration, produced figures this week projecting that the Uusimaa province, which includes the Helsinki area, will face a 300-million-euro shortfall in the first year of the new system. \nThe figure includes transitional expenses that would accompany the shift away from municipal responsibility for providing health care. Another portion is made up of the increasing demand for services by an ageing population. As thousands of new residents flock to the Helsinki region each year, health and social care provision must grow in proportion. \nLeaders in the Helsinki metropolitan area have said that such transitional costs had not been taken into account in calculations made by the Ministry of Finance. Hunting for cuts \nLeading the rebellion is Jan Vapaavuori, the National Coalition Party Mayor of Helsinki who has declared trenchant opposition to the reform advanced by the government coalition that includes his own party. Vapaavuori's power base is strong, with some 30,000 people voting for him in the last municipal elections, and his party includes other critics of the reform including liberal-minded MP Elina Lepom\u00e4ki . \nTheir critique is two-pronged. The new regional governments, which are dear to the rural Centre Party , have no tax-raising powers and therefore no incentive to reduce costs. Private providers, meanwhile, could be incentivised to cherry-pick young, healthy customers and leaver the older, sicker and more expensive patients for public providers to pick up. \nThe chunk of money cut from budgets in the Uusimaa region will be the most substantial due to its population of 1.6 million--nearly a third of the total population of Finland. \nMunicipal leaders interviewed by Yle estimate that of the 300-million-euro deficit that Uusimaa will face, Helsinki will have to cough up 100 million euros per year, Espoo 50 million, and Vantaa 40 million euros. The remainder would be left for the rest of Uusimaa to come up with. \n\u201dThe equivalent to losing 100 million euros per year in Helsinki would be giving up the entirety of child protection services. That gives you an idea of the scale that we are talking about,\u201d says Helsinki deputy mayor Hanna Vesikansa. \nAccording to the Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council, the financial deficit would decrease over time, but not by much. In 2030 the deficit would still be 100 million euros for the entire Uusimaa region. Baby steps \nThe Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council have agreed with government officials that weekly negotiations will be held to thrash out funding issues. In addition, the leaders of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area said the transition should be carried out with patience and in baby steps. \n\u201dThis should be done in the same manner as the primary education reform was done back in the day. Start from small provinces and proceed step by step,\u201d said Ritva Viljanen, mayor of Vantaa.

Image: Derrick Frilund / Yle \nA citizens\u2019 initiative calling on the government to reverse a Helsinki city decision to build housing on the current location of the Malmi Airport was thrown out of the Parliament on Wednesday. \nMPs did not vote on the motion as Speaker Paula Risikko ruled that the proposal was essentially unconstitutional. \nLate last year, the citizens\u2019 initiative ran into a hurdle when Parliament\u2019s Constitutional Law Committee deemed that reversing the decision by Helsinki city authorities would be unconstitutional, because it would fetter municipal sovereignty. \nLex Malmi, as it came to be known, roiled the parliament and the government during last spring\u2019s local government elections and also spawned a grassroots movement to reverse the decision to build housing on the site of the historic airfield. \nAt the time, Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4 even said that his administration would be willing to step in to preserve the location for light aviation on certain conditions. The main criterion would be finding a suitable area in the city to construct much-needed housing by way of a land swap. Appeals point to cultural importance \nCritics of the plan to construct homes on the airfield have pointed to its historical significance. Completed in 1938, the terminal building designed by architects Dag Englund and Vera Rosendahl is considered a prime example of functionalist architecture. \nIn 2016, the state withdrew its support for the light aircraft airport. Once state airports operator Finavia halted operations at the airfield, the Malmi Airfield Association stepped in to maintain the facility, which is an important site for pilot training. \nThe City of Helsinki has zoned the area for residential development for 25,000 residents. If this scale of housing development were to be implemented, the airfield would not be able to continue in operation. \nOther efforts to preserve the airfield included declaring it a site of historical and cultural significance.

According to the indictment , Bennett allegedly injured a a 66-year-old paraplegic, who was working security at NRG Stadium. \nBennett was at the game to watch his brother, Martellus, who was playing tight end for New England. After the Patriots beat the Falcons 34-28, Michael was trying to get down to the field when the incident happened. According to the indictment, Michael was trying to shove his way on to the field when security personnel informed him that he would have to take another entrance. Apparently, Michael didn't listen to their request and he decided to push through security at the field entrance he wasn't supposed to be using. \nDuring the pushing, a 66-year-old disabled female was injured. The indictment for the case came down on Friday from a Harrison County (Texas) jury. The punishment for the charge carries up to ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \nPolice in Harris County have issued a warrant for Bennett's arrest. According to prosecutors in Harris County, authorities are working with Bennett's team in regards to his surrender. The indictment comes less than three weeks after the defensive end was traded from the Seahawks to the Eagles. \nThe incident in Houston was one of two times that Bennett had a brush with the law in 2017. The 32-year-old was also involved in an incident in Las Vegas in August. During that incident, Bennett claimed he was racially profiled by members of the Las Vegas Police Department following a skirmish at a nightclub after the Mayweather-MacGregor fight.

Bennett was told to use a different field entrance, but he pushed through the security detail, which included a 66-year-old paraplegic woman in a wheelchair, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference. The woman suffered a sprained shoulder in the February 5, 2017, incident, Acevedo said. Seahawks' Michael Bennett: Trump stooped so low with his NFL attacks \"It's offensive to me that a man who's supposed to be an example, a professional athlete, thinks its OK to act like this,\" Acevedo said. Read More Bennett's legal team does not have a comment at this time, Frank Perez, a member of the team, said Friday night. CNN reached out to Bennett for comment through his representative Doug Hendrickson but has not heard back. Harris County said the felony charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Bennett was one of the most vocal NFL players in protesting the national anthem before games. He appeared on CNN and said he didn't understand why President Donald Trump would \"stoop so low\" as to say that NFL owners should fire players who protest. Bennett, 32, played with the Seattle Seahawks for five seasons and just signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played high school football in Houston and college ball at Texas A&M University. Acevedo said Bennett's lawyer has been notified. The chief said Bennett has not been arrested yet but should turn himself into police as soon as possible. When asked why it took more than a year to file charges against Bennett, Acevedo said police had to prioritize more serious crimes. Also, Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August, he noted. Acevedo said an officer at the game witnessed Bennett pushing the woman but decided to check on the elderly woman rather than immediately arrest Bennett, whom he recognized. \"We knew who the suspect was,\" Acevedo said. \"We knew what he had done and we knew where to find him.\" The Philadelphia Eagles said in a statement Friday: \"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\" Last September, Bennett complained that police in Las Vegas unfairly singled him out, threatened him with a gun and detained him briefly after he attended a prizefight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor. Las Vegas authorities said officers were responding to a call of battery and assault with a gun that had turned into an active shooter situation and thought that Bennett might be involved.

Mr. Washington said he still wonders if race had something to do with the attack. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Ora Houston, an African-American councilwoman here, stood as a proclamation was read inside City Hall on Thursday.\nIt had nothing to do with the Austin serial bomber, Mark Conditt. It had to do with a deeper, older and far more invisible hurt \u2014 the 90th anniversary of a 1928 city plan that created a \u201cNegro district\u201d on the east side of town.\n\u201cThe Negro district was intentionally created by the Austin City Council to force Negros and Mexicans who lived in other parts of Austin to move to the Negro district,\u201d Mayor Steve Adler said as Ms. Houston, a longtime East Austin resident, looked on at his side. \u201cAnd the effects are apparent in the racial and economic disparities found in East Austin today.\u201d\nThree of the five bombs that terrorized Central Texas this month went off in East Austin, where the majority of the city\u2019s black and Hispanic residents live, prompting the police to investigate them as possible hate crimes. When the fourth bomb was planted in an upscale gated and largely white community west of Interstate 35, the issue of race disappeared from most official statements \u2014 a fact that has stirred deep resentment among many black residents. The only two people killed, many have been quick to point out, came from two of the city\u2019s most prominent black families.\n The debate over how to characterize the bomber\u2019s nearly three-week campaign of violence has been a reminder, for many, of the ways in which race, geography and class continue to play out in a city that prides itself on tolerance and diversity.\n Though Austin is widely seen as a liberal island in a deeply conservative state, the attacks have stoked the raw racial, economic, political and geographical divisions that continue to shape life here, 90 years after the city was segregated by decree. Austin and its suburbs remain sharply divided by class, race and even religion. Like Houston, it is an urban, diverse and Democratic hub surrounded by largely white, Republican suburbs, including Pflugerville, Mr. Conditt\u2019s hometown.\n\u201cAustin has gradually started to become aware and conversant about its race issues over the past five years, so the initial suggestion that these bombings could be race-related made people deeply nervous that the problem could be that bad,\u201d said Cecilia Ball\u00ed, a writer and cultural anthropologist who lived in Austin from 2008 to 2014 and who now lives in Houston. \u201cWhether or not the bomber\u2019s motive ends up being race, this brought to the forefront one of the city\u2019s challenges and worst fears.\u201d\nThe police have said that Mr. Conditt, who is white, gave no indication in a 25-minute confession left on his phone that he was driven by racial hatred. News emerged Thursday that one of the explosive packages he sent at a FedEx store was addressed to a spa employee who is white. His past statements, including the views he expressed on a community college blog opposed to gay marriage, have added to speculation that he was anti-gay.\nIn East Austin on Thursday, Daniel Arriaga, 51, a furniture mover, said he still believed the bomber had a hatred for blacks and Hispanics. He had harmed the two white victims, Mr. Arriaga theorized, \u201cjust to throw it off.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In his hometown Pflugerville, about 20 miles northeast of Austin, the mayor, Victor Gonzales, is Hispanic. One of the candidates who ran against him was Philip Emiabata, who was born in Nigeria. One of Mr. Conditt\u2019s roommates was black. And one of his friends was Sierra Davis, a transgender woman and Marine veteran who is part Hispanic.\n \u201cHonestly, Mark was a lot like I was,\u201d said Ms. Davis, 23, who got to know Mr. Conditt when they were teenagers. \u201cHe was a home schooler, Christian, and I was the same. I mean, we were all awkward at the time. Growing up, Pflugerville had a small-town feel to it. It was a lot more conservative than Austin, a lot more home-school friendly.\u201d\nMs. Davis said that Mr. Conditt told her she was \u201cgoing to hell\u201d when she was transitioning. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t surprised by what he said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were raised like that and I was tied to those beliefs, too.\u201d\nIn Austin, I-35 has long been recognized as the dividing line separating most of the city\u2019s minority residents from its white population, and much of its have-nots from the haves. That dividing line has an ugly, decades-old history. In an online examination of the city\u2019s racial and economic divide by The Austin American-Statesman, a real estate ad circa 1915 reads: \u201cHyde Park is exclusively for white people.\u201d\nJesse E. Washington, 68, a retired city inspector who is black and was born and raised in Austin, lives in a small ranch house his parents built in the 1960s in East Austin. He graduated from a segregated high school in 1967.\n\u201cIf you wanted to buy a home and own property in Austin, you could only get your utilities turned on if you were in East Austin,\u201d Mr. Washington said.\nNow, of course, East Austin is far different.\n\u201cIf you walk up and down here you see the white kids walking their dogs and riding bicycles,\u201d he said. Many of his black neighbors, he said, \u201chave sold off.\u201d\nPhoto A mural in East Austin depicting influential African-American and Latino icons. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Mr. Washington lives next door to the scene of one of the explosions, the one that killed Draylen Mason, 17, an African-American classical musician whose grandfather was a well-known dentist. The blast woke Mr. Washington around 6:45 a.m. that morning. At first he thought it was a falling tree limb.\nMr. Washington listened with interest to the police chief\u2019s description of Mr. Conditt\u2019s confession. But he said he still wonders if race had something to do with it.\n \u201cYou know, the possibilities are endless,\u201d he said. \u201cThese mental conditions that are in our minds growing up, the influences people have from the older generations.\u201d\nBlack leaders and residents have accused the police of failing to take the first bombing seriously because the victim was black, an accusation that police officials have denied. At the time of the first bombing on March 2, the authorities believed it was in retaliation for a drug raid the police had conducted on a similar-looking house on the same street three days beforehand.\n\u201cWe had a pretty strong working theory that day that led us to believe it was an isolated incident that day,\u201d the Austin police chief, Brian Manley, told reporters recently. \u201cIt was very unique. We had no information to believe it was related to a larger plan at that time.\u201d\nThe bombings have come at a critical time for the city\u2019s black population. A 2014 University of Texas report highlighted the drastic decline in the number of black residents in Austin, even as the city has boomed. Austin\u2019s overall population growth rate was more than 20 percent between 2000 and 2010, making it the third-fastest growing city in the country. But the number of African-American residents declined by 5.4 percent \u2014 making it the only one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the United States to experience a loss in black population.\nIt was the result, the researchers wrote, of \u201cpersistent structural inequalities.\u201d The emerging tech industry was not hiring black and Latino residents. People of color were losing trust in the public schools on the traditionally black east side.\nMs. Houston, the city councilwoman, said she now occasionally feels unwelcome in restaurants in the east side neighborhoods where she grew up, and which are becoming whiter.\n\u201cAs a black female they look at me like, \u2018Why is she here?\u2019\u201d she said.\nRace has played out here in the backdrop of the case in other ways. KVUE, an ABC-affiliated TV station in Austin, issued an apology, after the words \u201cthis monkey\u201d appeared in a sentence about Mr. Mason during its breaking-news coverage of the bombings. KVUE\u2019s closed-captioning provider, VITAC, issued its own apology and said the error was \u201cnot intentional.\u201d\nKVUE said it had severed ties with VITAC \u201cdue to the terrible mistake.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "austin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cecilia ball\u00ed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conditt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pflugerville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:29:36.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fda2316b161be013a03af6a26b17cd12ce0f6c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2M8sQoApIexdQjkZVzVOvBnUc7kNatISLT1riKV0CQieVDuvuPUbCwx0FzNij0PBPHGvD1RtBW_O8f5b6hkq8cdg--", "site_full": "www.cosmopolitan.com", "site": "cosmopolitan.com", "site_section": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/contenttype/news/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News ", "title": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "title_full": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "published": "2018-03-24T12:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-03-24-at-9-10-23-am-1521907847.png?crop=1.00xw:0.862xh;0,0.0386xh&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1970, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2765, "comments": 0, "shares": 2765}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fda2316b161be013a03af6a26b17cd12ce0f6c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2M8sQoApIexdQjkZVzVOvBnUc7kNatISLT1riKV0CQieVDuvuPUbCwx0FzNij0PBPHGvD1RtBW_O8f5b6hkq8cdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cosmopolitan.com", "published": "2018-03-24T12:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Andrew Turley Jailed for Trying to Sell 4-Year-Old Daughter for Sex", "text": "A Wisconsin man who tried to sell his 4-year-old daughter for sex was sentenced to 60 years in prison.\nKHOU reports that Andrew Turley, 30, was convicted for trafficking of a child and compelling prostitution of someone under the age of 18.\nIn 2015, Turley placed a Craigslist ad with the title, \"Play with Daddie's Little Girl.\" According to the district attorney's office, in subsequent emails with undercover police officers, Turley wrote that he had a girl who was \"younger than 10\" and he would give her \"sleep meds\" before the encounter.

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett has been indicted for a felony charge of injury of the elderly in Houston\u2019s Harris County, and a warrant is out for his arrest. Bennett allegedly injured a 66-year-old paraplegic who was working at NRG Stadium during Super Bowl LI. The employee was controlling access to the field for the game. The incident allegedly happened after the game, when the Patriots had completed their comeback and won the Super Bowl. Bennett \u2019s brother, Martellus, was a tight end for the Patriots in the game. From the Harris County office of the district attorney : Immediately following the game, Bennett shoved his way on to the field where players were gathering to celebrate. NRG Security personnel, including the 66-year-old disabled victim, told Bennett he had to use a different entrance for field access. Instead, he pushed through them, including the elderly woman who was part of the security team. The charge, injury to the elderly, includes intentionally and knowingly, causing bodily injury to a person 65 years or older. According to the Harris County release, prosecutors are working with Bennett\u2019s counsel regarding his surrender.

McMaster's Choice - The Atlantic", "text": "By Eliot A. Cohen The Atlantic Read bio March 24, 2018 Before he was the national-security adviser, he wrote a lacerating account of generals who failed in advising Lyndon Johnson. What will he say now that he is free to talk about Trump? \n\u201cThey have their exits and their entrances,\u201d wrote Shakespeare, and so it is, as we see some actors deliver frantic speeches while others leap, slide, or crawl on and off the foreign-policy stage. \nRex Tillerson said farewell to the Department of State much as he entered it: clueless about government service, clueless about his department, and clueless about his boss. He invoked the clich\u00e9 of Washington as a \u201cmean-spirited town\u201d\u2014as though executive suites in Houston were foreign to nastiness, and as though the capital were demonstrably short of the amiability that characterizes Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, or Las Vegas. He could not accept the true diagnosis of his failure: that he had chosen to work for an immoral egomaniac who predictably treats his subordinates\u2014and treated him\u2014as shabbily as he has betrayed his wives and allegedly attempted to buy his sex partners. \nAt almost the same moment that Tillerson was delivering his meagerly attended soliloquy, National-Security Adviser H. R. McMaster was similarly given the boot. The world was notified by tweet of his dismissal, but the exchange of compliments between the general and the commander in chief was more civil. Like Tillerson, McMaster had been surprised by his initial job offer; like Tillerson he never established a rapport with the president; like Tillerson he suffered repeated humiliations and put-downs from a boss who shared neither his decency nor his regard for public service. But Trump was a bit more gentle in this case: perhaps because he has a sneaking affection for generals, who are, in his parlance, \u201ckillers.\u201d He may also have reflected that in addition to a moralistic streak, McMaster has a temper and a gift for effective writing. \nTillerson and McMaster were good men who answered an unexpected call to serve. Their motives to do so probably included some admixture of ambition or vanity as well as patriotism. They themselves may not know the proportions of such motivations, human nature being the complex compound of pure and impure impulses that it is. They are being replaced by considerably more canny and political figures, Michael Pompeo and John Bolton, whose policy instincts are more in tune with Trump\u2019s tough-guy swagger, but more importantly who are much more skilled at manipulating the president. Neither McMaster nor Tillerson were cynics, and both were Washington outsiders. To find their successors, the president has turned to a corner of the very swamp he had once promised to drain. A former congressmen and a long time in-and-outer are, after all, creatures from the reeking fens, even if they hail from a distinctively boggy corner of the Washington wetlands. Subscribe   \nThe mix of personalities in high office matters more than ideology, particularly with a president so ignorant and unrooted as this one. Bolton; Pompeo; a weakened and not overly principled chief of staff, John Kelly; and an obsequious vice president, Mike Pence, will collectively tend to facilitate Trump\u2019s more pugnacious foreign-policy inclinations. They will attract a darker, angrier, and more aggressive set of subordinates, together with a larger number of opportunists, and in both categories, mediocrities. Who else, after all, would choose to serve in an administration so chaotic, so badly managed, so besieged with special counsels, weekly sex and expense-account scandals, trade wars, disdainful allies, impending electoral debacles, simmering conflicts with a variety of foreign powers, and, on top of it all, indictments and possibly even impeachment looming in the years ahead? Ultimately, they will probably clash with the one remaining foreign- and security-policy outsider, who is also the administration\u2019s most important moderate, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. The new team makes dangerous policymaking even more likely in an already fraught world. \nTillerson will probably retreat to Texas and lick his wounds. He may or may not write a memoir: He does not need the money, and although there are ghost writers aplenty to assist him should he choose to do so, his discomfort with the written word would make for a clunky tale. If he writes a memoir it will probably be an attempt to retell and justify his brief, unhappy time as the country\u2019s chief diplomat rather than to indict the administration. \nMcMaster is a different case, whose choices will be more consequential. He will retire from the Army, a course he would have been well-advised to take before taking office. He is not wealthy; he has strong convictions at odds with those of Trump; he is known for his forceful views of right and wrong; he probably would rather have been a four star. And above all, he has already written one powerful book, and now has the opportunity to write another. \nDereliction of Duty, McMaster\u2019s revised Ph.D. thesis on the Vietnam War, made his literary name, presenting as it did a powerful and well-researched case that the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the mid-1960s failed candidly to present and argue their position to President Lyndon Johnson. It is a good book, although it should be noted that LBJ fully understood that the JCS wanted to do more in Vietnam and faster, but chose not to take that course for a number of reasons. Furthermore it is far from clear that the Chiefs\u2019 preferred approach would have made a useful strategic difference. Indeed, it might well have precipitated a clash with China not all that dissimilar from that of the Korean War. No matter: Dereliction of Duty deservedly made a splash when it came out in 1996. \nThe book was a successful young combat veteran\u2019s expression of righteous anger against superiors of an earlier generation whom he thought had failed to speak truth to power. It became the middle-aged general\u2019s hundred-pound rucksack when, much to his surprise, he was plucked by Donald Trump from imminent retirement to become national-security adviser. It became an implicit measuring rod against which any public official would probably fall short. And when McMaster began publicly to praise the president, to echo his dystopian view of international politics, to cover for his reckless compromises of intelligence material, there was no shortage of commentators keen to pounce. \n]McMaster now has a choice. He can simply remain silent about his time in government and his views of the Trump administration\u2019s methods and policies\u2014highly unlikely given his nature and the financial incentives to speak out. He may, alternatively, choose to make only restrained criticisms in a careful memoir; or he may, in accordance with both his character and temperament, write a volcanic account, perhaps angry and self-justifying, but insightful, blunt, cathartic and even, in some way, redeeming. \nThe national-security adviser had to, or in some cases chose to, say things that his inner nature must have abhorred. As a scholar trained by one of the best military historians in the country, for example, McMaster knows just how rancid a slogan America First is, what dangerous and even vile policy sentiments of 1940 and 1941 it reflected. It will be a hard memoir to write if he confronts that and other facts. Whether he chooses to do so will say something about him, of course, but something too about the readiness of decent and prominent men and women who have served or justified this administration to face the truth. From start to finish, the question about Trump and those who have served, supported, or opposed him has come down to character. McMaster\u2019s memoir, should he write one, will, in many ways illuminate the battering to individual integrity the president has caused. It may also indicate whether the cuts can heal, leaving scars, as one hopes, rather than suppurating wounds. Eliot A.

Michael Ainsworth / AP Email \nHOUSTON -- A grand jury has indicted Philadelphia Eagles player Michael Bennett for allegedly injuring a 66-year-old paraplegic woman when he tried to get onto the field at last year's Super Bowl to celebrate with his brother, Martellus Bennett. Michael Bennett, a three-time Pro Bowl defensive end, was indicted on one felony count of injury to the elderly, the Harris County District Attorney's Office announced Friday. \nThe charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. \nAuthorities said Bennett, 32, was a spectator at the game in Houston when he tried to get onto the field immediately after the game to see his brother, a tight end for the Patriots at the time. Prosecutors said he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old disabled woman who had told him to use a different entrance to access the field. Medical records show that the woman suffered a sprained shoulder, police said. \nCBS affiliate KHOU reports that the injured worker has been with security management Contemporary Services since 2013. The company said she's an \"excellent\" employee\" and they are \"proud to have her.\" \nA warrant has been issued for Bennett's arrest, and prosecutors are working with his lawyers to plan his surrender. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles earlier this month acquired Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles released the following statement on the alleged incident: \n\"We are aware of the situation involving Michael Bennett and are in the process of gathering more information.

He was the flight commander charged with landing on the moon. After an oxygen tank exploded, Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise had to call off their mission and figure out how to get back to Earth.\nTwenty-five years later, actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in a Hollywood film about their epic journey.\nApollo 13 astronauts Fred Haise, James Lovell, and John Swigert (left to right) leave a helicopter to step aboard the carrier Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean after their successful recovery. | AP\nWe\u2019d like to give this American hero, who lives in a north suburb of Chicago, a shout-out as he turns 90 Sunday. Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium is celebrating Lovell\u2019s achievements in a yearlong campaign , encouraging space fans to write Lovell notes to let him know what kind of impact his space travels had on them.\nEDITORIAL\nLovell\u2019s name is synonymous with Apollo 13, but we\u2019ll never forget his Apollo 8 mission in 1968. It was the first manned flight to break from the Earth\u2019s orbit and travel around the moon.\nRELATED: Lovell spoke to Sun-Times reporter Robert Herguth about his faith in a podcast last year.\nWe asked author Robert Kurson, whose book \u201cRocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man\u2019s First Journey to the Moon\u201d will be out next month, to give a few good reasons to celebrate Lovell today. Here\u2019s his excellent list:\nJim Lovell donated many of his coolest space-related memorabilia and artifacts to the Adler Planetarium, giving Chicagoans and other visitors an intimate glimpse into the early years of space travel and exploration. He is a wonderful explainer and storyteller who often makes himself available to media and others who are interested in NASA, space, the Moon, and the future of space travel. He is a devoted husband, father and family man who has been married to the same woman, Marilyn, for 65 years. (Astronaut life was notoriously hard on marriages. In fact, the crew of Apollo 8 \u2014 Frank Borman, Lovell, and Bill Anders \u2014 is the only crew from either the Gemini or Apollo programs whose marriages all survived intact.) He is not just one of the nicest astronauts you\u2019ll meet, he\u2019s one of the nicest people you\u2019ll meet, a reputation that goes back to his earliest days with NASA. Unlike some astronauts, he dreamed as a kid of flying on rockets into space and exploring the cosmos, and he seems to have lost little of that boyhood wonder for exploration to this day. He had a golden retriever that liked to watch the Apollo 13 movie when it played on television at his home. Happy Birthday, Commander James Lovell.

Their son, U.S. Navy Radio Technician 2nd Class Clarence Donnor was missing in action, it said. \nAlthough they did not know it at the time, Donnor had been listed as aboard on the USS Indianapolis, which had been sunk by a Japanese submarine in the Philippine Sea on July 30, resulting in the largest loss of life at sea in U.S. Navy history. \nIndianapolis sank in less than 15 minutes, with some 300 sailors and Marines going down with the ship. With few lifeboats, many of the remaining faced death by exposure or shark attack until being rescued days later. \nDonnor, however, was nowhere near the disaster playing out in the Pacific. His assignment to the Indianapolis had been canceled moments before the ship deployed on a secret mission to deliver atomic bomb components to the island of Tinian, the airstrip used to launch the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead, he had received orders to report for officer training at Fort Schuyler, N.Y. \nUSS Indianapolis preparing to leave Tinian after delivering atomic bomb components, circa 26 July 1945.

He's my No. 4 QB in the draft, and he has a chance to be the best NFL player of this year's QB class.\nHere are my takeaways from Allen's pro-day workout.\n1) I can't remember a time when a quarterback prospect has done a better job in the offseason. Allen had a great performance in January at the Reese's Senior Bowl . He was the talk of the NFL Scouting Combine earlier this month with the athletic ability and arm strength he showed off in Indianapolis. On Friday, he had one of the better pro-day throwing sessions we'll see. He won the offseason.\n2) Allen's footwork, accuracy and touch were improved at the pro day from what we saw him from him a few weeks ago at the combine. It was clear that he and his QB coach, Jordan Palmer, wanted to focus on touch throws in this workout, and he showed well in that area. Of course, he also showed off his cannon of a right arm. He threw fastballs with ease.\n3) Allen still needs to work on anticipation. That's going to be a challenge for him because he has such a strong arm and will lock onto his first read at times, but I think he can do it if given time to develop before he's thrust into action in the NFL. That's why landing with a team that has an established starter would be the ideal scenario for him.\n4) I'm expecting four QBs to go in the top six picks next month, and I expect Allen to be in that group. Now, where he goes is still a question, but he reminded everyone on Friday of just how special he can be. He has rare arm talent, but he doesn't quite have the same touch and precision that guys like Darnold and Baker Mayfield possess. Allen has the most upside of any QB in this draft, but he also has a lower floor than some of his fellow signal-callers.\n5) One executive who's been making the rounds to the QB workouts this draft season texted me this message on Friday: \"These (pro days) are all the same to me. Let the tape and intangibles make your decision.\"\nAt the end of the day, teams have to go back to the tape and decide if they're comfortable with what they see from the QB. There's no doubt he had some rough outings against Power Five competition during his college career, but there's also no denying his upside. I see Allen making progress. He's trending up, but he's going to need time to fully realize his potential. He needs a franchise that will be patient with him. The payoff could be huge.\nFollow Daniel Jeremiah on Twitter @MoveTheSticks .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=/4595/nfl.news/story&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&cust_params=slot%3Dvideo%26url%3Dstory%26prtnr%3Dcollege-football%26s1%3Dstory&url=", "http://twitter.com/MoveTheSticks"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam darnold", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josh allen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darnold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laramie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:17:37.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06e15db63d583a72d286ba58272f8ed70039916e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGYfMwpuwsPo6yuXfYx7xPlth85QVHB1c_AAMUbq6zbbunXJRDrsiWbosMRHOXjY4OV70umkVw38egfpXw9q2alep3ks4NC4q4qbdd1FJsTHdLqVVhmIapehg--", "site_full": "www.indystar.com", "site": "indystar.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/indystar/todaystopstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "title_full": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "published": "2018-03-22T13:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a091bb54482b8466cb4ca5f5747706f6302849c/c=0-214-4200-2587&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/03/21/INGroup/Indianapolis/636572431296236718-MP179204-2.jpg", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 12374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 869, "comments": 2, "shares": 869}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06e15db63d583a72d286ba58272f8ed70039916e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTICyOQGDOpujlfrRZLrpGYfMwpuwsPo6yuXfYx7xPlth85QVHB1c_AAMUbq6zbbunXJRDrsiWbosMRHOXjY4OV70umkVw38egfpXw9q2alep3ks4NC4q4qbdd1FJsTHdLqVVhmIapehg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IndyStar", "published": "2018-03-22T13:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Indianapolis weather: 3-6 inches of snow could fall this weekend", "text": "Activate your digital access.

Sunshine returned Wednesday in Indianapolis, and much of the snow began to melt away. But snow quickly returned to the forecast, and a new set of weather advisories suggest that snow shovels should be kept handy this weekend. Early Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a special weather message saying snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches, with localized amounts up to 8 inches, and ice accumulations of a light glaze are possible from late Friday through Saturday evening. If the forecast comes to fruition, the heavy snowfall could have an impact on planned weekend events like the IHSAA basketball state finals , and the March For Our Lives rally. \u2014 NWS Indianapolis (@NWSIndianapolis) March 22, 2018 Cities targeted in the weather warning include Indianapolis, Shelbyville, Lafayette, Kokomo, Frankfort, Muncie, Crawfordsville and Anderson. Those communities have been placed under a winter storm watch until 2 a.m. Saturday. \"A winter storm Watch means there is potential for significant snow, sleet or ice accumulations that may impact travel,\" said a NWS statement. Previously, One national weather forecaster on Wednesday estimated 8 to 12 inches for Central Indiana over the weekend. Meteorologist Tara Dudzik with the National Weather Service said there will be precipitation, but she is not expecting a foot of snow. Chances of rain arrive Friday evening, mixing with snow after 1 a.m., according to the NWS . Snow showers are expected to pick up after 4 a.m., but precipitation amounts are expected to stay between a quarter and a half inch. Snow, rain and freezing rain will continue fall Saturday, with most coming before 3 p.m. as the high temperature approaches 36 degrees. When it comes to forecasting final snowfall totals this far out, Dudzik said, it's simply too early to tell. As a storm moves through the Central Plains and into the Midwest, anything could happen. \"Even a shift of 50 miles in the track is going to be a big difference in the type of weather,\" she said Wednbesday. With several days before the system is expected to pass through Central Indiana, Dudzik said the southern half of the state is likely to see rain, but that is likely to transition to snow stretching from Lafayette to Indianapolis and beyond. \"Anywhere north of that line right now looks like more of a snow event,\" she said. Although Saturday's high is expected to reach the high 30s, there is the potential for the snow to accumulate on the roads, especially to the northeast. \"If it drops with the snow, it could cool rather quickly,\" she said. High temperatures are expected to be in the upper 40s through the end of the week, with sunshine in the forecast Thursday and Friday, according to the NWS. Rain could return to the forecast as soon as Monday evening, with a 50 percent chance of rain possible. Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156. Follow her on Twitter: @hollyvhays .

Organizers said the Statehouse can hold up to 6,000 people and they hope to pack the building Saturday. One of the youngest students helping to plan the event is 15-year-old Isabella Fallahi, a freshman at Carmel High School. She will be one of the speakers at Saturday\u2019s event. Having a dialogue: What happens when a black teen and a white police chief talk about police brutality? Students will ask legislators to pass policies aimed at preventing school shootings. For Fallahi, the national movement may have started in Parkland, Fla., but it hit home when threats targeted Carmel High School. Although authorities eventually found no real threat to students, she remembers how scared her classmates were. \u201cThis girl starts breaking down crying, she\u2019s like \u2018Please close the door.

Darrin Kirkland Jr. (Photo: Wes Rucker, 247Sports) \"He might even finish up and get to go the last couple of practices of spring.\" A former four-star recruit out of Indianapolis, Kirkland burst onto the scene as a freshman in 2015 and became Tennessee's starting middle linebacker early in the season. He wound up finishing with the fourth-most tackles by a freshman in program history and earned SEC All-Freshman team honors. Since then, though, his career has been marred by injuries. Kirkland tore multiple ligaments in his ankle in the second game of the 2016 season, and though he returned after missing just five games, he wasn't 100 percent healthy and struggled to close the regular season before a strong showing in the Music City Bowl. He was set to man the middle of Tennessee's defense last season before going down less than two weeks before the season opener. The Vols were hoping to have him back by the spring, but their wait will go on just a little longer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pruitt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darrin kirkland jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wes rucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darrin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy pruitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new vols", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indianapolis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:57:55.015+03:00"}], "totalResults": 897, "moreResultsAvailable": 887, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745630026&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AUS+location%3AIndianapolis&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 938, "extra": {"place": "Indianapolis", "country": "US", "lat": "39.768403", "lng": "-86.158068"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "10c2be8d221af245421f5e24f0e5766f25c3e60b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.PAahAHEZfX3op2GtZ8Ka4NfsQmEdVfXqorn9wPuBzqGTXjXzgrlNdf7Dw7_HBNZ2s.p.bvMjwl2.0P6nW8MAYYdPvpyiYLgo0oulM2NIz0Ru1iU4HiZL0TBXtSMQ9dms-", "site_full": "www.hurriyetdailynews.com", "site": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com//rss.aspx", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "H\u00fcrriyet Daily News", "title": "Eurasion Economic Summit to discuss technology vs politics", "title_full": "Eurasion Economic Summit to discuss technology vs politics", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 24499, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10c2be8d221af245421f5e24f0e5766f25c3e60b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.PAahAHEZfX3op2GtZ8Ka4NfsQmEdVfXqorn9wPuBzqGTXjXzgrlNdf7Dw7_HBNZ2s.p.bvMjwl2.0P6nW8MAYYdPvpyiYLgo0oulM2NIz0Ru1iU4HiZL0TBXtSMQ9dms-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eurasion Economic Summit to discuss technology vs politics", "text": "Eurasian Economic Summit to discuss technology vs politics ISTANBUL The Marmara Group Foundation will hold the 21st Eurasian Economic Summit with its partners on April 11-12 to discuss the relationship between technology and politics, bringing together current and former statesmen, business people, opinion leaders, NGOs and religious representatives from all over the world. \n\u201cAs a modest non-governmental organization, we will carry out the Eurasian Economic Summit, which is regarded as an internationally accepted event that has been continuously held for 33 years,\u201d Marmara Group Foundation president Akkan Suver said at an Istanbul press conference on March 21.\n\u201cUnder this years\u2019 main topic \u2018The dilemma of our century: Technology vs. politics,\u2019 we will open up discussions with statesmen, business people, academics, clergymen and young people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis dilemma is a common concern for all of us in terms of peace, stability, economy and future.

However, the term is usually used for the terrorists who were killed in the operations. \nSpeaking at an event in Istanbul's Ba\u011fc\u0131lar district, Erdo\u011fan said that he discussed the ongoing counter-terror operation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. \nThe president underlined that Turkey will continue to protect the victims of the Syrian war, adding that it would not take a step back in its anti-terror operations. \n\"The work won't stop in Afrin, there is also Idlib, Manbij,\" Erdo\u011fan said, signaling the continuation of Operation Olive Branch. \nOperation Olive Branch was launched by Turkey on Jan. 20 to remove the PKK/PYD/YPG/KCK and Daesh terrorists from Afrin in northwestern Syria. The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) entered Afrin town center and liberated it from terrorists on March 18. \nAccording to the Turkish General Staff, the operation aims to establish security and stability along Turkish borders and in the region as well as to protect Syrian people from the oppression and cruelty of terrorists. \nThe operation is being carried out under the framework of Turkey's rights within international law, U.N. Security Council resolutions, its right to self-defense under the U.N. charter and respect for Syria's territorial integrity, it said. \nThe military also said, \"utmost importance\" is being placed on not harming any civilians. \nThe operation in Afrin \u2013 bordering Turkey's Hatay and Kilis provinces \u2013 was widely expected in the wake of Turkey's Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria, which cleared Daesh terrorists from Turkey's border between Aug. 24, 2016, and March 2017. \nOn March 18, Turkish-backed troops liberated the town center of Afrin, which had been a major hideout for the YPG/PKK since 2012 when the Assad regime in Syria left the city to the terror group without putting up a fight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Erdo\u011fan ISTANBUL President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said he told both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that \u201cTurkey will not step back in Syria,\u201d vowing that the ongoing campaign in Afrin will be expanded to other parts of the war-torn country, including Manbij.\n\u201cLast night I spoke with U.S. President Trump on these issues. I discussed the same things with Putin two days ago. I told them: \u2018We won\u2019t take steps backward from here. We are on the side of the suffering and the oppressed,\u2019\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in an address at a meeting of his Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Istanbul on March 23.\nErdo\u011fan and Trump spoke on the phone late on March 22 about strained ties between Ankara and Washington, particularly troubled due to the U.S.\u2019s ongoing partnership with the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG to be the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) and therefore as a terrorist organization.\nThe Turkish military, along with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), launched \u201cOperation Olive Branch\u201d against the YPG in Afrin on Jan. 20, and Erdo\u011fan vowed that operations \u201cwill not end in Afrin. Next are Idlib and Manbij.\u201d\nManbij, a northwestern Syrian town, is particularly important as it is still under the control of the YPG alongside U.S. troops. Turkey has long been urging the U.S. to let the YPG pull back from Manbij to the east of Euphrates amid threats that it will not hesitate to launch an attack on YPG positions even if American troops are present.\nNo withdrawal from Manbij: US\nHowever, a senior U.S. official said the U.S. \u201chas no intention to leave Manbij,\u201d despite Turkey\u2019s words.\n\u201cU.S. forces are located in Manbij. We have made it very clear with the Turkish government that we will continue to operate there,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a press conference in response to a question about the U.S.\u2019s stance on Manbij.\nNauert also said talks with Ankara \u201chave not been concluded\u201d and Washington is willing to continue conversations, referring to the three \u201ctechnical committees\u201d formed by Turkey and the U.S. to solve contentious issues between the two countries.\nTurkish and American delegations met in Washington on March 8 and 9 to find a way to resolve the Manbij problem but the dismissal of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has caused uncertainty about how the two countries will proceed. Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n is expected to travel to the U.S. to meet his counterpart John Sullivan next week.\n\u2018More than 3,700 terrorists neutralized\u2019\nMeanwhile, Erdo\u011fan stated that Turkey\u2019s operations against the PKK and YPG are ongoing in various parts of Syria and Iraq and the number of \u201cneutralized terrorists\u201d in Syria since Jan. 20 exceeds 3,700.\n\u201cWe will continue.

Speaking at an event in Istanbul's Ba\u011fc\u0131lar district, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Friday that he discussed the ongoing counterterrorism operation against the YPG with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. \nHe said that Turkey will not step back in its counterterrorism operations and will continue to protect the victims of the Syrian war. \"The work won't stop in Afrin, there is also Idlib, Manbij,\" Erdo\u011fan said, signaling the continuation of Operation Olive Branch against the YPG, while also reiterating Turkey's determined stance to eliminate PKK threats to its national security. The northern Syrian city of Manbij has been one of the most hotly debated points of contention between Ankara and Washington. In Idlib, however, the Turkish military established observation points last October to monitor the cease-fire in the de-escalation zones. \nAccording to the Astana agreement, reached between Turkey, Russia and Iran last year, Turkey is projected to gradually establish 12 observation points, from Idlib's north to south. \nAnkara's demand from the U.S. to cease arming the YPG and ensure its withdrawal to east of the Euphrates dates back to former President Barack Obama's time in office. The U.S. had promised to meet Ankara's demands, but has not so far, which has strained relations between the two countries. \nAs part of recent rapprochement between the two NATO allies, Ankara looks to establish an agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of the YPG from Manbij and the future administration of the city. \nForeign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said earlier this month that there has been a mutual understanding on the need for a road map, but no deal has been finalized yet with the U.S.. \nAccording to Turkish officials, Turkish and U.S. troops would ensure security in Manbij once the YPG withdraws and the two countries would monitor the withdrawal process. \nAnkara has been arguing that the future administration of Manbij should reflect the demographics of the province, determined according to a census before the civil war broke out and the YPG took control, which was predominantly Arab. \n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said the same model will be applied to other regions afterwards, including in those east of the Euphrates River and Raqqa. \nA U.S. State Department spokesperson on Thursday said that the U.S. has no intention to leave Manbij.\"U.S. forces are located in Manbij. We have made it very clear with the Turkish government that we continue to operate there,\" Heather Nauert said in a press conference in response to a question about the U.S. position on Manbij. \nMeanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said on Friday that Turkey reached an understanding with the U.S. during the meetings on March 8-9 and an undersecretary might visit Washington to try \nto find common ground on Manbij. Speaking at a press conference in Ankara, Aksoy reiterated that Turkey expects solid steps from the U.S. and that Foreign Ministry Undersecretary \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n might visit Washington next week for talks on Manbij. \nTurkey believes that U.S. President Trump also wants to improve bilateral ties, but that his efforts are undermined by holdovers from the previous administration and establishment officials. \n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Ankara is aware of Trump's eagerness to normalize relations, but added that \"he should be handling the system fully\" to do so. \nErdo\u011fan and Trump discussed bilateral and regional issues over the phone, Presidential Spokesman \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n said Thursday. \nThe conversation marks the third time the two presidents have spoken since November 2017, and it was two months since their last call. \n\"President Donald J. Trump spoke today with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to reaffirm the importance of strong relations between the United States and Turkey, as NATO allies and strategic partners, and to exchange views on regional developments,\" a statement from the White House said. \nTouching on the possible implications of the ouster of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on ties, Aksoy said that continuity and maintaining dialogue is fundamental. \nTrump said Thursday that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton will replace McMaster as national security adviser next month. \nAfter former State of Secretary Rex Tillerson's visit in February, Ankara and Washington agreed to establish joint working groups to overcome their differences, particularly the U.S.' support for the YPG in Syria, the G\u00fclenist Terror Group (FET\u00d6) and Iraq. \nThe decision on Manbij was discussed on March 8-9 between the working groups from both countries in Washington.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdo\u011fan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pkk-affiliated people's protection units", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afrin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manbij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euphrates river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ba\u011fc\u0131lar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:57:20.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f28319992d5ad7fe9c95e27b0cd69246a0194b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tz5sLjv.6M30X0iKG7yjilNM_hdkIW31ee9S6rwALQTIOp0n8mz5v4OOCyWoH.UGa6ZPjQ2xbF011ACXg5dpJVSjmpNoH3jFeq1rxN4EBpng--", "site_full": "aa.com.tr", "site": "aa.com.tr", "site_section": "http://www.aa.com.tr/rss/ajansgunceleng.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131 G\u00fcncel Haberler", "title": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "title_full": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "published": "2018-03-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2018/03/24/thumbs_b_c_defa2ed4ea8c6efabead33bce5f372f6.jpg?v=102305", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f28319992d5ad7fe9c95e27b0cd69246a0194b08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tz5sLjv.6M30X0iKG7yjilNM_hdkIW31ee9S6rwALQTIOp0n8mz5v4OOCyWoH.UGa6ZPjQ2xbF011ACXg5dpJVSjmpNoH3jFeq1rxN4EBpng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019", "text": "\u2018Argentina, Turkey look for better relations\u2019 \n\u201cThis visit will bring new business [opportunities] to both countries,\u201d says Argentinian official Ariel Cohen Sabban, President of Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association (DAIA) \nBy Nilay Kar Onum \nISTANBUL \nThe current relations between Turkey and Argentina are expected to further improve in the coming days, the head of the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association said. \nSpeaking to Anadolu Agency in Istanbul, Ariel Cohen Sabban, President of the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Association (DAIA) said: \u201cWe think that the relations between Turkey and Argentina will grow from day to day.\u201d \nSabban arrived in Istanbul on Friday with an 18-person Argentinian media delegation invited by Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry together with the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEIK) for a three-day visit. \n\u201cWe are sure that this visit to Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey will bring new business [opportunities] to both countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will also bring better relations between Argentina and Turkey.\u201d \nHe stated that Turkey and Argentina were \"on the same page\" in terms of improving their ties: \u201cBoth countries want to improve and want to restart a different vision in the world.\u201d \nIn January 2017, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had paid a visit to Argentina\u2019s capital of Buenos Aires.

The Prime Minister told\nhim that today Iran threatens not only the Middle East but the entire world\nand added that Iran had to be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. The\ntwo men discussed advancing bilateral cooperation in technology, innovation\nand trade.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu thanked Bulgarian President Radev for Holocaust\ncommemoration in Bulgaria and said that he appreciated the latter's position\nin the struggle against anti-Semitism.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu:\n\"Mr. President, you have always been a staunch ally of the Jewish state and\nthe Jewish people. You've spoken eloquently and powerfully against\nanti-Semitism and you are welcome as a true friend, as is Bulgaria. We have\na special relationship with Bulgaria \u2013 past, present and future.\nWe'll never forget that 75 years ago, the people of Bulgaria in Sofia stood\nup in an exemplary way against the Nazi demands for deportation: The\nclerics, the teachers, the intellectuals who came to the train station in\nSofia. And I was always impressed by the telegram of the German\nrepresentative to Berlin who said, explaining the failure of this\ndeportation. He said: \"The people of Bulgaria haven't developed enough.\" And\nin fact, it showed the moral heights that Bulgaria reached in those days.\nAnd we know that there were dark periods in those horrible years. But we\nalways remember what happened in Sofia as a testament of human morality and\nfriendship to our people.\nToday we have excellent relations and they are buttressed by Bulgarian Jews\nwho came here, who form an integral human bridge between us. And equally, we\nhave flourishing relations, which we work in many ways to cement and develop\nin this visit of yours in a variety of fields, all fields really.\nAnd that leads me to the future. You were yesterday in Beer-Sheva, you saw\nour cyber center. Israel is seizing the future, not only in matters of cyber\nsecurity but in all matters of technology that will change our lives. I'm\nstill under the impression of a breakfast I had on Sunday with a visionary,\nElon Musk, who speaks about changing the world. He speaks about reaching\nMars, speaks about plumbing the depths of the earth and the human mind, and\nthese are not fantasies \u2013 these are things that are happening. Israel is at\nthe forefront of all this scientific research and technological know-how.\nWe're eager to share it with our friends. You are our friends, we share with\nyou the past, a vibrant present and unbelievable future.\nWelcome to Jerusalem friend.\"\nBulgarian President Radev:\n\"Thank you for the warm words that you have said about Bulgarian people.\nI want to congratulate you with the 70th birthday of Israel, which is now\nnothing but an example for a modern state with functional institutions,\nvibrant democracy and vibrant civil society. We are together in\ncommemorating the 75th anniversary on an unprecedented act of the rescue of\nBulgarian Jewish population, which is nothing but a solid foundation to\nbuild upon our ties. This historically connected ties between our two\npeoples \u2013 this is nothing but a priceless capital, which we should care and\ndevelop.\nBut today what we need is more pragmatism in our bilateral relations. I'm\nsure that you agree with me that what we have as a trade exchange in amount\nof 150 million dollars does not correspond either with our good political\nties or either with the atmosphere between the two countries.\nWe are deeply interested to take the Israeli example to build a society that\nis both socially engaged and integrated. I mean basically the hi-tech, I\nmean the cyber security, and science and education.\nThank you very much that you opened before our delegation the gates of the\nGav Yam technological park to look at the future. We saw with our own eyes\non the spot the tremendous advantage of Israel in this area. It came to my\nmind that you are the founding father of this initiative and I congratulate\nyou.\nWe are also quite interested in diversification of resources. And another\ngood opportunity is to both import and pass natural gas through Bulgaria.\nWe have good cooperation in the field of fight against terror. I would like\nto stress the important support we received from you after the terror act in\nSarafovo in 2012. The tense situation in this world requires the security\ncommunities to cooperate with each other. And also our well-established ties\nin the sphere of defense.\nMy visit to Israel is also connected with participation in the 6th Global\nForum to Combat Anti-Semitism, and this is in a world that the voice of\nhatred and xenophobia is rising up. I would like to confirm the firm\nposition of Bulgaria of zero tolerance toward revisionism of history, and\nhatred and anti-Semitism.\nPrime Minister, as I said, we have a lot of pragmatic issues ahead of us,\nand I will be very glad if we discuss them and seek steps forward for us.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rumen radev", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T23:24:23.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e1ca349e7764e29d17bed03a7dedec168cf58c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lRYtVMq_QpDUs.FnF6MLVIa4duGbbMzyjwhBQB0biETXRffj6RAc2_ZOoqp9gFyY-", "site_full": "www.israelnationalnews.com", "site": "israelnationalnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "judaism", "religion"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "title_full": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "published": "2018-03-25T18:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.058, "main_image": "http://k6s3v6r4.ssl.hwcdn.net/pictures/794/794766.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18367, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e1ca349e7764e29d17bed03a7dedec168cf58c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.lRYtVMq_QpDUs.FnF6MLVIa4duGbbMzyjwhBQB0biETXRffj6RAc2_ZOoqp9gFyY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T18:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barka won't seek reelection - Israel National News", "text": "  Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat won't seek reelection Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat won't seek reelection \nNir Barkat says he will run for Knesset seat with Likud rather than seek third term as mayor of Israel's capital.

Security forces should be formed to ensure the stability of the region,\u201d he suggested. Emphasizing on timely parliamentary elections, he urged inclusion of political parties in the election process. \u201cThe government should provide the budget of the elections, if outsiders pay the cost of the elections, they will have preconditions and interference in the process,\u201d Hekmatyar said.

Saha helped Bagan chase down a target of 152 in seven overs against Bengal Nagpur Railways (BNR) in a JC Mukherjee Trophy game. Saha\u2019s innings was punctuated by 14 sixes and four boundaries apart from two singles. He finished off the innings by hitting six sixes in an over off medium pacer Aman Prosad for six sixes. It also included a wide delivery, which means a total of 37 runs were scored. \n\u201cI could feel from the first ball that I was able to hit the ball in the middle and I went for it,\u201d Saha is quoted as saying by PTI. \u201cNot sure of this being a record, but looking into the IPL, I tried to play different shots and it worked.\u201d \nThe fastest T20 century overall was scored by Chris Gayle for the Royal Challengers Bangalore and it came off 30 balls. It is also the fasters century in any format of the game. Saha\u2019s century, though faster, was not scored in an official tournament and hence won\u2019t be considered. \nSaha has dound himself becoming Test specialist over the years. He is India\u2019s primary wicketkeeper in Tests since MS Dhoni\u2019s retirement in 2014, although Parthiv Patel was preferred over him for much of the recent tour of South Africa. But Saha has shown his ability in the T20 format and even scored a century in the 2014 edition playing for Kings XI Punjab. He was bought for Rs 5 crore by SRH in the auctions preceding the upcoming 11th edition of the IPL.

And, it isn\u2019t even done on the sly. At Murgi Patty on Fenwick Bazar Street behind New Market , these birds are openly sold and bought under the shadow of the clock tower. An overwhelming majority of customers are owners of roll, biryani and momo stalls that do brisk business on the city\u2019s streets, serving fares at unbelievable prices. Not just this spot, there are at least two other locations in New Market \u2014 one on Market Street and the other in the market\u2019s fish range \u2014 where sellers and buyers break into frenetic activity with lifeless and listless chicken when the rest of the city is asleep. This 45-60 minutes of business \u2014 whose turnover would run into crores a month \u2014 is so well-entrenched that civic officials and police officers deliberately look the other way. Shortly after 4.30am, the first of many trucks carrying chicken for the wholesale market arrives in the locality. Over the next hour, 20-25 trucks roll into the market, each carrying 1,500-2,000 \u2018live\u2019 chicken. But many among them are dead. They either die of temperature variation during the long hours of travel; or get suffocated in cramped cages used to transport them. Some also suffer from coccidiosis or chronic respiratory disease. The chicken are sorted out after unloading with dead and sick ones lined up on the road. Soon, the blacktop disappears as hundreds of motionless chicken pave the street and buyers converge from all over and strike deals for the dead meat. They all converse with a well-built man in the mid-30s. TOI reporters, too, approached him, posing as caterers looking for cheap meat. \u201cIt will cost you Rs 70 a kg,\u201d the man said, waving his arm at the insipid chicken. Live chicken sells for Rs 100 a kg in the market. He had a tip too. The dead and extremely sick chicken needed to be dressed immediately as transporting them could be risky given the sudden vigil on such birds following the chief minister\u2019s warning on Wednesday. All around, cash exchanged hands and the motionless birds were carted away in cycle vans. One of the buyers said he worked in a mid-rung hotel. \u201cMost of the chicken are picked up by small hotels and roadside eateries,\u201d he said. A few paces away where Fenwick Bazar Street met Market Street, a crowd had gathered before a shop where sick chicken were being dressed and sold. A couple of lay dead. Here, too, the rate was Rs 70 a kg for sick chicken. Abdul Latif, another chicken retailer in the area, said he sold them at Rs 65 a kg to regular customers. \u201cThere is no harm in consuming these chicken. They have either just died on the way or will expire soon,\u201d he reasoned. One of the buyers who has a biryani stall said he had been serving these chicken for over a year without any complaints from his customers. \u201cI sell chicken biryani for Rs 65 a plate. That includes a breast or leg piece. If I were to buy live chicken that sells for Rs 100 a kg, I would not have been able to do business,\u201d he said. Another few paces down Market Street and one lands at the fish range inside New Market. Here, too, ailing and dead chicken are sold. But the sellers here have become wary of strangers since last week. \u201cI don\u2019t sell cheap chicken to strangers,\u201d one of the traders said.

This season there will be added pressure on him,\u201d Chawla, who is also Kuldeep\u2019s Uttar Pradesh teammate in domestic cricket, said. \nKuldeep has an ability to soak pressure, something that has reflected in his bowling for India and Chawla feels the chinaman will do well. \n\u201cWhen he came into the scene for the first time, he was quite raw and there was not much of expectations from him. But this season, when he enters the field there will be a lot of expectations. He will definitely do well with the kind of bowler he is,\u201d Chawla said on the sidelines of a KKR promotional programme. \nKKR\u2019s \u2018mystery spinner\u2019 Sunil Narine was once again reported for suspect action during the Pakistan Super League but Chawla backed the West Indian to do well for KKR. \n\u201cThe best thing is the way he comes back after that (reported for suspect action). The effectiveness is the same. It\u2019s just that the team has started playing him a bit on the safer side. When they play you on the safer side, it becomes a bit tough for the bowlers to pick up wickets. \n\u201cBut at the same time, it is an opportunity for us to take wickets as batsmen take chances against us. So me or Kuldeep, we get chance to pick up wickets. My role will always stay the same \u2014 to take wickets. When I joined KKR, Sunil was taking wickets and our combination worked really well.\u201d \nChawla said the team was looking forward to playing under the new captain Dinesh Karthik . \n\u201cI have not that played much under him. He is one of the experienced campaigners and who has done really well. The way he\u2019s playing right now, the confidence will definitely help him to lead the side well,\u201d Chawla said referring to the Karthik\u2019s last-ball six against Bangladesh in the Tri-nation T20 final in Sri Lanka. \nKKR also have roped in three U-19 World Cup winning cricketers in Shubman Gill, Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. \n\u201cWe all have seen their performances while winning the U-19 World Cup. All of them are top level cricketers. Shubman Gill is one amazing talent, and one to look out for. He looks different, the confidence when he walks in is different,\u201d Chawla said, showering praise on Gill. \nThe programme was also attended by Ishank Jaggi who helped KKR enter the Qualifier 2 by stitching a 36-run stand with then skipper Gautam Gambhir in a rain-affected game in Bengaluru last season.

The fast bowler\u2019s contract had been held back pending investigation into the possibility that he had received money from a man through a woman based in Pakistan. \nWhile the Kolkata Police is probing the criminal charges against Shami, including Section 307 (attempt to murder), based on a complaint filed by his wife Hasin Jahan, the BCCI restricted its inquiry solely to breaching the anti-corruption code for the players. \nThe Committee of Administrators (CoA) had asked the ACU chief Neeraj Kumar to look into whether Shami had taken any money from a certain England-based Mohammed bhai, sent to him through a Pakistani woman, Alishba, in Dubai. \nOn Thursday, the BCCI release said: \u201cThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India appointed Committee of Administrators had requested Mr Neeraj Kumar, former Police Commissioner of Delhi and Head of BCCI Anti-Corruption Unit, to investigate the allegations against Mohd. Shami insofar as they pertain to the provisions of the BCCI Anti-Corruption Code. \n\u201cMr Neeraj Kumar has submitted his confidential report to the CoA. Based on the conclusions in the said report, the CoA is of the view that no further actions/proceedings under the BCCI anti-corruption code are warranted in the matter. \n\u201cFor this reason, the BCCI shall proceed with offering a Grade \u2018B\u2019 annual retainership contract to Mohd. Shami.\u201d \nThe speedster now joins KL Rahul, Umesh Yadav , Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Hardik Pandya, Ishant Sharma and Dinesh Karthik in Grade B on Rs 3 crore per annum. And the BCCI clean chit also clears the decks for him to resume his association with his IPL franchise, Delhi Daredevils. The franchise had been waiting for the cricket board directive in this regard. \nAfter the BCCI verdict, Shami re-tweeted a DD post that said: \u201cWe\u2019re glad to hear the verdict! @MdShami11 has been cleared to play by the @BCCI.\u201d Talking to The Indian Express, Daredevils CEO Hemant Dua, too, welcomed the decision. \u201cWe are excited. You know it\u2019s for the (game of) cricket, not just for DD but more for cricket. He is a great bowler and he gets to go. We never had any doubts about that (on Shami). He is welcomed to join the DD camp, from March 27-28 (at Feroz Shah Kotla), when we start. We are very happy for him,\u201d Dua told this paper. \nMUST READ | Mohammed Shami-Hasin Jahan: How the sordid saga unfolded \nThe Daredevils exercised the Right-to-Match card option at the IPL 2018 auction to retain Shami for Rs 3 crore. \nLast week the Committee of Administrators chief Vinod Rai had told The Indian Express: \u201cAs per the recorded phone conversation, he (Shami) talks about taking money from some extraneous sources, from one Mohammed bhai. Now, the handbook for players specifically says that if they receive money from some extraneous sources, they are required to inform the BCCI. So we are asking him, what\u2019s the money for? The ACU will look into this. Rest we will follow the police inquiry.\u201d \nOff the field, however, a legal battle awaits the cricketer, as the Kolkata Police has booked Shami and his family members under non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code. Shami\u2019s mother Anjuman-Ara-Begum, brother Hasib Ahmed, Hasib\u2019s wife Shama and Shabina Ahjum, Shami\u2019s sister are among those who have been named in the FIR. The FIR has been lodged under section 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder), 376(rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. \nHasin, meanwhile, reportedly has sought an audience with the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as she said she wanted to have the chief minister\u2019s support in her \u201cfight\u201d against Shami. She has also recorded a confidential statement before a judicial magistrate.

Choudhary, in an email to BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, and copied to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) and other BCCI officials have also mentioned another article that described Gupta\u2019s take on the actress as \u201cSlut-shaming Deepika Padukone.\u201d \nQuestioning the BCCI\u2019s selection process that also involved recruitment firm Korn Ferry, Choudhary wrote: \u201cA simple search on the internet, revealed the following stories mentioning the candidate selected for the post we are presently concerned with, regarding an article that the person authored, the content of which is for everyone to see.\u201d \nThe two articles refer to the controversy that had started after The Times of India had tweeted a Deepika Padukone video with the caption: \u201cOMG! Deepika Padukone\u2019s cleavage show\u201d. To this, Deepika had responded with: \u201cYES! I am a Woman. I have breasts AND a cleavage! You got a problem!!??\u201d. \nGupta had defended The Times of India in an article with a headline \u201cDear Deepika, our point of view\u2026\u201d where she wrote: \u201cDeepika, just for the record, we do not zoom into a woman\u2019s vagina or show her nipples\u2026 What about all the times, and there have been many, when you have flaunted your body off screen \u2014 while dancing on stage, posing for magazine covers, or doing photo ops at movie promotional functions? What \u2018role\u2019 do you play there? So why the hypocrisy?\u201d \nAsked about Choudhary\u2019s objections, Gupta told The Indian Express: \u201cI really have no clue about it and I don\u2019t want to comment anything on it.\u201d \nKorn Ferry\u2019s candidate report on Priya Gupta, accessed by The Indian Express, gives the executive evolution, contact information, education, compensation package, personal and career details of the candidate. The \u201csummary\u201d segment said: \u201cShe has played a successful part in making Bollywood engaging. She is confident of doing that with BCCI and with cricket if she is allowed to give it a shot.\u201d \nGupta has been offered Rs 1.65 crore per year for the BCCI job, which she accepted. An email from Johri to the CoA on February 28 requested the \u201capproval\u201d to \u201cprocess the offer letter/contract\u201d. \nOn engaging Korn Ferry, Choudhary wrote: \u201cThe decision to do so was taken in a meeting in which I also participated\u2026 yet for reasons unknown, the decision\u2026 awaited my exit from the meeting despite the fact that (the) Acting Honorary Secretary\u2026 would sign on appointment letters.\u201d For all the latest Sports News , download Indian Express App Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deepika padukone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amitabh choudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul johri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shamik chakrabarty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "choudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "priya gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devendra pandey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bcci", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "committee of administrators", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:21:18.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "828b66e040b80e2978c9e66f7912ea240baf9930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMruVGrVjAdQ24rtrc41F7eETwunlerpuJhJM9ssL69FobUu63lAAbuja6HhIIKwh0r1sclQq6IKSsiTx4L3g660ohDnyonikjb6GJM06AgauuT0gdqBbo7aAJQXG6T3XfqrGMMbclqesofuw_U2FGMXlE1o3C2KPVTtx4xjeOQ00zKcn0P2eRALh", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/rssfeeds/13352306.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Industry-The Economic Times", "title": "led tv prices: Customs duty on open cell displays halved, LED TV prices set to go down - The Economic Times", "title_full": "led tv prices: Customs duty on open cell displays halved, LED TV prices set to go down - The Economic Times", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-63435976,width-672,resizemode-4,imgsize-58646/customs-duty-on-open-cell-displays-halved-led-tv-prices-set-to-go-down.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 180, "comments": 0, "shares": 180}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "828b66e040b80e2978c9e66f7912ea240baf9930", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMruVGrVjAdQ24rtrc41F7eETwunlerpuJhJM9ssL69FobUu63lAAbuja6HhIIKwh0r1sclQq6IKSsiTx4L3g660ohDnyonikjb6GJM06AgauuT0gdqBbo7aAJQXG6T3XfqrGMMbclqesofuw_U2FGMXlE1o3C2KPVTtx4xjeOQ00zKcn0P2eRALh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Writankar Mukherjee", "published": "2018-03-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "led tv prices: Customs duty on open cell displays halved, LED TV prices set to go down - The Economic Times", "text": "KOLKATA: The government has halved the basic custom duty on open cell displays used in the manufacturing of LED television panels whereby leading television makers like Samsung, LG, Panasonic and Sony are now likely to roll back the price increase on television sets. \n\nA notification issued by finance ministry on Friday evening said the government has reduced duties on open cell displays of 15.6-inch and above from 10% to 5%. This constitutes almost 95% of the television market. The government had imposed 10% duty on open cell panels in the last Budget as compared to nil which was earlier. \n\nThe industry was lobbying against the imposition of this duty and leading players like Samsung and Panasonic had earlier this month increased prices by up to 6% while others like Sony and LG had planned similar hikes for the new models which are rolled out in April. \n\nPanasonic India CEO Manish Sharma said the government\u2019s decision to revise the basic custom duty on open cell panels to 5% brings back the emphasis on \u2018Make in India\u2019 vision which will drive momentum and develop new capacities for television manufacturing within India. \n\n\u201cGoing forward, the consumer electronics industry can look forward to a developed manufacturing ecosystem whilst creating job opportunities,\u201d Sharma said. \n\nA senior industry executive said the companies will now try to absorb the impact of 5% taxation on open cell panels to boost demand, since television sales has not been growing since last October. \n\nSharma said with the new models now getting rolled out, the price increase, if any, will not be significant. \u201cWe will try to absorb the impact. With 5% duty, the overall impact on television manufacturing cost will be about 2.5%.

Gabriel Osu, \u201cPalm Sunday is one of the Major Feasts of our Lord, and it is the day on which the Lord Jesus Christ entered Jerusalem as a King, riding o\u00adn a donkey and a colt, the foal of a donkey. Accordingly, the crowds with palm and olive branches, who joyfully chanted \u201cHosanna, Son of David\u201d, greeted Him. On this day also, we receive and worship Christ in this same manner, acknowledging Him as our King and Lord.\u201d \nHe explained further that Palm Sunday also marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of Lent, and the week in which Christians celebrate the mystery of their salvation through Christ\u2019s Death and His Resurrection on Easter Sunday. The Holy Week starts from Sunday and will run till Good Friday, March 30, 2018. \nA major hall mark of the feast is the celebration of the Holy Mass followed by a procession of the faithful carrying palm branches, representing the Jews who celebrated Christ\u2019s entrance into Jerusalem. \nHere in the Archdiocese of Lagos, the Archbishop of Lagos, His Grace Alfred Adewale Martins is expected to lead thousands of the faithful in Palm Sunday procession through the streets of Lagos Island and environs. adekunle", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam eyoboka", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lazarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abayomi adeshida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel osu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cardinal onaiyekan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "queen of nigeria catholic church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic bishop of abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic archdiocese", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "easter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T21:46:56.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d18aece547aa2547fdf68b1b3e6ef0c1b066fe6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzoYS95y6Ply3kcWOUfMFHhckaq4Ku4tdvYChurMeNqtX7Ks9DQK6J0voH61gMyOItmuwSe540MdGXgVkWki5E6J5LzzHvX_ucoUQUSSbzG2g--", "site_full": "punchng.com", "site": "punchng.com", "site_section": "http://www.yohaig.ng/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "YOHAIG", "title": "AUGAPOL berates Buhari for kidnap, return of Dapchi schoolgirls", "title_full": "AUGAPOL berates Buhari for kidnap, return of Dapchi schoolgirls", "published": "2018-03-24T04:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn1.yohaig.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Buhari-and-the-Dapchi-girls.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2692, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 107, "comments": 0, "shares": 107}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d18aece547aa2547fdf68b1b3e6ef0c1b066fe6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzoYS95y6Ply3kcWOUfMFHhckaq4Ku4tdvYChurMeNqtX7Ks9DQK6J0voH61gMyOItmuwSe540MdGXgVkWki5E6J5LzzHvX_ucoUQUSSbzG2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abdulfatai Ayobami Ibrahim", "published": "2018-03-24T04:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "AUGAPOL berates Buhari for kidnap, return of Dapchi schoolgirls", "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, with the released Dapchi girls and their parents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Friday. NAN photo Eric Dumo A civil society group, Activists United against Graft and Anti-People\u2019s Policies, have slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for his administration\u2019s handling of the kidnap and return of 105 female pupils of Government Girls Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, by Boko Haram. Describing the development as a \u201cpoorly scripted drama\u201d by the All Progressives Congress-led federal government to score a cheap political point ahead of the 2019 general elections, AUGAPOL said that rather than celebrate, the Buhari administration should cover its face in shame for the embarrassment it had caused Nigeria in the eyes of the international community. Speaking in Lagos on Friday during a press briefing, National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Mark Adebayo, said that the entire saga highlighted clearly how the regime had lost the fight against corruption it claimed to be tackling. He said, \u201cIf you look at what has happened with the kidnap and return of the female students in Dapchi by Boko Haram without any form of resistance by security agencies, you\u2019ll know that the entire drama is a poorly scripted one to score cheap political point ahead of next year\u2019s election. \u201cEven in the movie world, any director who tries to portray such as a story worthy of viewers\u2019 time, would be regarded as a quack. \u201cThis whole episode highlights just how much corruption has continued to fester under President Muhammadu Buhari, a man who rode to power with the promise of fighting graft.\u201d Speaking further, the group called on the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, to put a stop to the practice of some state officials holding retreats with public funds outside the city, adding that any attempt to syphon tax payers\u2019 money through this means would be resisted Copyright PUNCH.

Even the large signboard that welcomes people to the estate boldly says \u2018Welcome to Riverview Estate, Isheri North \u2026For purposeful habitation\u2019. And like it says, the quiet in the estate is calming and refreshing. When Mr. Sola Olubunmi moved to LSDPC Riverview Estate, now famously known as Tinubu Estate, two years ago, he loved it immediately. He recalled being taken in by the sights and sounds as he was rewarded with the sound birds piercing the quiet of the early morning. And with monkeys being a familiar sight in the estate, Olubunmi felt the breathtaking beauty of nature first-hand. But within months of arriving in the neighbourhood, his love for the monkeys turned sour. \u201cWhen I first came here, I really loved it. It was so quiet and I loved to just look at the monkeys. They would come out from the bush behind my place and I would feed them. \u201cI felt staying close to them was added bonus. The people I met here used to tell me at the time that I would soon hate them, but I said that would never happen. Some even volunteered to get me catapult to use to dissuade them from coming to my place, but I said no. And truly, the story is different today. \u201cNow, I cannot stand them. One night, I came home and found my kitchen scattered and some food items gone. The monkeys gained access to my kitchen after tearing the window net. They ate my bread and other food items and messed up the kitchen. Then, I learnt my lesson. My love for them has turned to animosity and I can no longer stand them. It is now about \u2013 how can I get rid of them?\u201d Olubunmi said. The monkeys, including baboons and the residents of the estate are neighbours who have coexisted for over two decades. But now, the relationship is strained as the humans have grown tired of the primates\u2019 propensity to damage things and steal their food. Riverview Estate is known for its monkeys, which the residents call by different names- \u2018Thieves of Riverview\u2019, \u2018Sneaky thieves\u2019, \u2018Alibabas\u2019 and so on. It was learnt that the monkeys got to be living close to the estate because they were cut off by the expansion of human development into their natural habitat, leading to its depletion. Isheri Estates Community is a large community comprising estates and others off the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Some gated estates of million-naira mansions in the community include Riverview, Harmony and Isheri GRA. According to residents, the sections of the community inhabited by the monkeys are small bushy areas in Isheri North, behind Riverview Estate and by its entrance. Behind the estate is a land area allocated to some government officials in Lagos, but which is largely undeveloped. This is part of the little area that the monkeys still call home and even that will be taken away from them once development expands further. \u201cThe monkeys here failed to migrate before civilisation caught up with them. At the back of the Isheri North, there is a land area that didn\u2019t develop quite as fast as the others. Everyone allocated land there developed theirs except for some top government functionaries, who failed to develop theirs. So that part left undeveloped is the part inhabited by the monkeys. That was how the monkeys were cut off in that part that was still bushy, so they stayed back,\u201d Olubunmi said. In the community, stories abound about the first interactions humans had with the monkeys at the outset of the urban encroachment of the primates\u2019 habitat before the modern estates in the area were established. Some of the stories that have been told feature unconfirmed but interesting human encounters with gorillas. One of such stories as shared by one of the residents, who identified himself as Mr. Olamide and had lived in the community for 10 years, described how a group of surveyors stumbled across a troop of gorillas in the 1990s while investigating the land. \u201cWe heard that there was a set of surveyors that came here to work on the site in the 1990s and that the head of the group was very tough. This place was still a forest at the time. While the group was cutting through the forest, each time they saw snakes and some other wild animals along the way, the boss would tell them to proceed. The team was scared but he pushed them to go ahead. He sounded like he wasn\u2019t scared of anything. \u201cThen they stumbled across a troop of gorillas, who locked eyes with them and seemed to be sizing them up. We understand that the surveyors thought that their boss would give them the courage to still go ahead, but he didn\u2019t do that. He was the one who first took to his heels. We heard that he was so far ahead of his team that they didn\u2019t catch up with him until they got back to the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway,\u201d he said. Another famous story in the estate is about how a man, who used to catch monkeys in the area, was beaten black and blue by a gorilla. \u201cWhen I came here, I heard that there was a man that knew how to catch monkeys. I understand that he had a farm around here at the time and used to catch them to sell and to keep. Then there was a day the man realised that some monkeys were eating things on his farm, so he bought plenty palm wine and left it there. \u201cLater, he saw the monkeys drinking the palm wine and he was so happy that he had caught them because he knew that soon after, they would sleep off. And according to the story, soon after, they all slept off. So he started putting them in a cage. Then he saw something that looked like a man nudging the monkeys to wake up. But the monkeys were fast asleep. \u201cThen this thing, which the man later realised was a gorilla, grabbed a long sugarcane, cut it into two and started beating him. It was said that the man ran into the village here at the time with what remained of the sugarcane sticking out from his head,\u201d another resident, Michael Aboh, said. Although, there was no proof that the stories are true, the current residents identified the monkeys\u2019 favourite foods as bread, pawpaw, palm wine, banana and plantain, so there is no love lost between the two \u2013 humans and monkeys \u2013 with their diets clashing. The monkeys are fond of peeping into people\u2019s kitchens through the window and when they see food items that catch their fancy, they tear the net and squeeze through the burglarproof to steal it. \u201cThere are rules for people who live here and the major one is to keep anything that the monkeys might be interested in like bread, biscuits, plantains and soups away from your kitchen. When you are not there, don\u2019t leave anything they like lying around in your kitchen or anywhere they can catch a glimpse of it. \u201cBread is their favourite food. They have lived among humans for so long that they like to have some of our foods in their diet. They like pawpaw and palm wine too. When they see what they like through the window, they will do anything to get it. If you leave bread on your kitchen cabinet, they will tear the net to get it. Sometimes, I put my things, including pots of soup, in the passage. Some of my friends ask why I put them in the passage; they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Olubunmi said. Olubunmi recalled how his neighbour returned from a trip one day to find food items and monkey faeces strewn across the floor. \u201cAfter eating his soup and everything they could find to eat, they defecated in his kitchen. After that experience, his love for them disappeared. He was the one who used to encourage me to like them but after the incident, he started blaming me for encouraging them to come to the house. So he suggested that we lure them. \u201cSince they like palm wine, we thought we should even lure them with something more attractive than palm wine, so we bought two expensive bottles of whiskey and poured some on bread. But when the monkeys came, they took the bread, smelled it and tore off the part with the alcohol drink and ate only the dry part. \u201cThere was a day one came into my kitchen while I was at home. I had forgotten that I left bread on the cabinet. When I quickly rushed to the kitchen, it ran away. I was mad because the bread was still hot; I had just bought it from a bakery around here. And because it had touched it, I could not eat it again. \u201cSo I tried to lure it with the remaining bread so that I could trap it. I would leave a piece of bread in the kitchen and then attempt to quickly rush out to shut the window so I could trap him inside but each time, I failed. I must have tried it for about 10 times, and each time, he got out from the kitchen through the window before I could get to shut it. \u201cSince that day, that monkey stopped getting too close to me. I have noticed also that once you decide to catch them, they start staying away from you. They used to eat from my hand but since the time I decided that I would catch them; they stopped coming to take food from my hand. They would stay at a distance and wait for me to throw it. It was just like they could read minds,\u201d he said. There is a pawpaw tree in Olubunmi\u2019s compound, which he described as the one that survived after three attempts. He said the previous ones that were planted were eaten by monkeys and that the third one had survived because he practically guided it past the tender stage when it was edible for the monkeys. Now, for Olubunmi and the other residents of his compound, the challenge is getting to reach ripe pawpaw before the monkeys. \u201cThe pawpaw fruits that are on the tree now are being carefully monitored by residents of this house and the monkeys. As we are checking to see if the fruits are ripe, they are also doing the same. Recently, one evening, I saw one of them looking there. It looked at it, considered briefly if they were ripe and then left them after making up its mind that they were not. So we are both monitoring the fruits to see who gets them first. That is how it is here; we are competing with the monkeys,\u201d he added. All over the estate, there are different stories of experiences with the monkeys. Immanuel Adebayo shared the story of how a woman who had just bought a bunch of plantain and left it in the kitchen to quickly attend to her children, returned to see monkeys running away with it. \u201cIn just a few minutes, they had torn the net and helped themselves to the whole bunch. They took it all away. There were some children eating biscuits outside, some monkeys came down, took the remaining biscuits from them and started sharing them among themselves. All the kids could do was to stare at them. \u201cThere have been cases where monkeys have also stolen from little children sent to buy bread and snacks within the estate,\u201d he said. Adebayo, who helps his parents man their store, said he dared not leave the place for a minute for fear that the monkeys would eat the edible products being sold there. \u201cThe monkeys have stolen bread, sausages and biscuits here in the past but we are wiser now. I never leave this place for any reason except we lock it up,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the rivalry between residents of the estate and the monkeys has recorded some casualties, on the part of the latter. Some monkeys have been caught and killed by residents. A resident, Emmanuel Kehinde, said, \u201cRecently, the security guards at the gate caught a monkey and the older ones showed up. Initially, the guards ran away before they were able to summon courage and return to drive away the monkeys that had come to fight for their own. The monkey later died and our suspicion was that the chain put round his neck to restrain him was too tight. \u201cThere was another one that was caught in a woman\u2019s kitchen and killed by residents. It was hit with an iron bar. They can be pests; we are tired of them. They damage things, including air conditioners because of the way they hop on them when jumping from house to house.\u201d However, a conservationist and environment activist, Mr. Desmond Majekodunmi, described the killing of the monkeys and their plight as \u201cvery sad\u201d, saying it was the humans that had invaded their habitat. He said, \u201cThe solution actually starts in our minds and it is not a difficult one. We have to understand that we human beings are not apart from nature; we are a part of nature. The monkeys may kill other animals but only for the purpose of eating and survival, if they are threatened. But there is no real justification for humans to kill them. We don\u2019t have to. \u201cThe developers of the estate, knowing that they had encroached on these monkeys\u2019 home, could put barbed wire on the concrete fence there and once the monkeys know that there is barbed wire there, they won\u2019t enter the estate. But because of that small amount of money they would not want to spend, they would rather kill off the monkeys. And sadly, our zoological services are not very developed and don\u2019t have enough budget, otherwise, such could try to capture them and put them in a safe place. But ideally, the whole forest area should be protected. \u201cIt is very unlikely that the monkeys would survive (since development will still get to where they are now); we don\u2019t have zoos that can take them and we don\u2019t have the right attitude that we need to protect them, and not only the monkeys, but the habitat as well. There should be small pockets of forests called urban forests that should be preserved. An example of such an urban forest is LUFASI \u2013 Lekki Urban Forest and Animal Sanctuary Initiative. \u201cDevelopment is not just concrete and asphalt. Development is working in harmony with nature, knowing that we are a part of nature. It is very sad that there is very little that can be done since the whole area will still be encroached upon.\u201d Majekodunmi, however, promised to discuss the matter with a conservation group to see if it could help find permanent sanctuary for the monkeys.

BBC Sport", "text": "Dillian Whyte knocks out Lucas Browne in sixth round in London 24 Mar   Dillian Whyte produced a commanding performance at the O2 Arena Dillian Whyte moved closer to a fight with WBC champion Deontay Wilder with a punishing sixth-round knockout of Australian Lucas Browne at London's O2 Arena. \nThe 29-year-old Briton, who has now lost just once in 24 fights - to Anthony Joshua in 2015, ended Browne's unbeaten record in compelling fashion. \n\"I knew this was going to happen. Deontay Wilder where you at? June - let's go,\" he said afterwards. \nBrowne was treated by ringside medics. \nWhyte had vowed to make his opponent bleed and did so in the first round, opening up a cut under the 38-year-old's left eye that worsened as the fight progressed. \nWhyte was totally in control and had former nightclub bouncer Browne, who briefly tried to rally in the third, in trouble throughout with his jab speed and powerful right hand. \nIt was a left hook that ended the contest and resulted in Browne needing treatment, before eventually getting back to his feet to walk out of the ring after the stoppage. \nHe was taken to hospital as a precaution. \nWhyte, who is ranked number one by the WBC, remains the prime contender for a potentially lucrative contest against that organisation's high-profile champion Wilder. \nWilder, however, will be ringside at Joshua's fight with Joseph Parker next week, and could try to pursue a huge unification fight with the winner of that bout. Whyte found plenty of success with his right and ended the bout with a powerful left hook \nFellow heavyweight Tony Bellew said he was relieved Browne, who appeared slow and cumbersome from the second round onwards, was able to walk away. \n\"I'm just happy Browne has left the ring himself and not on a stretcher,\" he tweeted. \"Whyte has announced himself on the world scene. Browne is usually an extremely durable man. Wasn't tonight.\" \nWhyte said the win proved he can win a world title. \n\"Hopefully he's OK, he showed up and tried,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I proved I'm world class. My training paid off. I'm a good fighter but people haven't seen it yet. \n\"I need the challenge there. Lucas Browne thought his power was incredible. I might not have 22 knockouts but I can crack. \n\"When people stand in front of me it's a different story.

They include Vishal Vora, who has quit London for Berlin and says \u201cBritain really seems broken now\u201d, and Liz and Gary Trow, who have relocated to France, saying that their daughter is enjoying a more multicultural environment.\nSome of the escapees have been setting up their own businesses, while others have managed to secure equivalent or even better jobs. And some have used this as a chance to make a career switch. And, rather than isolating themselves in the traditional expat enclaves, many are keen to embrace the local communities in their host countries.\nIn the week it was announced that the UK and EU have reached an agreement on a Brexit transition deal , Guardian Money spoke to three families who have upped sticks about how difficult it was to make the move and how they are coping.\n\u2018For an academic Britain is finished\u2019 Vishal Vora is happy to describe himself as a Brexit refugee. The 37-year-old says that \u201cfor an academic, Britain is finished\u201d so, following the June 2016 vote, he and his family decided to emigrate.\nHe is a legal academic and his wife, Abbie, is a magazine journalist. They have three children: Ramona, five, Grayson, two, and baby Margot, who is two months old.\nVora got a research fellowship in Germany and the family moved to Berlin last autumn. They have swapped their former home in Stoke Newington, north London \u2013 where they were \u201cliving like Victorians, four of us in a tiny one-bedroom flat ... many people wondered how we managed\u201d \u2013 for a beautiful and spacious \u201caltbau\u201d (old-build) flat in the centre of the German capital.\nHe adds: \u201cMy salary is \u20ac51,000 (\u00a344,500). We rent a 122 sq metre three-bedroom flat in the city centre with tenure for life, and the \u20ac1,835 (\u00a31,600) a month rent includes heating, water and housekeeping. The only extra is electricity, which is around \u20ac50 (\u00a344) a month. By contrast, my monthly mortgage payments on my 27 sq metre flat in London are \u00a31,000.\u201d\nI wanted to give my children the best start and for the basic stuff \u2013 housing, education and healthcare \u2013 to be sorted\nMeanwhile, the couple\u2019s children are in free full-time kindergarten, which Vora says would have cost \u00a31,800 a month in London. They have traded a car for a family cargo bike. Vora works outside Berlin and pays \u20ac400 (\u00a3350) a month on train fares. The family reckon food is pricier in Berlin but of better quality.\nVora says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be fair to blame Brexit entirely for our decision to leave the UK, though it played a big part. The problems in this country stem from what happened in Thatcher\u2019s reign: selling housing stock and not replacing it and privatising public services.\n\u201cThe UK has been neglected for decades and it shows: public transport is a joke, the NHS is falling to pieces, the education system is broken. I wanted to give my children the best start in life and I wanted the basic stuff \u2013 housing, education and healthcare \u2013 to be sorted. I feel in a country like Germany, this stuff \u2013 basic human rights, perhaps, in the western world \u2013 is sorted and doesn\u2019t cause me sleepless nights.\u201d\nAs a consequence, the difference between their lives in London and Berlin \u201cis as clear as night and day. Although we rent here, this isn\u2019t seen as a failure: 83% of the population rents with secure tenure. It\u2019s a contract for life, should we choose to stay here.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cFull-time childcare is free and medical care is superb \u2013 my wife gave birth to our third child here eight weeks ago. She was able to stay in hospital for four days, we never felt pressured to go home and they provided everything for the baby. We had two other children in London at a top teaching hospital, and the difference was huge. My wife was basically asked to leave within 12 hours of giving birth.\u201d\nVora is a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, which is funding his post-doctoral research into the role of legal identity among British Hindus, while Abbie gave up her permanent job in the UK to allow him to take this position. \u201cShe will begin freelancing in the next 12 months or so, but at the moment is enjoying being a full-time mother of three,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI visit London often for work and it will always be home, but with great regret, until the basic stuff is sorted \u2013 which won\u2019t happen in my lifetime \u2013 I don\u2019t see myself moving back. I value quality of life far too much to ask my family to put up with all of the above just to live in London. Things are going to get worse for the UK before they begin to get better.\u201d\n\u2018I had no connection here any more\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liz and Gary Trow have moved to France with their 12-year-old daughter.\nLiz, 35, and Gary Trow, 40, made the decision to start a new life in France with their daughter, Lara, 12, soon after the referendum.\nUncomfortable with the result, the couple felt they were in a minority in the Dorset coastal town of Poole, where there was a higher-than-average vote in favour of leaving the EU (58.2% versus 51.9% for the UK as a whole).\n\u201cI\u2019m worried it makes the UK seem unwelcoming to people from other countries,\u201d says Liz. \u201cAs an accountant I can see this affecting the stability of small businesses who rely on a continuous supply of European employees.\nIt\u2019s such a wonderful way to bring a child up - it\u2019s so different to what we were doing in the UK\n\u201cWith my grandad passing away, I felt I had no real connection or need to be here any more. No one was depending on us \u2013 it just felt like this is the time to do it.\u201d\nThe couple sold their house in Poole and bought a farmhouse and gite in the Loire valley, leaving the UK in March 2017. They relaunched Les Vigeants as a triathlon holiday centre and hosted their first guests last May.\nHaving come from an area where the majority of the population are white British (88%, according to 2011 census data for Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch), the couple are happy that their daughter is growing up in a more multicultural environment. \u201cThe children round here are fluent in English and they are fluent in French, and have Dutch friends as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a wonderful way to bring a child up \u2013 it\u2019s so different to what we were doing in the UK.\u201d\n\u2018A kneejerk reaction after the vote\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Terence Sheehan and his partner, Emma Holmes, now live in Alicante, Spain.\nTerence Sheehan, 51, and his partner Emma Holmes, 44, both from marketing backgrounds, have been taking Spanish evening classes to demonstrate their commitment to their new homeland since moving to Alicante in Spain, from Chiswick, west London, in June 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s respectful to learn Spanish and be seen to be at least attempt to pick up the language as quickly as you can,\u201d says Sheehan.\n\u201cWe are here not to just kind of mix with the expat community \u2013 we\u2019re here to mix with the Spanish community as well.\u201d\nHe adds that rather than deter them, the Brexit vote acted as a catalyst for the couple to follow through with plans to move to Spain.\nIt made us determined to make that move and to make sure everything worked out for us\n\u201cIt made us determined to make that move and to make sure everything worked out for us, which it has. It was almost a kneejerk reaction when we heard the result \u2013 just to get on with it and do our best. I still can\u2019t believe the way the vote panned out. I\u2019m a European first and foremost.\u201d\nSheehan says the property management company that they have set up, Holmes & Co, started \u201calmost by accident\u201d after a contact of a neighbour in Alicante asked for his help to market a holiday villa. \u201cOne property led to another, and we now look after about 10,\u201d he says.\nSheehan says expats are locked in a guessing game over the Brexit negotiations.\n\u201cPeople are concerned about the impact on their lives and how it will affect them in terms of healthcare, the exchange rate \u2013 will they get the same value for their money? Is the pound going to weaken?\u201d\nHe adds that there is also growing unease among retirees over whether UK pensions are going to be affected.\n\u201cAlso, when we leave the EU, expats are thinking about applying for Spanish citizenship because that will allow them to have the same benefits,\u201d he says.\n\u201cApril 2019\u2019s going to be interesting. But I can\u2019t see too much happening in terms of there being a dramatic change for everyone \u2013 there\u2019s just too much to lose for the Spanish and for the British government.\u201d\n\u2018We lost \u00a350,000 overnight\u2019\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan and Julie Barber have turned their home in Portugal into a bed and breakfast.\nAlan Barber couldn\u2019t believe the referendum result. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure Brexit will happen. To me it made no sense at all,\u201d he says.\nBarber, 61, and his wife, Julia, 57, arranged the completion of their house sale for the day after the vote. They had planned to transfer the proceeds into euros to fund their new life in Castelo Branco, Portugal. But after the vote, the pound fell to its lowest level in 31 years.\nYou can almost see the stress leaving you when you get here\n\u201cWe lost \u00a350,000 overnight,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhen we went to bed, the pound was quite high because everyone forecast that we were staying in, and when we woke up it had gone through the floor.\u201d\nEven worse, a week later and the day before they were to fly out to Portugal, the owner of the house the couple were buying found out they were from the UK and put the price up beyond their means.\n\u201cSo that house fell through and we said to the agent in Portugal: \u2018We\u2019re leaving, we\u2019re on our way, you need to find us something.\u2019 So he found us two schist stone houses, which are in a stunning location \u2013 better than the first one.\u201d\nWith the loss on the exchange rate and higher than anticipated costs on the replacement property, the couple converted their new home into a bed and breakfast.\nIn a nod to their Gaelic roots, Barber called the B&B Casa Tus Nua, which means \u201cthe house of new beginnings\u201d in Irish. \u201cBut in Portuguese it\u2019s the \u2018house of the naked women\u2019, so all the neighbours thought we were opening a brothel,\u201d Barber says. Recently the couple expanded the business by buying the nearby Vale Mour\u00e3o restaurant.\nDespite the initial upheaval, Barber likens their arrival in Portugal to \u201cthe steam rising off a wet jacket in a warm room \u2013 you can almost see the stress leaving you when you get here\u201d.\nTopics Buying property abroad Brexit Europe Consumer affairs Article 50 European Union features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vishal vora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary trow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T10:24:16.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66adcac3954b08d4d5994c5379b2995f2a46d78d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RLcUKz3aO5oyzl62lj_EqiBet26KB02W2zPadu8ffET.UxBRsoBEDHb1OB0RsE7nyPtOsSof0g6w6LltaM.h19ALMjCfU50Cpk.dt7BwDX.E_4Cet6aXGV534vP8Z.SU8qCk1a9jIp8lwJF7itltjgF", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.independent.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent | News | UK and Worldwide News | Newspaper", "title": "Cambridge Analytica: Investigators raid London offices after search warrant granted", "title_full": "Cambridge Analytica: Investigators raid London offices after search warrant granted | The Independent", "published": "2018-03-23T21:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/23/19/cambridge-analytica.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4543, "comments": 0, "shares": 4543}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66adcac3954b08d4d5994c5379b2995f2a46d78d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RLcUKz3aO5oyzl62lj_EqiBet26KB02W2zPadu8ffET.UxBRsoBEDHb1OB0RsE7nyPtOsSof0g6w6LltaM.h19ALMjCfU50Cpk.dt7BwDX.E_4Cet6aXGV534vP8Z.SU8qCk1a9jIp8lwJF7itltjgF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Harriet Agerholm", "published": "2018-03-23T21:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cambridge Analytica: Investigators raid London offices after search warrant granted", "text": "Officers for the Information Commission have begun to search of Cambridge Analytica 's central London offices after a High Court judge granted a warrant.\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham wanted access to records and data in the control of the London-based company amid claims that Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used for political campaigns.\nMs Denham announced on Monday she would seek an urgent warrant to search the offices, but a hearing on the matter was adjourned on Thursday.\nAnalytica : \u2018I\u2019m really sorry\u2019 The warrant was only granted on Friday evening.

off The plane flying from Perth to London will be a Qantas Boeing 787 Dreamliner Credit: Getty Our Foreign Staff 24 March 2018 \u2022 10:53pm \nP assengers have taken off for the first direct flight between Australia and London, passing a major milestone by reducing to 17 hours a trip that once took 12 1/2 days. \nThe 9,000-mile flight from Perth, one of the world\u2019s most isolated cities, marks the first direct passenger service between the continents . \nQantas Airways' inaugural service between the Australian city of Perth and Heathrow took off on Saturday evening and will touch down in London at 5.05am on Sunday before departing for the return trip at 1.15pm that afternoon. \nPassengers will be on board the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft for 17 hours as they make the 9,009-mile journey. \nThis is 24% further than the UK's existing longest route of 7,275 miles, operated by Garuda Indonesia between Heathrow and Jakarta. \nT he new link with Perth will be around three hours quicker than routes which involve stopping in the Middle East to change planes or refuel. \nIt will also enable faster journeys to Sydney and Melbourne than flying via Dubai. \nThe new link is part of Qantas' ambitious plans, unveiled over the past two years, to add ultra long-haul flights to its global schedules. \nThis will eventually include non-stop flights from Australia's eastern seaboard to Europe in an effort dubbed \"Project Sunrise\". \nQ antas chief executive Alan Joyce last year said such flights were \"the last frontier of global aviation ... the antidote to the tyranny of distance and a revolution for air travel in Australia\". \nTravel firm Flight Centre has recorded \"high demand\" for the new Qantas flights . \nIts head of aviation, Justin Penny, said: \"Flight Centre definitely feels that long-term the new route is viable and we will see additional services being launched from Europe to Australia in the coming years.\" Top 10 | The world\u2019s longest flights \nL isa Norman, the flight's captain, said \"we have been working towards (this) for the past three years and it\u2019s very exciting\u201d. \n\u201cWhen I joined Qantas not in my wildest imagination would I have thought this possible,\u201d she told the West Australian . \nCapt. Norman says she will be \u201cabsolutely exhilarated\u201d when the plane touches down in London. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a painter puts the final brush stroke on the work.\u201d Alan Joyce checks in for the first Perth to London direct flight. Possibly the most filmed check in ever at @PerthAirport @7NewsPerth pic.twitter.com/KjKhpbfbdu \u2014 Rob Scott (@Rob7Scott) March 24, 2018 \nA viation consultant John Strickland said the launch of the flights was a significant moment for the airline industry. \nHe told the Press Association: \"It will be a further test of how successful airlines can be with ultra long-haul flying and whether this delivers sufficient profitability to justify the investment in aircraft. \n\"Qantas will certainly be hoping to attract a higher proportion of premium customers due to the speed advantage combined with the 787's better cabin atmosphere.\" \nT he Dreamliners on the Perth-Heathrow route will have 42 business class flat-bed seats, 28 premium economy seats and 166 economy seats. \nThe aircraft boasts a number of advantages over other models, including lower cabin noise, larger windows, improved air quality and technology to reduce turbulence.

The sector also supports financial-services firms such as Hartleys Ltd., whose Perth-based director of corporate finance Steve Kite is booked on Sunday\u2019s flight -- the second in the new service to London -- for just a four-day trip. \n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively an overnight flight for me and that feels like I\u2019m saving a lot of time,\u201d Mr Kite said. \nN ot everyone is convinced of the route\u2019s commercial future. \nAircraft leaving Perth for London will need feeder passengers from around Australia, said Volodymyr Bilotkach, author of the book \u201cThe Economics of Airlines.\u201d But flying from Sydney to London via Perth saves little time over a transfer in Asia or the Gulf, he said. Historic flight Perth-London direct tonight with @Qantas Dreamliner making the first 17-hour non-stop service. Glad to be a part of last night's launch. Sure beats four days and 9 stops in 1947.

Opting for Singapore Airlines via Singapore would take an extra 2 1/2 hours but cost just A$4,843 (\u00a32,600), according to fares on Webjet. \nQantas has challenged Boeing and Airbus to build a jet by 2022 that can fly fully loaded from Sydney to London without a break. Success on the Perth-London service would lay the foundations for even longer routes to Europe. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really just the beginning,\u201d said Merkert at the University of Sydney.

Mindy Kaling, who is in the film, described DuVernay as a \u201cmovement\u201d, and Time magazine wrote about how the movie will change Hollywood.\nReviews suggest the film is dreadful. It has a 40% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes . The Guardian\u2019s Amy Nicholson gave it two stars , and one of those stars was purely for what Oprah did to her eyebrows. I can feel you getting annoyed with me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Romesh, are you against diversity? Are you delighted that the patriarchy has been reinforced by the failure of a film with a female protagonist?\u201d Well, no.\nBefore A Wrinkle In Time came out, you would be hard pushed to find anybody to describe at length what it was about. All the press centred on how great it was to have a female director of colour, to have a female protagonist of colour and how DuVernay \u201cwasn\u2019t just casting actresses\u201d but \u201cleaders \u2013 icons\u201d. I\u2019m not suggesting any of this is bad, by the way. This is obviously long overdue. But why does everyone have to bang on about it so much?\nTrumpeting diversity undermines what you are trying to achieve in the first place. It should happen without fanfare. There are people who are opposed to this sort of thing, and so when a film wears diversity on its sleeve, and then falls short, they throw up their hands and say things like: \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t do things based on merit\u201d and, \u201cDo you remember the good old days when black characters were played by white blokes?\u201d Nobody wants these people to be happy. These people should be presented with diverse films and not told this is part of \u201ca movement\u201d. This is just how it is.\nHow did I handle casual racism in Los Angeles? Awkwardly | Romesh Ranganathan Read more\nMaybe I\u2019m being unfair. DuVernay probably did not want to focus on these aspects of the film, but that was all she was asked about. And there\u2019s something distasteful about me ignoring all the struggles she will have had as a black female director in Hollywood as I focus on how the film is being promoted. But I do think we all have a responsibility to push the discussion of these sorts of films away from \u201ca cause\u201d.\nA recent Kermode and Mayo podcast featured a listener who had written to say they had found Black Panther a bit boring, and hoped that its shortcomings did not remove Hollywood\u2019s appetite for films with a black superhero at the fore. You what, mate? I remember being chased out of school by bullies throwing eggs. I ran to where my mum was waiting. She flipped out and started battering the bullies with her handbag. For two weeks, everyone called me Mummy\u2019s boy and the girl I was going out with split up with me because she couldn\u2019t take the embarrassment. That fortnight was more fun than watching Batman v Superman, but I don\u2019t remember anyone saying that movie was going to undermine the future of films with white men saving the world.\nBlack Panther is a great film . It has the most compelling villain of any Marvel movie, and it deals admirably with the issue of diminishing jeopardy in a million superhero films where the world is going to end. It also has an almost completely black cast and some kick-ass female characters. It deserves to be judged on its own merits. We should not be talking about this film as a giant leap forward for movie-making; we should be talking about it as one of the most exciting Marvel films for a while. I would also argue that a film set in Africa having a lot of black characters in it should probably be a given, and also that Wesley Snipes must be bloody furious that everyone\u2019s forgotten about Blade .\nGhostbusters is another example. After it was announced the \u2019Busters would all be women, breaking all stereotypical traditions from the original film except for the one with the underwritten one-dimensional black character (\u201cYou guys are really smart about this science stuff, but I know New York and can borrow a car from my uncle!\u201d), the internet cracked under the pressure of a million fanboys expressing disdain from their mum\u2019s basement. The director, Paul Feig, was forced to defend these decisions and the film became a cause, with some reviewers scared to criticise it. It underperformed at the box office and the unfortunate consequence is that a load of internet losers think they\u2019ve been proved right. You can find them now campaigning for the destruction of every copy of The Last Jedi .\nAnnouncing a diversity initiative, or making it a cause, exerts unwanted pressure. This is not restricted to movies. When the BBC\u2019s then director of television, Danny Cohen, announced that it would put at least one woman on every panel show , this made the job of every woman on a panel show more difficult. All three of them were livid. In short, we should all be pushing to make more diverse films, TV shows and business opportunities.

Now they'll get to see Perth too,\" he told the BBC. Melbourne will also benefit from a connecting flight. \nFierce competition from Asia-based airlines should also put pressure on fares, Dr Wilkie said. What's it like flying for 17 hours in economy? \nSingapore Airlines abandoned its previous flight to New York after deciding that 19 hours was too much to tolerate in economy. A move to convert the entire aircraft into business class was not financially sustainable. \nNow experts are looking at ways to minimise the toll that long-haul flights can have on passengers in economy. \nProf Steve Simpson, from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, works with Qantas to study the impact of such a long flight on the human body. He describes it a test of human endurance. \n\"Your circadian rhythm takes cues off food and light, and this flight disrupts it,\" he said.

(Express photo/Vishal Srivastav) \nThe BJP in Uttar Pradesh scored a major victory on Friday by bagging nine out of 10 Rajya Sabha seats, days after it lost two crucial seats \u2013 Phulpur and Gorakhpur \u2013 in the recent Lok Sabha bypolls in the state. The remaining one seat went to the Samajwadi Party . Out of the 58 seats, the BJP has won 12 of the 25 seats in seven states as 33 candidates from 10 states were elected unopposed. \nWhile addressing reporters at the party office in Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath congratulated all MLAs of the party as well as of the allies. \u201cIt is a major victory for the BJP in UP. All the nine candidates of the party have won the Rajya Sabha elections,\u201d he said. The CM also blamed the Bahujan Samaj Party \u2019s (BSP) loss on the Samajwadi Party\u2019s (SP) \u201copportunism\u201d as it failed to transfer votes.

I hope they effectively voice the aspirations of the states they will represent,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \nREAD | Rajya Sabha Elections Results 2018 LIVE UPDATES \nSoon after the results were declared, state BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey said it was a victory of democracy and would boost development-oriented politics in the state. \u201cThis is the victory of democracy and it is for the welfare of Uttar Pradesh,\u201d he told media persons. \nBesides Union Minister Arun Jaitley , who is the party\u2019s most prominent winner, Ashok Bajpai, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav, GVL Narasimha Rao and ninth candidate Anil Kumar Agarwal, who pulled off a surprise win with the help of second preference votes, made it to the Upper House of the Parliament. \nOn the other hand, SP\u2019s candidate Jaya Bachchan won with the help of first preference votes, defeating BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar in the prestigious battle of ballots, touted as a test for the new-found bonhomie between the parties headed by Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati . \nREAD | Cross-voting charges fly thick and fast in Rajya Sabha elections \nAfter the success of the SP-BSP alliance in the Lok Sabha bye-elections in the two constituencies, the parties faced a tough competition against the BJP on Friday. With one BSP MLA believed to have cross-voted and two others in jail being denied permission to vote in the polls, the Opposition faced a challenge of numbers to ensure victory for their second candidate. \nMoving the poll panel against the two MLAs who are believed to have cross-voted, deputy leader of the BSP in the state Assembly, Uma Shankar Singh, said, \u201cWe have given a written complaint to the Election Commission that our MLA Anil Singh did not show his vote to the election agent of the party before casting it and we are awaiting a reply from the EC in this regard.\u201d BJP candidate Anil Jain celebrates his victory with his family. (Express photo/Vishal Srivastav) \nThe SP also lodged a similar complaint with regard to MLA Nitin Agarwal, who had switched sides after his father quit the party and joined the BJP recently. \u201cNitin Agarwal cast his vote without showing it to the election agent and we have demanded the cancellation of his vote,\u201d SP MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said. \nWhile the ruling BJP was confident of bagging eight of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats, the SP fielded Jaya Bachchan and the BSP, Bhimrao Ambedkar, for the remaining two seats.

TNN | Updated: Mar 24, 2018, 08:30 IST Highlights The party called off celebrations planned to mark the victory of its lone candidate Jaya Bachchan to show its solidarity towards the BSP SP had fielded Jaya Bachchan as its candidate with 10 MLAs to spare for the BSP nominee as per the tie-up with Mayawati The celebrations included a dinner at a five star hotel in Lucknow and a \"Bhajan sandhya\" at the party office Akhilesh yadav (File Photo) LUCKNOW: With the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate, backed by Samajwadi Party (SP), losing to BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls on Friday, will the bonhomie between the two arch rivals - who came together to hand out a stunning defeat to BJP in the recently-concluded byelections in UP - continue? The first strong signal, despite the loss, came from BSP national general secretary and Mayawati 's close aide Satish Chandra Mishra, who said that the \"SP did its best in supporting the BSP candidate.\" SP was equally receptive. The party called off celebrations planned to mark the victory of its lone candidate Jaya Bachchan to show its solidarity towards the BSP. \"We had the required votes to secure Jaya Bachchan's victory and had planned celebrations in advance. But, party chief Akhilesh Yadav cancelled the programme once results began pouring in,\" said Akhilesh's close aide and SP MLC Udaiveer Singh. The celebrations included a dinner at a five star hotel in Lucknow and a \"Bhajan sandhya\" at the party office where apart from Akhilesh and Jaya Bachchan, party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was also slated to attend among other top leaders. According top priority to his alliance with Mayawati in the Rajya Sabha polls, Akhilesh deputed some of his senior and trusted MLAs to vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) nominee on Friday. The move, that may have put to risk SP's own candidate, is being seen as an attempt of the SP chief to win over Mayawati for a more formal and strong alliance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Akhilesh picked trusted MLAs to vote for BSP With a total of 47 MLAs, SP had fielded Jaya Bachchan as its candidate with 10 MLAs to spare for the BSP nominee as per the tie-up with Mayawati ahead of the Lok Sabha bypolls. However, after party MLA Nitin Agarwal joined BJP just days before the RS election and another MLA Hari Om, who was in jail, was denied permission to vote, the party was left with only eight extra MLAs. This when the party had already assured support of at least nine MLAs to the BSP supremo in the RS polls. Taking no chances that could disrupt the new found SP-BSP bonhomie, SP insiders said Akhilesh went ahead to mend fences with independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh who was a member of his cabinet in the SP. Eventually, Raghuraj announced his support to Akhilesh at the SP\u2019s dinner party held on Wednesday. Thereafter, the SP chief hand-picked some of his most trusted legislators to vote for the BSP candidate to ensure that the party did not cut a sorry figure in case some of the party MLAs switched loyalties at the last moment. The final list of MLAs who would vote for the BSP was drawn on Thursday evening. On Friday, top SP leaders including leader of Opposition in assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary, Akhilesh\u2019s two trused MLAs Subhash Pasi and Shailendra Yadav alias Lallai\u2014who was the SP\u2019s polling agent for the RS elections\u2014voted for BSP, according to senior party leaders. \u201cThe list also included names like Manoj Paras, Nahid Hasan, Rafeeq Ansari, Virendra Yadav, Prabhu Narain Singh and Gauriganj MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh, who was the host of the SP dinner held on Wednesday,\u201d said a party MP who was privy to the list. \u201cPutting his trusted men in the list goes on to show that Akhilesh kept weak links with himself to vote for the SP candidate and in case of any crossvoting, it could have put the party candidate\u2019s election in jeopardy,\u201d said a political commentator. Political observers describe Akhilesh decision to depute party veteran like Ram Govind Chaudhary and Shailendra Yadav Lallai among others to vote for the BSP as an attempt to send a message across to the BSP leadership that he has not only lived up to the \u201cdharma\u201d of the SP-BSP tie-up but at the cost of putting to risk the election of SP\u2019s otherwise secure candidate.

It is already assured of eight seats on the basis of its strength in the assembly. Anil Singh said he had cast his vote and showed it to BSP agent Lalji Verma and the rest could be known from him.

According to Uma Shankar, 17 MLAs of the total 19 had cast their votes by midday and shown them to Verma. \"We are not very sure about Anil Singh as he was not present either in the meeting last night nor in the breakfast with party chief Mayawati this morning,\" Uma Shankar said.

The BSP leader exuded confidence that all the nine surplus MLAs of the Samajwadi Party as well as seven of the Congress and one of the RLD have voted in favour of his party candidate. \"All the seven Congress MLAs went together to vote, while the SP has given us a list of their loyal MLAs,\" Uma Shankar said. The BSP, which has fielded the second opposition candidate, is already short of one vote in the event of the court's refusal to let Ansari vote. Independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi said he was with 'Maharaj ji' and would vote for the BJP. There are 11 candidates for 10 Rajya Sabha seats and 37 first preference votes required for victory in each seat. Since the BJP and its allies have 324 seats in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the saffron party can easily bag eight of the 10 seats and will still be left with 28 surplus votes as the four-MLA strong Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has decided to go with the ruling party. \"There can be some contest on the ninth seat,\" a senior UP BJP leader said. The Samajwadi Party, which has fielded Jaya Bachchan, and the BSP, which nominated Bhimrao Ambedkar, appeared confident of winning one each of the remaining two seats.

BJP allotted 39 MLAs apiece to its first eight candidates though it needed only 37 to make them win. That left only 12 MLAs of the NDA (which has 324 MLAs) for BJPs ninth candidate, Anil Agrawal but BJP made sure he sailed through by the second preference votes cast enmasse for him by the 324 NDA MLAs. \"No chances were taken for the first eight candidates as we did not want any invalid votes to mar our chances,\" a senior UP BJP leader told ET. Senior MLAs were alloted to the three prominent candidates, Arun Jaitley, GVL Narsimha Rao and Anil Jain, as a further precautionary measure. Each candidate was also allotted a senior Minister who ensured the allotted MLAs cast their vote for their enmarked candidate - senior UP minister Satish Mahana for example oversaw the MLAs who voted for Arun Jaitley. Senior Union Minister Piyush Goyal was sent to Lucknow on Thursday to strategise the moves along with CM Yogi Adityanath and both leaders remained in close touch with all MLAs to ensure they voted as per the plan. Goyal supervised a mock voting drill of all NDA MLAs on Thursday as many of them were first-time MLAs. BJP also succeeded in getting three upper-caste MLAs outside its camp to vote for its ninth candidate, Anil Agrawal who ultimately got 16 first preference votes instead of 12 alloted for him by NDA. Nishad party MLA Vijay Mishra, Independent MLA Amanmani Tripathi and BSP MLA Anil Singh voted for BJPs Anil Agrawal. Independent MLA Vinod Saroj may have voted for Agrawal too. Saroj is loyal to independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh who said he voted for SPs Jaya Bachchan but went after voting to meet Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. \"We knew the BSP candidate will not reach 37 vote mark as one of that party's MLA was cross voting for us while one BSP and one SP MLA were denied permission to come out of jail and vote.

Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Updated: March 23, 2018 5:26 pm MLAs flash a victory sign as they are seen from a window waiting for their turn to cast vote for the Rajya Sabha in Lucknow on Friday. (PTI Photo) \nAs the polling on ten seats in the 245-member Rajya Sabha began in Uttar Pradesh, talks of cross-voting appeared to play spoilsport for the opposition, especially for BSP\u2019s ninth candidate, Bhim Rao Ambedkar. While each political party claimed that their votes were intact, some MLAs shifted their loyalties claiming that they voted in favour of \u201cMaharaj ji\u201d, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. \nA neck to neck fight continued between BJP\u2019s ninth candidate, who appeared short of atleast five votes and BSP candidate who was short of three votes, at the time of filing this story. Challenges for BSP\u2019s Ambedkar increased after party MLA Mukhtar Ansari and SP MLA Hariom Yadav was not allowed to vote by the court. \nFollow Rajya Sabha Elections 2018 LIVE UPDATES HERE \nAs the voting began at 9 am, SP MLA and former Minister Shivpal Yadav was among some of the early voters in the assembly. Amid talks of cross-voting, Shivpal hinting at Jaya Bachchan assured that \u201cboth the candidates would win\u201d. Earlier in the day, CM Adityanath, also visited BJP Legislative Party office to meet the MLAs. \nHowever, as the day progressed, NISHAD party lone MLA Vijay Mishra made it clear that he had voted in favour of BJP to keep the unity of the country alive. \u201cDesh ki akhandata, bharstachara mukti\u2026desh ke gareeboon ko dhyan me rakhte hue vote diya , (Voted for unity, corruption-free country, keeping in mind the poor people of India),\u201d said Mishra. The shift in allegiance comes on the heels of Gorakhpur bypolls where the party had supported the SP-BSP combine. Soon, BSP MLA Anil Singh also claimed that he listened to the \u201cinner voice\u201d and went with \u201c Maharaj ji \u201d. \u201c Antaratma ki awaj mein Maharaj ji ke sath chalegaye ,\u201d said Singh. \nThe cross-voting changed the arithmetic of votes for the opposition, especially with independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, clearing in a tweet that his support for Akhilesh does not mean his support for BSP. \u201cNa main badla hun na meri rajnaitik vichardhara badali hai. Main Akhilesh ji ke sath hun ka yeh artha nahi ki main BSP ke sath hun.\u201d tweeted Singh. \nMeanwhile, SP MLA Nitin Agarwal, whose father Naresh Agarwal had recently joined BJP, also made it clear that he voted in favour of BJP candidate and so did independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi. After casting his vote, Nitin said, \u201c Samajwadi Party chose someone who entertains the society, people will not accept her.\u201d \nCongress, which has seven MLAs in the state, had announced its support to BSP candidate issuing a party whip. Congress assured that their MLAs had not gone against the whip and voted for BSP. \nWhile the opposition alleged BJP of \u201chorse-trading\u201d, the party clarified that they have not approached anyone and that the support from various leaders was being offered as they expressed faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CM. \u201cWe are going to win all the nine seats. It is not we, who started this. In fact, BSP with just 19 MLAs fielded their candidate, so they started it. Since we had 28 additional votes for the ninth candidate we fielded too and all of them will win,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.

While the ruling BJP is assured of eight of 10 Rajya Sabha seats for which voting was underway today, the Samajwadi Party has fielded Jaya Bachchan and the BSP Bhimrao Ambedkar for the remaining two seats. As the parties totted their numbers, BSP MLA Anil Singh indicated that he had cross-voted in favour of the BJP, saying \"I am with Maharaj-ji\", a reference to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The Unnao MLA's vote could be crucial as it gives the BJP the edge in getting a ninth Rajya Sabha seat from Uttar Pradesh. However, reports also said that he met UP CM Yogi Adityanath after casting his vote. The Allahabad High Court has denied permission to BSP's Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in Banda jail, to vote in the Rajya Sabha elections. And a court in Firozabad has rejected a petition by SP MLA Hariom Yadav, who is in Firozabad jail. The Opposition is now banking heavily on the two votes of Independents -- Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya and his close associate and MLA Vinod Saroj. Both appeared set to vote for SP's Jaya Bachchan, prompting party chief Akhilesh Yadav to thank Raja Bhaiya and post a picture with him on Twitter. Raja Bhaiya, who has had a rocky relationship with BSP chief Mayawati, had tweeted this morning that he was with \"Akhileshji\" and specified that it did not mean that he was with the BSP. The BSP did not take an adverse view of Raja Bhaiya's comment. \"... had he any reservations he would have said openly,\" said BSP deputy leader in the Vidhan Sabha Uma Shankar Singh. He added that he could not be sure that Anil Singh had voted for the BSP candidate. Keeping it ambiguous, Anil Singh said that he had cast his vote and showed it to BSP agent Lalji Verma and the rest could be known from him. \"I have cast my vote after showing it to Lalji Verma and he will tell you the details... I am with Maharaj-ji (Adityanath),\" he said after voting at the Tilak Hall in the Assembly complex. According to Uma Shankar, 17 MLAs of the total 19 BSP legislators had cast their votes by midday and shown them to Verma. The BSP leader exuded confidence that all the nine surplus MLAs of the Samajwadi Party as well as seven of the Congress and one of the RLD have voted in favour of his party candidate. \"All the seven Congress MLAs went together to vote, while the SP has given us a list of their loyal MLAs,\" Uma Shankar said. Independent MLA Aman Mani Tripathi also said he was with 'Maharaj-ji' and would vote for the BJP. There are 11 candidates for 10 Rajya Sabha seats and 37 first preference votes are required for victory in each seat. Since the BJP and its allies have 324 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the saffron party can easily bag eight of the 10 seats and will still be left with 28 surplus votes as the four-MLA strong Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party has decided to go with the ruling party. \"There can be some contest on the ninth seat,\" a senior UP BJP leader said. BJP candidates in the fray from Uttar Pradesh are Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Ashok Bajpai, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav and G V L Narasimha Rao.

An LMC team will conduct a survey to determine the number of vendors in a ward to be granted permission. \n\nMunicipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh has directed the committee working on tobacco-related issues to prepare a draft for the licence system which can be implemented soon. \n\nHe said, \"We aim to implement licence system for tobacco vendors from the next financial year.\" \n\nTill date there is no regulation of tobacco products' sale and vendors opened shops wherever they wished. Many are also seen flouting the guidelines of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003 (COTPA) which restricts sale of eatables at tobacco shops. The rule also says that there should be no tobacco shop within 100 metre periphery of a school. \n\nLMC is planning to keep the licence fee considerably high to discourage people from selling tobacco products. As per the latest Global Adult Tobacco Survey , the consumption of tobacco has declined in India, but has shot up in UP. \n\nTIMESVIEWIt is a good move but success will depend on following three factors: 1) It will be a herculean task for the LMC to enroll tobacco vendors given the huge number of shops across the city. 2) LMC will have to put a dedicated team for issuance of licences and monitoring to catch violators. 3) LMC's track record in implementing such measures has been poor. For examples, many tobacco shops can be found around schools and colleges in violation of law. Hence, implementation would require seriousness on the part of senior officials.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "uday raj singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow municipal corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:07:04.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 177, "moreResultsAvailable": 167, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746438729&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3ALucknow&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 860, "extra": {"place": "Lucknow", "country": "IN", "lat": "26.8466937", "lng": "80.94616599999999"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "site_full": "www.infoconcert.com", "site": "infoconcert.com", "site_section": "http://www.infoconcert.com/rss/news.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Infoconcert - News", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "title_full": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://statics-infoconcert.digitick.com/media/artiste/artiste_suite/details/thom_yorke2018_120x150.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22927, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "text": "23/03/2018 RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !

Milos, who struggled with injuries in the second part of 2017 and scored just one win in the first three tournaments he played this year, found a good form at Indian Wells and he advanced into his first semi-final since Lyon last May and the first at Masters 1000 level since Paris 2016. \nOn the other hand, del Potro came to the desert with a lot of confidence, winning the title in Acapulco (his first above ATP 250 level after 2013) and he scored challenging wins over Leonardo Mayer and Philipp Kohlschreiber in order to reach the semi-final. \nBoth players were eager to give their best and earn the place in the final but it turned out to be a rather one-sided affair, that lasted just over an hour. Del Potro controlled the match from start to finish, losing eight points on serve and never facing a break point. \nThe pressure was on Milos and he couldn't handle it, dropping almost half of the points in his games and making too many errors to it an exit door in just over an hour. Working with Goran Ivanisevic, Milos tried to make more net rushings here at Indian Wells but it didn't work against del Potro who tamed his shots nicely to keep the points on his racquet and dominate the scoreboard from start to finish. \nThe Argentinian had 25 winners and just 11 errors in total while Raonic stood on a negative 21-28 ratio that couldn't bring him the better result. The Canadian had 13 service winners but that wasn't enough to keep his service games safe without a strong first groundstroke after an initial shot. \nDel Potro was returning well and imposing his shots after a few exchanges, sending deep and precise balls from both wings to keep Milos without an answer and forcing him to make a lot of errors. They had a similar number of direct points from the field but Raonic needed much more than that if he wanted to stay on the court more since he found it hard to control his strokes, both from the baseline and at the net. \nIt was a calm and collected game from del Potro that we also saw in the final against Roger that gained him the advantage on the court, sailing through his service games, moving around the court nicely to cover every part of it and taming his shots to have the upper hand in both the short and longer points. \nThe Argentinian was 15-13 in front in service winners and 10-8 in the direct points from the field, which could only mean trouble for Raonic. The Canadian sprayed 15 unforced errors compared to only seven from Juan Martin and they were on a similar distance in terms of forced errors, with 11 for Milos and only three for his rival. \nDel Potro had the upper hand in the shortest points up to four strokes with a 31-19 advantage, losing just three points behind his first serve and firing his first groundstroke with more efficiency than Milos. He was also 14-10 in front in the mid-range exchanges from five to eight strokes and 8-3 when the point would reach the ninth shot. \nPoint by point result and the number of shots in the rallies: \u2193 SHOW RESULTS \u2193 \n1.

In 2015, the Lyon plant manufactured 40 million tubes and bottles. \nIn 2019, GGMCF will reportedly be able to produce up to 85 million of tubes and bottles - more than twice the amount delivered in 2015. To bolster this growth, the factory has also doubled its emulsion production capacity. \n\u201cThe expansion of our Groupe GM Cosm\u00e9tiques France factory in Lyon is an important investment for Groupe GM as it responds to the growing demand for our products\u201d \u200b, said Laurent Marchand, President of Groupe GM. \n\u201cIn the future, these investments will enable Groupe GM to have sufficient production capabilities and grow our company\u2019s position as a leading amenity brand. Our priority is to develop partnerships with new brands and international chains, but also with new agents and distributors.\u201d \u200b \nExpanding production capabilities \u200b \nBy summer 2018, the factory is set to grow from 4000m\u00b2 to 5200m\u00b2. \nTo combat growing demand, the company is also planning to purchase nine new machines in 2018, expanding the plant\u2019s production capabilities to 31 machines in total, with the possibility of adding three to five more machines in the future. \nPersonnel growth is another element in the initiative: staff numbers have already grown from 50 to 85 workers. By summer 2018, the plant will reach 100 employees, representing a doubling in staff levels over the last year alone. \nSpecific roles are to be created to assist with the plant\u2019s transformation, as well as a dedicated employee working on laboratory and the bulk production. In addition, new supply chain software has been rolled out to streamline processes. \nInternational expansion \u200b \nThe move comes soon after the French company announced the expansion of its international distribution \u200b network, which included four new distributors in Asia and Brazil. \nThe expansion formed part of Groupe GM\u2019s plans to consolidate its worldwide presence.

Seg\u00fan Marta Fern\u00e1ndez Melgarejo, directora de Marketing de TC Group Solutions y responsable del estudio, \u201cel webrooming se impone al showrooming en las calles comerciales espa\u00f1olas\u201d. 2017 ha sido un a\u00f1o de bajada generalizada en la tasa de atracci\u00f3n comercial, con decrementos en los porcentajes de entradas a las tiendas que van desde los 1,5 puntos (Barcelona) a los 0,5 puntos (ciudades del Grupo III). En cambio, en todas las ciudades analizadas, ha aumentado favorablemente la tasa de conversi\u00f3n a ventas: entre los 3,6 puntos (Madrid) y los 0,3 puntos (ciudades del Grupo III). Menos visitantes pero, a la vez, m\u00e1s dispuestos a efectuar su compra en la tienda f\u00edsica en lugar de deambular por la tienda evaluando los productos y acabar saliendo con las manos vac\u00edas.El comportamiento del consumidor es el de practicar menos showrooming (visitar las tiendas f\u00edsicas para evaluar un producto que finalmente se acaba adquiriendo online) y m\u00e1s webrooming (cuando se analiza el producto en la red pero se realiza la compra en la tienda f\u00edsica). El informe se\u00f1ala que en Espa\u00f1a, el 37,6% de los clientes que entran en una tienda a pie de calle acaba comprando algo.El mensaje de la conferencia del Dr. Carles Torrecilla fue claro: \u201csolo cruzando los datos del mundo online con los del mundo offline podr\u00e1, el retailer offline, convertir la amenaza en oportunidad y competir, o convivir, con el mundo online en igualdad de condiciones.\u201d Pero, por otro lado, Torrecilla tambi\u00e9n hizo hincapi\u00e9 en que \u201ctanto dato e informaci\u00f3n hace que adem\u00e1s debamos poner especial atenci\u00f3n a la legalidad de la recogida, almacenaje y tratamiento de la informaci\u00f3n, por lo que debemos estar muy atentos a que nuestros proveedores de servicios cumplan con la legislaci\u00f3n en continua evoluci\u00f3n.\u201d La segunda conclusi\u00f3n que se extrae del estudio de este a\u00f1o 2017, es que \u201cel Black Friday\u201d llega a Espa\u00f1a para quedarse\u201d. La jornada de grandes descuentos Black Friday se ha convertido en una semana de aumento de tr\u00e1fico peatonal en las calles Comerciales espa\u00f1olas, con un aumento medio del 11% evidenciando que, cada vez m\u00e1s, los espa\u00f1oles aprovechan para concentrar sus compras pendientes e incluso avanzar los regalos de Navidad.En Madrid, el Black Friday fue el d\u00eda de m\u00e1s tr\u00e1fico peatonal del a\u00f1o 2017 en con una media de 7.891 transe\u00fantes en sus principales v\u00edas comerciales.La jornada de descuentos super\u00f3 en afluencia al periodo navide\u00f1o de a\u00f1os anteriores. Sin embargo, la cifra registrada fue menor a la de 2016, cuando el lunes 4 de enero se lleg\u00f3 a los 8.047 peatones. Otro mensaje extra\u00eddo de la presentaci\u00f3n de este estudio es la importancia de conocer el Coste por Cliente Potencial. Este indicador (CCP) combina el tr\u00e1fico medio de la calle con la renta media de alquiler de los locales comerciales de la misma, ofreciendo como resultado un valor en euros por cada cliente potencial que pasa frente al escaparate de una tienda ubicada en dicha calle.Esta edici\u00f3n, el informe ha escogido la calle Fuencarral en Madrid, para analizarla en profundidad, junto a las calles Pelayo (Barcelona), Tetu\u00e1n (Sevilla) y Jaime III (Palma de Mallorca).En la calle Fuencarral, un espacio comercial de 80 m2 est\u00e1 pagando 4,14 c\u00e9ntimos de euro por cliente potencial, frente a los 2,7 c\u00e9ntimos de euro que costar\u00eda la calle Pelayo de Barcelona, los 2,58 c\u00e9ntimos que pagar\u00eda en la calle Tetu\u00e1n de Sevilla o los 3,9 en Jaime III de Palma de Mallorca.Finalmente, el Estudio, que agrega todos los sectores de la distribuci\u00f3n (a excepci\u00f3n de supermercados, restauraci\u00f3n y estaciones de servicio, dado que el comportamiento de los consumidores es claramente distinto), dedica un cap\u00edtulo completo a estudiar por separado el comportamiento del consumidor de moda, entendiendo como moda las tiendas de ropa, calzado y complementos. Este consumidor, que en los dos \u00faltimos estudios protagonizaba el mercado barcelon\u00e9s, se ha desplazado a Madrid como capital de la moda. La media de clientes diarios de una tienda a pie de calle del sector moda, en Madrid, es de 154, 28 m\u00e1s que en Barcelona, 59 m\u00e1s que en las ciudades del Grupo II y 82 m\u00e1s que en las del Grupo III. Contenido del informe El tercer Informe Big Data sobre el Comportamiento del Consumidor se ha realizado a partir de los millones de datos recopilados por los sensores inteligentes instalados en las calles comerciales de toda Espa\u00f1a, junto con las miles de entradas de clientes y las transacciones que se realizan diariamente en los puntos de venta, siempre almacenados y tratados de manera an\u00f3nima, agregada y acorde con la legislaci\u00f3n vigente.Estructurado en cuatro cap\u00edtulos, en el primero presenta el comportamiento del tr\u00e1fico peatonal (por d\u00f3nde se mueve, qu\u00e9 d\u00edas de la semana, a qu\u00e9 horas\u2026) de las calles comerciales de Espa\u00f1a, clasificadas en tres grupos de ciudades:\u2014 Grupo I: metr\u00f3polis nacionales de m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de habitantes, Barcelona y Madrid, estudiadas por separado.\u2014 Grupo II: metr\u00f3polis regionales de primer orden, de 300.000 a un mill\u00f3n de habitantes, estudiadas de forma agregada (Valencia, Sevilla, Bilbao, Zaragoza y M\u00e1laga).\u2014 Grupo III: metr\u00f3polis regionales de segundo orden (200.000-300.000 habitantes), tambi\u00e9n estudiadas en conjunto: La Coru\u00f1a, Vigo, Oviedo, Santander, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Pamplona, Valladolid, Salamanca, Alicante, Murcia, C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00e1diz, Granada, Palma de Mallorca, Tenerife y Las Palmas.En el segundo cap\u00edtulo se toma una calle representativa de cada grupo para analizarla en profundidad, a lo que han denominado radiograf\u00edas: la evoluci\u00f3n del tr\u00e1fico y afluencia seg\u00fan las horas del d\u00eda y los d\u00edas de la semana, los precios de alquiler de los locales comerciales y, en consecuencia, el coste por cliente potencial de cada una.El tercer cap\u00edtulo compara los ratios de atracci\u00f3n y de conversi\u00f3n de las distintas ciudades, es decir, cu\u00e1ntos de estos transe\u00fantes est\u00e1n de paso y cu\u00e1ntos realmente entran en las tiendas con alguna intenci\u00f3n de compra o curiosidad y cu\u00e1ntos de ellos efect\u00faan alguna compra o salen con las manos vac\u00edas.Finalmente, el \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo estudia por separado el sector moda, entendiendo como moda las tiendas de ropa, calzado y complementos. Los anteriores cap\u00edtulos incluyen todos los sectores de la distribuci\u00f3n, a excepci\u00f3n de supermercados, restauraci\u00f3n y estaciones de servicio, puesto que el comportamiento de los consumidores es claramente distinto.

Ranging from tourism projects to strengthen the peace process in Colombia to initiatives in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, addressing climate change in Mexico or providing insight into management and sustainability systems in Honduras or Panama. A total of 14 case studies portray the contribution of tourism to advance the Sustainable Development Goals in the Americas. \u2018 Tourism and the Sustainable Development Goals: Good Practices in the Americas \u2019 recommends to pay critical attention to tourism management as well as to strengthening partnerships between national and international public and private stakeholders, as well as local communities. The report also addresses the emergence of a more responsible traveler and how destinations in the region should integrate resource efficiency and multi-stakeholder involvement in their policies, actions and initiatives. \u201cWith more than 200 million international tourists who traveled to the Americas in 2017, tourism can and must play a significant role in delivering solutions for sustainable development in the region\u201d, said UNWTO Secretary-General, Zurab Pololikashvili. \u201cI am grateful for the partnership with the Organization of American States and am confident that together we will support tourism's role in the sustainable development agenda of the region up to and beyond 2030\u201d, he added. According to the Executive Secretary for Integral Development of the OAS, Kim Osborne, this joint effort \u201cprovides greater awareness on how tourism can help address poverty alleviation, protect biodiversity and cultural heritage, and support community development in the Americas\u201d. Authorities at all levels in the Americas have identified tourism as a priority sector to promote economic development and diversification and countries across the region are adopting new legislation and policies in this direction.

EFE Actualizada 24/03/2018 a las 17:43 Etiquetas Deuda Efe. Madrid \nLa agencia de calificaci\u00f3n de riesgo Standard & Poor's (S&P) ha elevado este viernes la nota de Espa\u00f1a un escal\u00f3n (desde BBB+ a A-), de aprobado alto a notable bajo, tras constatar el efecto limitado que sobre la econom\u00eda espa\u00f1ola han tenido las tensiones pol\u00edticas en Catalu\u00f1a . Adem\u00e1s, S&P sit\u00faa a Espa\u00f1a en perspectiva positiva, lo que deja la puerta abierta a adicionales subidas de nota en los pr\u00f3ximos 24 meses si Espa\u00f1a avanza a\u00fan m\u00e1s en el proceso de consolidaci\u00f3n fiscal (rebaja del d\u00e9ficit p\u00fablico) y si la incertidumbre asociada a Catalu\u00f1a sigue remitiendo. De esta forma la agencia sigue los pasos de Fitch , que en enero subi\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n la nota a Espa\u00f1a, con lo que fue la primera de las tres grandes agencias que lo hac\u00eda desde 2015. Asimismo, S&P ha elevado su previsi\u00f3n de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico para 2018 al 2,7% frente al 2,6% que calculaba en noviembre pasado, aunque con la perspectiva de que el avance se modere en el horizonte de 2019 a 2021. La agencia explica la subida de nota en la fortaleza de la econom\u00eda, el super\u00e1vit de la balanza por cuenta corriente y en la positiva evoluci\u00f3n del proceso de reducci\u00f3n del d\u00e9ficit p\u00fablico. Como punto menos positivo, S&P incide en que la fragmentaci\u00f3n parlamentaria restringe la capacidad del Gobierno para implementar medidas presupuestarias o reformas estructurales, lo que se constata en el retraso que llevan los presupuestos generales del Estado para 2018. Al respecto, no descarta la posibilidad de un adelanto electoral, aunque tampoco cree que se puedan llegar a revertir las reformas llevadas a cabo en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Entre los desaf\u00edos pol\u00edticos m\u00e1s recientes a los que se enfrenta el Gobierno , la agencia destaca las demandas de los pensionistas y de buena parte de la oposici\u00f3n para que las pensiones suban en l\u00ednea con los precios, en lugar del m\u00ednimo del 0,25% establecido por ley. El informe se\u00f1ala que la demanda interna seguir\u00e1 siendo la principal locomotora de la econom\u00eda, con la expectativa de que el consumo privado siga creciendo gracias al mantenimiento de la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. La agencia prev\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n un aumento de la inversi\u00f3n, as\u00ed como una recuperaci\u00f3n del sector de la construcci\u00f3n y la vivienda. Adem\u00e1s, espera que el sector exterior se siga beneficiando de su fuerte competitividad y del aumento de su cuota en el mercado global, aunque alerta del riesgo de un aumento global del proteccionismo y del encarecimiento del petr\u00f3leo. De la tasa de paro dice que sigue siendo la segunda m\u00e1s alta de la UE , a pesar de estar muy lejos del m\u00e1ximo alcanzado a principios de 2013, en tanto que prev\u00e9 que en 2018 se siga reduciendo hasta el 15,6%. La agencia avisa de que la perspectiva podr\u00eda bajar a estable si el crecimiento de la econom\u00eda es m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil de lo esperado, si la deuda p\u00fablica sobrepasa el 100 % del PIB -aunque calcula que ir\u00e1 reduci\u00e9ndose hasta el 86 % del PIB en 2021- o si se deteriora el super\u00e1vit de la balanza por cuenta corriente. Tambi\u00e9n, si una escalada de las tensiones en Catalu\u00f1a lastra la inversi\u00f3n y la confianza empresarial. Sobre Catalu\u00f1a, a\u00f1ade que de momento la incertidumbre persiste a la espera de ver la direcci\u00f3n que toma el pr\u00f3ximo gobierno auton\u00f3mico que todav\u00eda no se ha formado.

Compartir Men\u00e9ame \nEn su an\u00e1lisis, la agencia se\u00f1ala que ni la evoluci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica ni presupuestaria de Espa\u00f1a se ha visto obstaculizada por las tensiones en Catalu\u00f1a y ha expresado su confianza en que el PIB de Espa\u00f1a crecer\u00e1 \"m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido\" que la media de la eurozona entre 2018 y 2021, permitiendo la continuada reducci\u00f3n del d\u00e9ficit. \nS&P se\u00f1ala que la perspectiva positiva del rating supone que podr\u00eda mejorar la calificaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola en el curso de los pr\u00f3ximos 24 meses si el Gobierno logra una mayor consolidaci\u00f3n de las cuentas p\u00fablicas de lo que espera actualmente. Asimismo, la agencia prestar\u00e1 atenci\u00f3n a la influencia de la pol\u00edtica monetaria del BCE en las condiciones de cr\u00e9dito del pa\u00eds, as\u00ed como a la evoluci\u00f3n de la banca espa\u00f1ola y apunta que \"una relajaci\u00f3n adicional de las tensiones en Catalu\u00f1a tambi\u00e9n respaldar\u00eda una mejora\" . \nREACCI\u00d3N DEL GOBIERNO \nTras conocerse la decisi\u00f3n de la agencia, el ministro de Econom\u00eda, Industria y Competitividad, Rom\u00e1n Escolano, ha destacado que la subida del rating por parte de S&P, s\u00f3lo dos meses despu\u00e9s de la de Fitch, confirma la confianza en Espa\u00f1a de los mercados y las agencias de calificaci\u00f3n crediticia. \"Es un reconocimiento, adem\u00e1s, del esfuerzo reformista en distintos \u00e1mbitos llevado a cabo por el Gobierno y la sociedad durante los \u00faltimos seis a\u00f1os. Nuestra econom\u00eda se sustenta en un crecimiento robusto, con fuerte creaci\u00f3n de empleo y reducci\u00f3n del d\u00e9ficit p\u00fablico\", indic\u00f3 el ministro, se\u00f1alando que \"S&P pone a Espa\u00f1a en perspectiva positiva, lo que nos permite augurar nuevas subidas en el futuro\". \n\"La agencia considera que las tensiones pol\u00edticas en Catalu\u00f1a han tenido un efecto limitado sobre la econom\u00eda espa\u00f1ola, gracias a la confianza institucional que introdujo la aplicaci\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 155 de la Constituci\u00f3n.

Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo remained sat on the bench but it is safe to assume the jeers were in response to another unused substitute. Thousands of supporters had bought tickets on the strength of the promo pictures of Lionel Messi, back in town for the first time in 18 months, but Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli deprived many of a once in a lifetime opportunity. \nFriday night's meeting between the four-time and double World Cup winners still featured ample Premier League interest. Seven Argentinians and three Italians play in England, Nicolas Otamendi was starting in his own back yard, Angel di Maria was back in Manchester and there was also the odd transfer angle for those in the press box. \nNapoli's Brazil-born Azzurri midfielder Jorginho is interesting Liverpool and United, who view Jorginho as a potential replacement for Michael Carrick. It was another Italian midfielder who Mancunians marvelled at on their international evening. Twenty-three minutes in, Marco Verratti, collected the ball in line with his own six-yard box, danced past one Argentinian, then another and then one of his own teammates before he emerged from the Italian area. It was the closest fans got to seeing Messi. Read More United player ratings of the season so far \nThree years ago, Gary Neville awoke after watching Paris Saint-Germain eliminate Chelsea from the Champions League and succinctly said: \"Morning. Verratti - what a player! Thanks.\" \nMourinho will remember that night vividly. PSG's resolute performance is one of the standout 10-man showings in recent memory and Verratti's formidable 82-minute display should encourage United to touch base. \"Verratti bossed the midfield,\" Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry opined. \nUnited's Mino Raiola stable has halved in the last two months and he represents Verratti, whose Instagram post last summer excited gullible United supporters still celebrating the Romelu Lukaku coup. Verratti apologised for his previous agent Donato di Campli's behaviour and his change of representative in the transfer window was enough to make the player go viral. Or the agent, in Raiola's case. Verratti started for Italy with Jorginho \nRaiola trended on Twitter rather than Verratti and there are not many better holding players in world football than PSG's dynamic Italian. Verratti was never considered by United last summer as Mourinho focused on Premier League pedigree in Nemanja Matic or Eric Dier but the circumstances have changed. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku were all advised to join United over other clubs by their Italian-born agent and Raiola reputedly threw a chair in frustration during negotiations with Borussia Dortmund over Henrikh Mkhitaryan. \nThe furthest PSG have progressed in the Champions League under their Qatari-ownership is the quarter-finals and they reached that stage back in 2013. If ever, or whenever, they do lift the European Champion Clubs' Cup it will be a hollow, petrodollar achievement and the suspicion is some are getting impatient. Read More Two United players send a message to Jose Mourinho \nVerratti was petulantly sent off in their limp defeat to Real Madrid earlier this month and must be the most coveted of the 'old guard'. Verratti is one of three players listed in the quarter-final matchday squad against Barcelona still at the Parc des Princes. \nThis is the 25-year-old's sixth season in Paris and summer after summer he tops rival supporters' midfield wish-lists. If United are to sign an Italian midfielder to complement Matic and Paul Pogba then it should be Verratti rather than Jorginho, who has only hovered onto elite European clubs' radar in the current campaign. \nSigning Verratti would be another statement signing by United but a team focused one. After pipping Chelsea to Romelu Lukaku and using Real Madrid like pawns as Alvaro Morata was left by the road side, Verratti appeals as Barcelona barely conceal their desire to sign him. \nHe would also sell tickets. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.

The 21-year-old signed a new contract in October and has played 18 times this term. \nEven after his 'worst performance' against Brighton in the FA Cup quarter-final last week, McTominay was praised by Mourinho. \n\"You have the kid that didn't play well at all and I told him already,\" Mourinho said. \"Was the one I first spoke individually with in the dressing room, and instead of being critical with him I was positive with him. Because you play very bad but did the basic things that a player has to do and one of the basic things is to keep emotional balance. A fan asks Mourinho for a selfie \n\"To play with that red shirt - which is a heavy one, is a heavy shirt to wear - and the kid in his worst performance by far, he was there. He was not afraid to play, he played bad and every player can play bad. \n\"Scott played on his [Matic's] side, Scott played the worst match since he played with me in the first-team, but he is a Manchester United player for sure, because he's the player that made mistakes, passed the ball so bad tonight, lost so many passes. \n\"But big personality to cope with a mistake, big personality to say and to think I am not playing well but at least I will do the basic things of the game, which is to keep position, give balance to the team, recover balls, don't make defensive mistakes. But a few of the other guys were scared to play.\" Read More United might have already found their next number 10 \nMourinho has previously flown to Croatia, Austria and Sweden during international fortnights over the last year to watch prospective signings. The United manager flew to Croatia last year amid interest in winger Ivan Perisic and reportedly watched Red Bull Leipzig's Emil Forsberg play for Sweden against Italy in November. \nThe Portuguese watched Austria beat Serbia in an October World Cup qualifier that Nemanja Matic scored in. Midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who has been heavily linked with United, was not included in the Serbia squad. \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.

She was there one minute and the next minute she was gone.\u201d \nSpeaking after the hearing, Mechelle said Maizy \u2018was just our everything\u2019. Maizy with mum Mechelle and nana Jean \nThe youngster first contracted the form of blood cancer in August 2012 when she was aged just 10, it was heard. \nShe was diagnosed after she complained of pain in her legs as she ran for the bus. \nAfter \u2018gruelling\u2019 chemotherapy and several years of follow-up treatment she was given the all-clear in January 2015. \nHowever, in December 2016, Maizy and her family got the devastating news that the disease had returned after she complained of feeling tired. Routine tests showed abnormalities in her blood. \nJust a month later she died after suddenly deteriorating whilst undergoing more chemotherapy in the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s hospital (RMCH), an inquest heard. \nShe suffered a second and fatal cardiac arrest after developing sepsis as a result of her illness, the hearing was told. Read More Maizy was granted her birthday wish to ride in a pink limousine \nCoroner Angharad Davies described her as a \u2018delightful young woman whose life was tragically cut short after she had shown such strength and determination in fighting back\u2019. \nDuring the inquest, the family questioned if the E-coli infection she was suffering from could have been spotted, and treated earlier, for example being moved onto the paediatric intensive care unit sooner than she was. Maizy Burke, 14, died following a battle with cancer in January 2017. (Image: Steve Marsland) \nAn internal investigation by the hospital trust into Maizy\u2019s death was carried out and consultant Dr Denise Bonny, who oversaw it, said the stretched resources and busy wards did sometimes impact on communication with patients\u2019 families. \nHowever, she said she believed \u2018all the right things were done at the right time\u2019 in respect of her treatment. \nMaizy has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare form of cancer of the white blood cells which prevents the body fighting off other infections and viruses. \nAssistant coroner Angharad Davies ruled the decisions made by all the doctors and nurses caring for her were \u2018appropriate\u2019 given the information available to them. Maizy Burke celebrating her 14th birthday with friends \nRecording a conclusion Maizy died of natural causes Ms Davies said: \u201cMaizy\u2019s family have raised a number of issues that have caused them concern. \n\u201cIt seems to me the staff caring for Maizy had complex decisions to make and it was a balancing act. \n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t find any of those decisions were inappropriate. \n\u201cThere is no evidence earlier treatment would have changed or delayed the outcome for Maizy. \n\u201cYou have my very deepest sympathies about her death but also the devastating impact the circumstances, the fact she deteriorated so quickly, have had on you.\u201d Read More Primary school children paid an amazing tribute to former pupil Maizy Burke \nSpeaking after the hearing, Maizy\u2019s mum Mechelle, 49, said the entire family\u2019s world had been turned upside down. \nShe said: \u201cShe was just our everything. She loved singing, dancing. She was so popular, had so many friends. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a cruel disease. But just the day before she died she was sat up and talking to everyone. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the bit, especially her brother and sister, are struggling to come to terms with. \n\u201cI never thought she would die. She was so strong. \n\u201cWe\u2019re just devastated. Even now it doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d \nGot a story or an issue you want us to investigate?

By his own admission in a post for The Players' Tribune, he was 'almost f*cked' because he was so green and sheltered.\n\"I look back on the last 10 years of my career, and I've won the World Cup, the Champions League, \u200bLa Liga , Copa del Rey\u2026I've won it all, as I like to remind my Madrid friends on WhatsApp ,\" he said.\n\"But 10 years ago, I was almost f*cked. My whole life could have turned out very different if it wasn't for Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\"I arrived at \u200bManchester United a boy, and I left a man. It was a crazy time for me, because I had never been away from home before. I spent my first 17 years growing up in Spain in \u200bBarcelona 's youth academy, and it almost felt like I was playing for the local school team or something. I knew everybody there, and I was close to my family.\n\"To me, football was just fun. I didn't understand the business side of the game at all. Then I arrived at United, and honestly, it was a complete shock.\"\nHaving never played for the Bar\u00e7a first-team before he left home, Pique took his first steps in professional football at United, making his debut against lower league Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup and playing three times by the end of the 2004/05 season.\nPique returned to Spain on loan to play for Real Zaragoza in 2006/07, before playing 13 times as United completed a \u200bPremier League and Champions League double in 2007/08.\n\"Sir Alex was phenomenal to me from the very first day,\" he recalled.\n\"The best managers all have this quality - even when they're not playing you, and even when they're hard on you - they make you believe that they really care about you. Sir Alex was like a second father to me. He made me earn it, but eventually he gave me my chance.\"\nThe standards at United were incredibly high and it wasn't just Ferguson who upheld them, as Pique found out when, at the age of 18, he was berated by Roy Keane when his phone had rung in the dressing room before one of his very first games at Old Trafford.\n\"I was nervous as hell. Imagine it - I'm 18 years old, and I'm sitting in that little dressing room putting on my socks next to Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand. I wanted to be invisible. I was thinking, Just do your job and go unnoticed,\" Pique said.\n\"We're sitting there waiting for the gaffer to come in and speak to us, and I'm literally sitting right next to Roy Keane. The dressing room is so small that our legs are almost touching. There's no space at all. It's dead quiet. All of a sudden, you could hear this little vibration.\n\"I realise it's my phone. I left it on vibrate, and it's in the pocket of my pants, stuffed in the clothes bag that's hanging right behind Roy's head.\n\"Roy can't find where the noise is coming from. Now he's looking around the room like a maniac. His eyes are darting everywhere, and he's trying to figure it out.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA six minute service could be introduced on more Metrolink lines - and more double trams will be put on to deal with jam-packed rush hour carriages. \nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has announced that 27 new trams will be added to the network in the next two years, boosting capacity by 25 per cent. \nIt will mean nearly 5,000 extra seats for passengers - and more double trams. \nAll lines currently run a 12-minute service. Where multiple services run along the same line, frequency is around six minutes between relevant stops. \nAt peak times, there is a six-minute service between Manchester and Bury; Manchester and Altrincham ; on the Eccles line as far as MediaCityUK; on the East Didsbury line; and from Rochdale via the Oldham line as far as Shaw and Crompton. (Image: Manchester Evening News) \nTransport bosses say the new trams - which will cost \u00a380m - will primarily be used to boost capacity when the network is at its busiest. \nThere is the potential this summer for current stock to extend the MediaCityUK to Etihad Stadium service to Ashton, providing a six-minute service on the Ashton line. \nThe extra trams are part of a huge \u00a3240m plan to cut congestion in Greater Manchester. \nMr Burnham hailed the investment as a \u2018major increase in capacity\u2019 and said extra security across the tram network would also be addressed, alongside \u2018more regular and frequent\u2019 services. Read More Greater Manchester to get 27 more trams and new 'pre-peak' Metrolink tickets as part of \u2018Congestion Deal\u2019 \nHe said the government has proposed giving Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) powers to issue civil injunction orders banning troublemakers from the network - and said 50 extra PCSOs are due to start work on public transport networks, specifically the Metrolink, by the end of April. \nAn extra \u00a3160m is also being invested in the region\u2019s cycling and walking infrastructures. \nIn the largest public transport investment announcement in years, Mr Burnham also asked the public to do their bit to tackle congestion, in what he called a \u2018deal\u2019 with commuters. Andy Burnham (Image: Manchester Evening News) \nOutlining a range of new ideas and funding plans Mr Burnham said he wanted to \u2018unlock the potential for thousands of people to move around by cycling or walking without reliance on private car use\u2019. \nHe told the M.E.N.: \u201cPeople have experienced growing levels of congestion. There is nothing we can do to wave a magic wand. \n\u201cIt is a difficult issue but there are some things that we can do. We are setting out a new approach, one which is based on a deal with the public. \n\u201cThere are things that we can put in place, but they are intended to create incentives to change what people do - to move away from the car.\u201d \nThe money is coming from the Transforming Cities Fund, announced by the government last November. \nAll regions with a city mayor were told they would get cash. Greater Manchester has now been told what the money can be spent on. \nExact details are still being worked out and the plans are due to go before the region\u2019s combined authority next week. \nBut car sharing, the possible creation of a \u2018high occupancy vehicle lane\u2019 pilot scheme, giving priority to cars with three or more passengers on some of the busiest roads, are included. \nBusiness are also being urged to do their bit. Mr Burnham vowed to work with firms to encourage flexible working hours and starting times to stagger traditional rush hours and reduce bottlenecks. \nHe said a \u2018new package of incentives\u2019 would be explored, including offering workers at companies who sign up \u2018early bird\u2019 Metrolink discounts. No prices have been confirmed. Read More Manchester Airport to invest 'six-figure sum' in public transport links \nA group Metrolink discount could also be offered to firms that agree to implement flexible working. \nEx-Olympian Chris Boardman, the region\u2019s cycling and walking Tsar, would get a budget of \u00a350m a year from 2019/20 for three years to create a \u2018world class\u2019 cycling infrastructure for Greater Manchester, the mayor said. One idea is dedicated safe cycling routes to schools. \nOn Twitter Mr Boardman said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t just going to \u2018build infrastructure\u2019. We are going to build space people want to be in. Travel can be an enjoyable part of the day. We have forgotten that.\u201d (Image: MEN Media) \nThe investment covers \u2018walking infrastructure\u2019 and Mr Burnham said it could mean road lay-out changes, pavement alterations and new design strategies to boost pedestrian safety. \nA Manchester-wide scheme to improve junctions, tackle bottlenecks, build new roads and roll out \u2018smart\u2019 traffic signals is also planned, alongside reducing the impact of roadworks through better control, coordination and information. \nA 24/7 transport control centre would also be developed, to keep passengers up to date minute-by-minute across all forms of public transport, alongside a dedicated management team to govern and monitor some of Greater Manchester\u2019s busiest routes.

Nony Basco, ABS-CBN News/file photo \nMANILA- Architect and urban planner Felino \"Jun\" Palafox on Saturday criticized the plan to build a casino-resort in Boracay island amid government's efforts to rehabilitate the top tourist destination. \nPalafox said construction should not be allowed on Boracay's white-sand beaches since it will damage the quality of the sand. \n\"It might be the wrong land use at the wrong place at the wrong time on a personal basis and a professional basis,\" Palafox told ANC.

Palace defends $500-M casino-resort plan in Boracay \nBoracay tourism stakeholders have also expressed dismay over the planned casino construction. \nBoracay Foundation board member Connie Helgen said the island, known for its picturesque waters and sunsets, should not be marketed as a gambling destination. \n\"Boracay island is for beach lovers. Boracay is a wholesome destination. Why go to Boracay to play casino? There are so many casinos in Manila and in Macau,\" Helgen said. \nThe government has tapped Palafox's team to help rehabilitate Boracay during the planned shutdown of the island. \nPalafox is proposing a rehabilitation plan which features more eco-friendly structures. \nIf he was to have his way, Palafox said it might be better to build the casino on the mainland in the town of Malay in Aklan. \nThe veteran architect also agreed that there should be a limit to the number of tourists allowed in Boracay. \n\"So many plans have been done in Boracay but the institutions are not in place and there is issue of governance in all hierarchy of government,\" he said. \nThree government agencies have recommended the closure of Boracay island to tourists starting April 26 to give way to rehabilitation efforts. \nThe cleanup comes after President Rodrigo Duterte's criticism of the tourist destination's environmental woes.

Well, one, because this writer loves going to comic conventions when time permits and loves anything involving superheroes. Another reason is that it\u2019s raking in a lot of controversy from netizens, and the event is already happening tomorrow until Sunday.\nWe\u2019re not saying that it\u2019s ultimately a bad event that everyone should boycott altogether. People might still have fun with the activities, find something cool at the booths, and even meet their favorite celebrities. At the same time, you just can\u2019t ignore the ire of people who were either inconvenienced by the event or just observant netizens airing out their concerns. So allow us to break down some of them.\nManny Pacquiao as event ambassador Sen. Manny Pacquiao makes strong pitch as patron of Comicon Asia in Manila on March 2018, showcasing the best in cosplay, gaming, comics, movies, anime and toys. | via @mariovdumaual pic.twitter.com/hzHe55Qnik\n\u2014 ABS-CBN News Channel (@ANCALERTS) January 17, 2018\nWhen ComicCon Asia was revealed last year, they named Sen. Manny Pacquiao as one of their main ambassadors . Apparently because he starred as a superhero that one time in 2009\u2019s Wapakman. Although he isn\u2019t sponsoring the event, the organizers still expressed that his presence will be \u201cinstrumental in presenting the Philippines to foreign exhibitors and investors as \u2018[the] destination of choice for international conventions.'\u201d\nStill, this announcement struck a nerve to many people because of Pacquiao\u2019s views on same-sex marriage , among other issues. One of them was comics artist Gerry Alinguilan, who canceled his appearance at the convention because of the senator\u2019s involvement. \u201cI cannot forget the statements made by Manny Pacquiao in the past. He called same sex couples worse than animals. Worse, in a now deleted Instagram post, he posted Bible Quote: s that preach that gays should be put to death. As someone who believes in equality for all, I find these statements reprehensible and dangerous. Dangerous because Manny Pacquiao is in a position of political power that would enable him to make his personal beliefs a matter of national policy. That is something I cannot abide,\u201d he said in his blog .\nA questionable copyright clause and here's the fucked up part: they're holding a contest called project x where participants submit ideas for new pinoy superheroes. the catch? oh they just get perpetual rights to the winner's creation which THEY can profit off of and the winners won't be able to sue them for it pic.twitter.com/NitzFGQLz7\n\u2014 \ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcbd | the evil is defeated (@thranduilien) January 15, 2018\nComicCon Asia is holding a contest called \u201c Project X ,\u201d which encourages Filipinos to create original superheroes. According to the Terms and Conditions, all copyright goes to the participant. But the catch is that the organizers will also get the rights to use the character for reproduction and distribution, and they can profit from the creation. Although they will properly credit the participant, people still find it a bit sketchy that the organizers will get money out of someone else\u2019s original work.\nHayley Atwell\u2019s cancellation A post shared by Hayley Atwell (@wellhayley) on Mar 22, 2018 at 7:51am PDT\nAgent Carter star Hayley Atwell recently called off her appearance at the convention , but the reasons were conflicting. The initial statement that ComicCon Asia released said that she canceled due to the \u201cpolitical unrest\u201d in the country. However, Hayley clarified that it was not her words and that the real reason was her work schedule. The same reason she gave when she turned down AsiaPOP Comicon Manila in 2016 .\nBecause of this, people are asking why ComicCon Asia made the assumption and why they made it political. Most especially after presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that it was \u201cher loss\u201d for canceling and that there\u2019s no political unrest here. (Let\u2019s be real: there is .) As of writing, there\u2019s still no statement from the organizers regarding the issue.\nFranco Mabanta is one of the hosts Shame for organizers of ComicCon Asia for choosing Manny Pacquiao, a known bigot and DDS Senator, as the event\u2019s ambassador. And also Franco Mabanta, a BBM/DDS propagandist, as emcee?!\nCome on guys, you can do better!\n\u2014 Ted Pylon (@TedPylon) March 22, 2018\nSome netizens aren\u2019t happy about Franco Mabanta\u2019s presence, mostly because of the contents of his Facebook page . Another reason we\u2019re putting out there is that he made fun of the #MeToo movement and called Jover Laurio of Pinoy Ako Blog an \u201cOgre Lady.\u201d So we\u2019re giving a thumbs down for this part.\nProblems with refunds\nDue to the cancellations of Stan Lee and Hayley Atwell, several fans asked for refunds. Yesterday, ComicCon Asia released instructions that all refunds can be claimed on March 24 and 25, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. This raised a few concerns like if they\u2019re giving back the payment in cash or check. Those who won\u2019t attend the event also asked if there\u2019s another option.\nMeanwhile, many aren\u2019t pleased that it took ComicCon Asia a week to address the Stan Lee refunds. ( He canceled on March 16 .) Fans said that they were told by a certain \u201cAnthony\u201d that their refunds will deposited to their bank accounts.

Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News \nMANILA - Nearly three decades and some 16,000 liposuction procedures later, beauty doctor to the stars Vicki Belo said she still gets excited drawing fat from clients to reveal a sexier and more confident frame, drawing from her own struggles with insecurity. \nLiposuction is still one of the most popular treatments at Belo Medical Group, where 30 percent involve going under the knife and 70 percent are non-surgical. By her own account, Belo said she spent 45,000 hours doing liposuction. \n\"My tip is always find what you love to do, so you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re working. Like ako, I get excited pa rin to do a liposuction. If it makes you a happier person, then I\u2019ve done my calling. It\u2019s a vocation,\" Belo told ABS-CBN News. \nBelo credits late 90s bombshell Rosanna Roces for destroying taboos over liposuction. The sex symbol turned liposuction into a status symbol, she said. \n\"Rosanna Roces was my turning point when you ask when did you become more popular,\" Belo said. \n\"She went on TV and she\u2019s so maingay. 'Nagpa-lipo ako kay Dra Belo, sosyal 'yan at mayaman. Ako kasi nakapunta ako dyan,'\" she said. \n(She went on TV and she's so loud that 'I had lipo with Dr Belo, who is a rich socialite.

Then other kids would say \u2018No, she\u2019s not fat, she\u2019s just ugly'. They would do that to me and I would cry,\" Belo told ABS CBN News. \n\"So the message that came to me was 'Ah ganon pala \u2018yon' (that's how it is), if you\u2019re fat and you\u2019re ugly they give you away,'\" she said. \nShe said she struggled with acne from when she was 11 until she reached 26, even during medical school. \n\"Sabi ko, 'pretty girls don\u2019t know what it feels like, eh ako I have suffered all my life,' so I have empathy and I really want to be the best anti-acne doctor in the world,\" she said. \nBelo counts singer Regine Velasquez as one of her earlier clients, whose back acne problem she cured.

So if somebody said 'You can\u2019t be a derma because your skin is bad.'

That changed last month when she was branded a \"terrorist\" by President Rodrigo Duterte's government. \nThe special advisor to the United Nations on indigenous rights since 2014 was among 600 people accused of terrorism over their alleged links to Maoist rebels in a government document filed in a Manila court in February. \nThe activist, who had condemned alleged rights abuses in the southern Mindanao region where the state is battling an Islamic insurgency and leftist guerrillas, denies the allegations and says she feels like a marked woman. \n\"This is like a target list basically,\" the slightly built, bespectacled 65-year-old from the Kankanaey Igorot ethnic group said in an interview at the UN cultural body UNESCO in Paris. \nWhile waiting to see if the state brings charges, she said she has decided to stay out of the Philippines on the advice of her lawyers. \nTauli-Corpuz is one of several left-wing activists accused by Duterte's government of links to the Maoist rebels with whom he broke off talks last year, after initially saying he would \"walk the extra mile\" for peace. \nDuterte blamed the rebels, whose insurgency has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since 1969, for ongoing attacks on the security forces. \n'Virtual hit list' \nIn its court petition, the justice department asked for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), to be declared \"terrorist organisations\". \nAttached to the submission, seen by AFP, were 600 names of suspected rebels, including Tauli-Corpuz and two other prominent indigenous leaders -- Joan Carling and Jose Molintas -- who have previously advised the United Nations. \nThe targeting of the trio came after Duterte last year accused indigenous Lumad schools of grooming children to become insurgents and threatened to bomb them. \nReacting to the case, U.N. rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said it was \"unacceptable for a special rapporteur acting on behalf of the international community whose expertise is sought by the (U.N.) Human Rights Council to be treated in this way\". \nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said those on the \"virtual government hit list\" were \"at grave risk\". \nTauli-Corpuz, who began campaigning for indigenous rights in her native Cordillera region during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, compared the government list to the lists of suspects used to prosecute Duterte's deadly anti-drugs war. \nPhilippine police say they have killed more than 4,000 drug suspects who resisted arrest, but rights groups estimate there have been more than three times that, including people murdered by vigilante groups. \n\"The president has his police and his death squads who can easily kill people whom they accuse of being terrorists,\" Tauli-Corpuz said. \n'Embarrassing the government' \nThe activist who helped draft the seminal 2007 U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples said she believed she was targeted over her condemnation in December of alleged rights abuses in the southern region of Mindanao, where Duterte is battling pro-Islamic State gunmen. \n\"They (indigenous people) are being displaced, they are being killed, their lands are being taken over, so I made a statement which came out in the newspapers and the government immediately came out and said I was embarrassing the government internationally,\" she said. \nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has insisted there is evidence linking Tauli-Corpuz to the rebels and said she and others on the list \"should see this as an opportunity to clear their names\". \nDuterte, who enjoys wide popularity despite his rights record, has repeatedly lashed out at his domestic and foreign critics. \nLast week, he announced he was pulling the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court, which is examining his crackdown on drugs. \nHe also recently vowed not to cooperate with the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, Agnes Callamard. \n\"You're investigating us, fact finding? Well sorry, do not f*** with me,\" he said, in remarks aimed at Callamard. \nShare ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines&text=U.N.%20expert%20"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vicky tauli-c", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tauli-corpuz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines victoria tauli-corpuz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mindanao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kankanaey igorot", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:51:38.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b53a177b299da1516d6c8022ad0b08ce974ad886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4jm8RaR3bLqKuWrKVtT_W_qdBwirHnNB6RR.1F7sWdRe8oFOW.lNGf5da3cnSL6RddIyiceD41aIY7IYbNXFqzyNkOogOIXsQQvQ9e002zT4LmnEKJ2T2nw--", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entertainment | ABS-CBN News ", "title": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans", "title_full": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans | ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-21T22:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/tvpatrol/03/20/hayley-atwell.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3336, "comments": 6, "shares": 3336}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b53a177b299da1516d6c8022ad0b08ce974ad886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4jm8RaR3bLqKuWrKVtT_W_qdBwirHnNB6RR.1F7sWdRe8oFOW.lNGf5da3cnSL6RddIyiceD41aIY7IYbNXFqzyNkOogOIXsQQvQ9e002zT4LmnEKJ2T2nw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-21T22:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans", "text": "\"Agent Carter\" star Hayley Atwell has penned a letter to Filipino fans -- \"in my own words\" -- after ComicCon Asia announced that she had cancelled her appearance at the weekend event, citing \"political unrest.\" Mar 6, 2018 at 5:05am PST \nThe British actress shared the letter on Instagram Thursday, with the caption: \"My statement.

Photo by author MANILA -- Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen is one of the most loved restaurants in Tagaytay. People line up just to have their fill of authentic Vietnamese food. And since it's only open from Thursday to Sunday, days when Tagaytay is brimming with tourists, diners find it difficult to get a table.\nFortunately, guests who come all the way from Manila, don't need to travel to Tagaytay to satisfy their Bawai's food cravings. Because unknown to a lot of the restaurant's loyal patrons, it actually opened a branch at the ground floor of Uptown Parade in Taguig last year.\n\u201cPeople are surprised we have a branch in BGC,\u201d shared Bawai's owner Virgilio \u201cVer\u201d Tatlonghari.\nThe interiors of Bawai's at Uptown Parade. Photo by author The Tatlonghari family partnered with businessman Anderson Hao, his wife Rhea, and their business partners to open a branch in one of the metro's central business districts. They did not do a formal media launch back then that's why diners were unaware of the new location.\nApart from the branches in Tagaytay and Taguig, Bawai's is also in Nuvali in Sta. Rosa in Laguna, and another one along Katipunan Ave. in Quezon City.\nThis family business is going big, planning to branch out to other areas in Metro Manila. And this success all started from humble beginnings.\nVer Tatlonghari and wife My or more fondly called \u201cBawai Dung\u201d started the restaurant in 2007 after friends and family gave them an idea to offer their home-cooked meals to the public. Bawai Dung is from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and even formally studied Vietnamese cooking in 2006.\n(From left) Anderson Hao and wife Rhea, Bawai Dung and Ver Tatlonghari. Photo by author \"Bawai\" translates to grandmother and the restaurant was named after the family's matriarch because all the recipes come from her.\n\u201cAfter I finished my formal Vietnamese culinary education, I was ready to share my personal recipes. We sought help of our neighbors and their families, trained them to be our cooks, servers, and staff. Then, we opened Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen right in our home in Tagaytay in 2007,\u201d Bawai Dung recalled.\nIt was a small operation back then. The couple converted part of their home into a small restaurant with 36 seats, serving lunch and dinner from Friday to Sunday. Soon, the news spread around Tagaytay about this small restaurant that serves delicious authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Then people, from tourists to politicians, started flocking to the Vietnamese eatery.\nToday, the Tagaytay restaurant expanded its business, opening more tables in the garden area to accommodate more guest and including Thursdays in their weekly operations. The whole family is now involved in the growing business including the couple's five children.\nThe Uptown branch has a seating capacity of 50 guests. It has modern and simple interior with a striking Vietnamese mural on one wall.\nPho Bo or traditional Vietnamese beef noodle soup. Photo by author The menu is the same as the original restaurant. To keep everything authentic, the ingredients are mostly sourced from suppliers in Tagaytay and Vietnam as well. Most sauces, noodles, and other specialty ingredients must be sourced from Vietnam.\n\u201cOur chef here actually trained for six months in Tagaytay before we opened,\u201d Anderson Hao explained.\nGoi Cuon or fresh spring rolls. Photo by author Must-tries are the classic Vietnamese dishes like the Goi Cuon or fresh spring rolls (vermicelli noodles, vegetables, pork, and shrimp wrapped in thin rice paper wrapper and served with peanut sauce), Banh Mi or Vietnamese sandwich, and Pho Bo or traditional Vietnamese beef noodle soup.\nCa Phe Sua Da or iced milk coffee. Photo by author They also serve Ca Phe Sua Nuong and Ca Phe Sua Da or Vietnamese hot and iced coffee. These drinks uses Vietnamese coffee and condensed milk.\nBut probably the restaurant's best dishes come from the entree menu. The Curry Ga or chicken curry is the Vietnamese version of the classic Indian dish. It has a more subtle curry flavor and perfectly seasoned with traditional spices.\nTom Rang Me or black tiger prawns in sweet tamarind paste. Photo by author The Tom Rang Me on the other hand, is pan-cooked black tiger prawns served with a flavorful sweet tamarind paste.\nThe Bo Kho is a beef stew like no other. The restaurant uses top round cut, 12 different spices, potatoes, and carrots. The stew is cooked for eight hours until the meat is fork tender and the sauce has a rich and robust flavor.\nBo Kho or Vietnamese beef stew. Photo by author The best part of dining at Bawai's is you are treated as family.\n\u201cWe treat our customers not only as guests but as honorary members of our own family. After all, they are dining in our own home. Every dish is prepared with love,\u201d Bawai Dung said.\nShare\nSave Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/03/23/18/new-eats-tagaytay-favorite-bawais-opens-branch-in-taguig", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/03/23/18/new-eats-tagaytay-favorite-bawais-opens-branch-in-taguig", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/03/23/18/new-eats-tagaytay-favorite-bawais-opens-branch-in-taguig&text=New%20eats:%20Tagaytay%20favorite%20Bawai"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bawai", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "rhea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tatlonghari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virgilio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson hao", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bgc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taguig bawai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taguig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tagaytay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uptown parade", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:46:14.090+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75752d71ce16798db4255001abb5e901f5299100", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4I6hQcrRk5uJ5NWHNu2Cgpp7iXQfKRGwXeU5kFpygoHd0_v2qoKm4UODvy4Txn9Kn3YAFCRGrOEVYAydOkBJ.bXoA_NFW_DSuwtVPAcuN3Jc-", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://news.abs-cbn.com/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business | ABS-CBN News ", "title": "Immigration lookout order for gambling tycoon Okada issued", "title_full": "Immigration lookout order for gambling tycoon Okada issued | ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-22T05:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.173, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/life/03/22/kazuo-okada.jpg?ext=.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 571, "comments": 1, "shares": 571}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75752d71ce16798db4255001abb5e901f5299100", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4I6hQcrRk5uJ5NWHNu2Cgpp7iXQfKRGwXeU5kFpygoHd0_v2qoKm4UODvy4Txn9Kn3YAFCRGrOEVYAydOkBJ.bXoA_NFW_DSuwtVPAcuN3Jc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-22T05:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Immigration lookout order for gambling tycoon Okada issued", "text": "MANILA -

The ultimate would have been to get 1,100kg, but it didn't happen.\" \nHe also broke the squat record of 435kg with his 440kg squat and broke his own deadlift record of 400kg with a 405kg lift, and bench-pressed 245kg. \nMr Manuel was Australia's powerlifting champion for five years in a row until he attended a meet-and-greet in Western Australia. \n\"I just had to tell them my story and they wanted to watch me train, and I was supposed to do just a few squats.\" External Link: Powerlifting FB \nHe made it to 340kg when disaster struck and he ruptured the tendon in his quadricep. \n\"It was more embarrassing because I was trying to teach people how to squat and I fell on my face.\" \nMr Manuel underwent surgery as soon as he returned to his hometown of Rockhampton, and the long road to recovery began. \n\"The doctor told me it was going to take 18 months and I laughed at him, because normally I recover from injuries quite well, even the major ones. \n\"But this time I think he was right.\" Mental scars \nIt took Mr Manuel a year to get back on track physically, but the mental scars have taken a lot longer to heal. \n\"Even when I did that 440kg swat on the weekend and I was in the hole, I was thinking about it, which you shouldn't when you're doing that. \n\"I was thinking, 'Geez, please don't blow,' and I pushed it up and it was good.\" \nHe was worried even when walking up and down stairs that he could have another rupture. \nThis didn't stop Mr Manuel from training, and even three months after his operation he was back into doing what he describes as \"reasonable\" weights. \n\"Not heavy, but enough to scare the doctors, but I didn't tell them what I was doing.\" \nHe took it day by day, week by week, and within a year he started to get better and made the decision to begin extremely heavy weights \u2014 400kg plus. \nWhile recovering, Mr Manuel had his title and record snatched away by Alex Simon, who lifted 1,077.5kg. \nSo when the ProRaw competition approached this year, it was time to dip his toe back into competition waters. \n\"Originally the goal was just to get back on the platform,\" he said. \n\"But as we started prepping, I realised it's starting to come back again, so I had the goal on the record to take a number one spot.\" \nThe aim was to get 1,080kg and reclaim the number one spot, and he did. The physical toll \nPowerlifting does take its toll, and this is not the first time Mr Manuel has been injured. \nThree years ago, he tore the tendon from his bicep during a deadlift and it cost him that particular competition. \n\"I tried to keep going but I could feel my bicep up around my shoulder and I thought, 'Nah, I'd better drop it'.\" \n\"That's the only time I've lost.\" Photo: Odell Manuel was quietly confident a week before the competition, but he didn't want to talk too much in case he jinxed it. (ABC Capricornia: Inga St\u00fcnzner) \nIt also puts pressure on the joints, and this is even more of an issue considering Mr Manuel has osteoarthritis. \nThis condition is why he ended an NRL career that saw him play for the Warriors, NZ Maori and the Canberra Raiders. \n\"It does get painful at times, but as long as you're taking your fish oils and joint formulas and all that, and that's why we use wraps. \n\"Even though it doesn't stop the joint from clinging together, I think with the wraps it helps me too. \n\"Sometimes it gets sore. I get weeks where I can't walk.\" Driving force \nConsidering powerlifting has caused more injuries than league, what drives Mr Manuel? \n\"I think this is a calling for me. \n\"I believe I was born to lift.\" \nAlthough he played in the NRL, Mr Manuel said he was not a natural player and had to work hard. \n\"When it came to lifting, that was different and later on I knew if I pursued it, I would not be too bad at it.\" \nThe focus now is on the biggest powerlifting competition in the country, the international Big Dog, in October. \n\"If we can get 1,100kg there, that will be really good. \n\"Who knows, we might get more \u2014 but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "odell manuel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manuel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian broadcasting corporation", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T23:11:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8032dfa575e0b072d0687987f7ee5c66621260c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nlWi4Rzc5PX8gpmmzuUspasen91xWHKKTvubt_wrhibkpR2YsZFctenlEsZRu5z.1le10WPwickeoHIPoOFBalTYss8GTn89E", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/au/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport", "title_full": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport | The Guardian", "published": "2018-03-23T07:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cc26d0fc8b0f9e8d935a3663c1b1f09d59c578/0_87_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw&amp;s=730e8e474ae77278de3a98fc2e3e40ba", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2973, "comments": 0, "shares": 2973}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8032dfa575e0b072d0687987f7ee5c66621260c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nlWi4Rzc5PX8gpmmzuUspasen91xWHKKTvubt_wrhibkpR2YsZFctenlEsZRu5z.1le10WPwickeoHIPoOFBalTYss8GTn89E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "theguardian.com", "published": "2018-03-23T07:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Katie Brennan turns to Human Rights Commission to fight AFL decision | Sport", "text": "T he dramatic build up to this weekend\u2019s AFLW grand final escalated further on the eve of the game with Western Bulldogs captain Katie Brennan announcing she will lodge a formal sex discrimination complaint against the AFL with the Australian Human Rights Commission. It\u2019s a savvy legal move that will compel the AFL to completely rethink its approach to sanctioning women.\n\nAFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence Read more \nBrennan\u2019s two-game ban raised immediate allegations of sex-based discrimination . The reason was simple: were Brennan were a man, she would have been asked to pay a fine, instead of being suspended. The sole reason women do not get the option of paying a fine is wage disparity (the average wage for a men\u2019s AFL player is $371,000, whereas AFLW rookies receive just $10,500). Rather than opting to have the women pay smaller fines on a pro rata basis, the AFL went with a different system that results in them being sanctioned more severely.\nThere has been an explosion of public interest in the case this week. There have also been many misconceptions about the relationship between elite sporting competitions and the law. Although sporting competitions are entitled to develop their own rules, those rules must comply with overarching legal obligations. In Australia this includes the Federal Sex Discrimination Act, which prevents discrimination against people on the basis of their sex, except in very specific circumstances.\nBrennan twice appealed the suspension. Surprisingly, her legal team didn\u2019t pursue this line of argument at the first hearing. At the second hearing , she did, represented by a team of lawyers including Jack Rush QC and Bulldogs president, Peter Gordon. The AFL argued that Brennan\u2019s legal team should have raised those arguments the first time around, were barred from raising entirely new arguments the second time around, and were simply trying to have a second bite at the cherry. Disappointingly, the appeals board deliberated for just 15 minutes, gave no reasons for its decision, and dismissed the appeal. The failure to provide an explanation for its decision raised even more legal questions, including the possibility that this was itself a denial of a fundamental legal principle \u2013 that of procedural fairness. \nKatie Brennan falls victim to gender pay gap with AFLW grand final ban | Kate O'Halloran Read more \nAll eyes were on the Bulldogs\u2019 next move. Gordon is a renowned litigator who rarely shies away from a fight and as social media exploded with speculation, a #FreeKatieBrennan movement was launched, including a petition . There was growing recognition that Brennan was a victim of circumstance, and an imperfect system which yielded a result only made possible because there are different \u2013 and more severe \u2013 rules for women.\nOn Friday morning, the Dogs announced that they would not seek an injunction in the supreme or federal court. But then came the kicker. In an unexpected move, the club announced that Brennan is lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the suspension was unlawful on human rights grounds.\nThe Commission will not deal with the case before the grand final this weekend. Brennan will not play. But the lodging of a human rights complaint is a strategic masterstroke that forces the AFL into an impossible position. Here\u2019s why: the Commission is an independent third party, whose job is to investigate human rights complaints and to help parties resolve their disputes. The Commission will ask the AFL to consider the specifics of Brennan\u2019s complaint, before overseeing a conciliation. There, Brennan will sit down with the AFL to air her concerns and the Commission will try to help them both come to a resolution.\nBrennan will almost certainly demand three things from the AFL: that they admit the tribunal system unfairly discriminates against women; that they overhaul the system so that the rules are fair and no other woman will be put in Brennan\u2019s position again; and finally, that her suspension be wiped from the historic record, as a matter of principle.\nIf the AFL does not accede, Brennan can go to the federal court and seek a hearing. The AFL will be taking a huge risk if it allows things to go that far. It cannot afford a formal court hearing where such arguments are thrashed out by teams of lawyers, with QCs getting paid hourly rates comparable to an entire season\u2019s wage for many of the women. \nBrennan grand final suspension shows AFLW needs stand-alone tribunal Read more \nIt would be a public relations disaster for the AFL, and generate significant bad blood with players and fans, including the new audience it has found through the AFLW. Most of all, the AFL cannot afford to risk the chance of a formal federal court finding that its fledgling AFLW competition \u2013 a pillar of its putative commitment to gender equality and equal opportunity for women \u2013 is inherently discriminatory. It would be a disastrous result for CEO Gil McLachlan, and one that he will be desperate to avoid.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s almost certain that the AFL will capitulate at the first hurdle, and accede to some \u2013 and perhaps all \u2013 of Brennan\u2019s demands at conciliation. The AFL will be asked to admit that its system \u2013 while well-intentioned \u2013 wasn\u2019t perfect and produced a perverse result that has left Brennan on the wrong side of history. Her move is a hugely significant one, not just for current AFLW footballers, but for future generations of girls and women who will play the game. A star on the field, Brennan has now laid down a huge challenge to the code off it. The ball is now in the AFL\u2019s court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics AFLW Australian rules football Australia sport comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie brennan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriet cordner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sport western bulldogs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "human rights commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aflw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:23:56.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fe9a46395f85fc0e409b83b36e720d575aba399", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1BNiDBFlZOxxG2LdivEzStphX5eU.ZISApUJWei3ZkraroEiXla5X9dC4jYMKDNs46zry8A70Whm.mqgxFL4M5DdYcSYEcNX2MkJI_EoGlGYXNrbyzB6VzQ--", "site_full": "au.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "title_full": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "published": "2018-03-22T22:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.148, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/FIRvLsJ7EwxbjbRt6yc6qw--~D/cm90YXRlPWF1dG87Zmk9ZmlsbDtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVv/https://s.yimg.com/ea/img/-/180323/5ab42019913d1_stand_off_art_2_5ab42008d5a55.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2070, "comments": 0, "shares": 2070}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fe9a46395f85fc0e409b83b36e720d575aba399", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRgF4n.idUdRWXwudV4tdR1BNiDBFlZOxxG2LdivEzStphX5eU.ZISApUJWei3ZkraroEiXla5X9dC4jYMKDNs46zry8A70Whm.mqgxFL4M5DdYcSYEcNX2MkJI_EoGlGYXNrbyzB6VzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "News", "published": "2018-03-22T22:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Driver stand-off in Melbourne divides Internet as to who is wrong", "text": "Father charged over teen's one-punch death \nDashcam video shows the motorists meeting on a narrow road in Toorak but sparks fly when neither agree to move out of the way. \nThe male driver filming the encounter can be heard expressing his frustration moments before the woman exits her car. \n\u201cYou\u2019re holding up the whole road,\u201d he tells the woman as she makes her way to his window.

No horned helmets \nMs Hejll said it was believed German composer Richard Wagner was partly responsible for the myth of the horned helmet. \nIn one of Wagner's Operas, his dressmaker wanted to emphasise the evil characters and used the symbol of horns to help the audience understand who was good, and who was bad. \nOther European artists also added horns to helmets to make their paintings more dramatic. A Viking isn't a type of person \nMs Hejll said a Viking was actually something you do. \n\"They were not an ethnic group or anything. You were not a Viking. You went on Viking. That was something you did,\" she said. \n\"A person could be a Viking in part of their life but most people and most of your life, you were farmers.\" \nMs Hejll said the long journeys they embarked on could often last four years. \nThe word has now been adopted to refer to the Scandinavian people living at that time. They were smart \nMs Hejll said that when going on a Viking, the men and women did not have any navigation instruments. \nThey often travelled to the same places several times. \n\"Imagine that you set off from the Norwegian coast for example to Iceland and Greenland,\" she said. \n\"How did they know they would land there the second time? \n\"They were skilled sailors, they were skilled navigators. They could read the nature, the currents, the birds, the stars, the winds.\" \nIntricately-made jewellery, artworks and clothing are on display throughout the exhibition, showing they were more than barbaric warriors. Being clean was important \nIf you search for images of Vikings, you'll get a lot of scruffy looking characters from the television series. Photo: It turns out combs were a must-have accessory for men and women. (ABC News: Joanna Crothers) \nArtefacts like washbasins, combs, ear spoons and tweezers actually suggest a lot of pride was taken in their appearance, according Ms Hejll. \n\"Everyone had a comb and I think you have that for a reason \u2014 to make your hair look good.You dyed your yarnto have colours in your home and on your clothes,\" she said. \nAristocrats also woredelicate brooches and jewellery as a sign of their wealth. \nClothes were also important for showing people which region you came from, as Vikings were centred around family. \n\"You would be buried with your personal belongings, and your own traditional dress,\" Ms Hauptman said. \n\"They had heavy brooches and the shape of the brooch tells people which region you're from.\" Women were powerful \nWhen a woman's husband was away on a Viking, a key that hung from her belt was a symbol to everyone that she was the lady of the house. \nWhen a woman's husband went on a Viking to trade, find new land or take part in wars, the woman looked after the farm and were responsible for all the people working on it. Photo: A bronze key with an animal depicted in the middle of the handle.

The behaviour that we exhibit rubs off on the kids. \n\"Making time to eat, eating together, all of these things are kind of important.\" We're supposed to limit our sugar to six teaspoons a day, but do you know how much of it is hiding in some of our most popular groceries? Colour and variety is key \nDietician Nicole Dynan said that when at home, young children should be eating the same meal as the rest of the family. \nShe said she would like to see restaurants make kids' menus more like the ones for adults. \n\"If there was some sort of pasta dish for the adults, it would be nice to have a modified version of that [for children],\" she said. \nMs Dynan said the secret to feeding children was colour and variety, and by thinking creatively it was even possible to get children to eat salad. \n\"They love things like iceberg lettuce, cucumber, carrots.\" \nShe said there was no reason for a restaurant to serve a processed chicken nugget when they could serve real chicken instead. \nMr Pangu said he called his initiative Death To Nuggets because they \"were a good symbol of everything that's going wrong with the food that we're eating\". \n\"Most factory-made nuggets are 30 per cent chicken. What's the rest of it? You probably don't want to know.\" Photo: Thinking creatively can help get children eating.

He believed 24 hours was long enough for people to bring their bins in after they had been emptied.\nMackay Mayor Greg Williamson said in response to complaints, the waste management team within the council had defined \u201creasonable\u201d to be 24 hours when drafting up the proposed local law.\nAlthough the law would now be able to policed, Cr Williamson said the change was not in response to a problem in the region where bins had been left out.\nSince April there had only been 18 complaints about people leaving their bins out on the street and nobody has ever been fined.\nCr Williamson said the purpose of the local law was to give local officers \u201csome teeth\u201d when dealing with people who were doing the wrong thing.\n\u201cLocal officers are out there trying and making sure (Mackay) has an urban environment that looks good,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the case where someone complains that there is a land owner or occupier of a dwelling not doing the right thing by the environment, and people that live in that area, we need this local law or otherwise it is a free-for-all.\u201d\nCr Williamson was insistent that the law wasn\u2019t to raise money and would only be policed if people complained about their neighbours.\nAccording to the draft law, the rightful place for a bin to be kept at a home is \u201cat ground level close to the rear alignment of a building\u201d.\nBrisbane City Council, which allows a fine of $1260, has retained similar working to the old piece of legislation.\nAnother section of the proposed law confirms only the local government- approved tip shop is allowed to take rubbish from the dump.\nShare this on Facebook social-facebook_circle Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle Comments nav_small_down nav_small_up Post Comment Hide Comments nav_small_down nav_small_up Most viewed \u2018Haunted\u2019 by midwife\u2019s sex confession \u2018Haunted\u2019 by midwife\u2019s sex confession Police say Bribie beach deaths suspicious Police say Bribie beach deaths suspicious Sack Smith now!

| Gay Alcorn | Opinion", "text": "I \u2019m a citizen of Melbourne . That\u2019s all. Not an economist, nor a politician, a property developer, a demographer. Just a resident with an affection for the city, with all its flaws and idiosyncrasies.\nAs a citizen, nobody has been able to explain to me clearly why Melbourne, and Australia for that matter, should be absorbing so many new people every year, at a rate far higher than the OECD average, faster than other developed nations, with no feasible plan to cope with it.\nThe epicentre of what former New South Wales premier Bob Carr calls Australia\u2019s \u201cweird experiment\u201d is Melbourne, my town. Melbourne is on the brink of being a city of 5 million and is growing at record rates (Victoria grew 2.3% in the year to June 2017, way above the national average of 1.6%, itself exceptionally high by developed nation standards).\nAustralia's fierce immigration debate is about to get louder Read more\nDear old Melbourne added a quarter of its population in just 10 years to 2016. At this rate \u2013 and projecting population growth is a wobbly science \u2013 it will be home to nearly 8 million by mid-century, overtaking Sydney as the country\u2019s largest city.\nThe impact of this growth is the single most important issue in this town (and no doubt in Sydney, too, and to a lesser extent in Brisbane and Perth). As a lowly if curious citizen, the refusal of any major political party, let alone business groups, for whom the more people the better, to question the pace of growth, even to explain it, is astonishing.\nI read report after report which assume with scant elaboration that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to record population growth. The result is a rumbling backlash, and a justifiable one.\nAt least this debate is now being held, when for too long it was stuck in our debilitating culture wars, with many progressives wary that questioning immigration rates would give succour to racists.\nWe can ignore the Pauline Hansons who want to stop Muslims coming here. We can ignore, too, those elements of Tony Abbott\u2019s argument that one reason for easing immigration is because in Melbourne, \u201cethnic gangs (are) testing the resolve of police.\u201d That\u2019s a dog-whistle.\nBut we can no longer ignore the tougher questions: the majority of our population growth is due to immigration, particularly in the past decade. Around three quarters of immigrants settle in big cities, where the jobs are.\nThose cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, are not coping and this circular argument that all we need is better infrastructure and planning and all will be well is arguing backwards. Can we answer first why we want record population growth, and then discuss infrastructure?\nThe truth is that successive governments, state and federal, have not improved public transport and housing affordability and facilities for the booming outer suburbs anywhere near the rate that is needed for the current population, let alone for the hapless people who arrive each week.\nEven with the will \u2013 and if the public were willing to pay for it \u2013 few state governments could cope with this level of growth. Some of Melbourne\u2019s boom is because people are moving here from interstate \u2013 we can\u2019t control that. Governments have little control over how many babies we have. But we can control immigration, which, absent a population policy, is our de facto population policy.\nThe case for easing immigration is compelling. Even if it\u2019s just for a few years, from an annual permanent immigration intake of around 200,000 to 100,000, to catch up. Even if it\u2019s just so we can take a breath and think about how big this country should be without having it decided for us by default.\nLet me offer two examples from the world\u2019s most liveable city, a wry joke if you live here. We are stuck in traffic, long lines of fumes and angry horns, for weeks of our lives. The state government is spending huge amounts on infrastructure, including Victoria\u2019s biggest-ever public transport project, the Metro Tunnel, an $11bn underground rail project that will add five new stations and ease bottlenecks. When will it open? Around 2025.\nWill our congestion get better? No way. The prediction is that in two decades, half of all car trips in Melbourne at peak times will be congested, up from a third now. And, according to Infrastructure Victoria , that\u2019s taking into consideration the planned road and rail upgrades.\nLet\u2019s take schools. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government a few days ago announced that it would spend nearly $240m to buy land for another 14 schools in suburbs with exploding population.\nEducation minister James Merlino boasted that 10 new schools opened last year, 11 would open this year and nine next year. That\u2019s great. But the Grattan Institute a couple of years ago estimated that Victoria would need 220 news schools within a decade. The school where Merlino chose to make his announcement, the John Henry Primary School in exploding Pakenham, is at capacity and is taking no new enrolments . It opened just last year.\nBusinesses and property developers want more and more people because they want bigger markets and more consumers. Most economists seem to like it because they argue it\u2019s great for the economy although, as a more sceptical Ross Gittins pointed out, the productivity commission has found its net impacts to be \u201cnegligible\u201d .\nAnd it is true that our migrant intake is skewed towards skilled migrants, with a smaller proportion of family reunions, plus this year, 18,750 people on humanitarian visas. There is nothing wrong with our system. The debate is about the sheer numbers, and whether that is serving us well now.\nWhat is immigration for? Who is it for? The most curious argument in favour of large population growth is that, somehow, Australians \u2013 those here for generations and those recently settled \u2013 owe it to the rest of the world to populate quickly. Fairfax\u2019s economics correspondent Peter Martin wrote that \u201cthe rest of the world has granted us a licence to use this continent on the implicit understanding that we populate it.\u201d\nReally? Says who? Fellow Fairfax columnist Jessica Irvine wrote that we need to weigh up the \u201cneeds of Australians versus foreigners\u201d in the immigration debate and she had \u201cnever placed the hopes and dreams of Australians so far above those of foreigners that their needs become unimportant\u201d.\nThat\u2019s bewildering. Apart from our humanitarian intake \u2013 which is a duty for an affluent country like ours \u2013 the primary purpose of immigration is to benefit people who already live here, or at least not to worsen their quality of life. The Productivity Commission made that clear , concluding in a 2016 report that it had \u201ctaken the overarching policy objective of immigration to be maximising the wellbeing of existing Australian citizens and permanent residents\u201d.\nWe have benefited enormously from immigration. We are a land of immigrants. We will, and should, keep growing and much of that growth will be newcomers settling here. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t pause a tad now. Just for a bit. Just so mug citizens like me can ask a few questions about the city I love.\nGay Alcorn is a Guardian Australia columnist Topics Australian immigration and asylum Opinion Population Australian politics Melbourne Victoria Victorian politics comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/tony-abbott-s-economic-argument-against-immigration-is-flawed-20180225-p4z1ml.html", "https://www.smh.com.au/national/there-s-a-case-for-immigration-and-it-s-not-about-us-20180314-p4z4bk.html", "https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/migrant-intake/report", "http://www.rossgittins.com/2018/03/immigration-cheap-and-nasty-way-to-grow.html", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-13/victorian-land-schools-growth-corridors-daniel-andrews/9542598", "http://jhps.vic.edu.au/enrolment/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob carr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alcorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:52:34.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "913cf68410a75daa8c4db29370e48123ec468295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3XZlrofKWTgcXAxJdKnoibSrpFGj.MZjVBC4b287SEPkUU2TnhWE2dDe1r_xnhd2_ImTaWZ_D6bdEfejc27OMkG_3MmkxS0_pSCKzhuZwwmKRIh8Xih3j6hOeTpm2nVnNs_2Dn4deqo3jg49xzUZomm3EI2OcWpV94pX6GjAVNsrn8va_NhxFqQE.fkTfSUUpm4KS.XQH.DvY-", "site_full": "www.foxsports.com.au", "site": "foxsports.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "AFL | AFL Ladder, Live Scores, Results &amp; News | Fox Sports | FOX SPORTS", "title": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father", "title_full": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father | Fox Sports", "published": "2018-03-22T12:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1f9ddd729bf424c6aaae331cdff70758", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 9920, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 723, "comments": 0, "shares": 723}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "913cf68410a75daa8c4db29370e48123ec468295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3XZlrofKWTgcXAxJdKnoibSrpFGj.MZjVBC4b287SEPkUU2TnhWE2dDe1r_xnhd2_ImTaWZ_D6bdEfejc27OMkG_3MmkxS0_pSCKzhuZwwmKRIh8Xih3j6hOeTpm2nVnNs_2Dn4deqo3jg49xzUZomm3EI2OcWpV94pX6GjAVNsrn8va_NhxFqQE.fkTfSUUpm4KS.XQH.DvY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Olle", "published": "2018-03-22T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gary Ablett says return to Geelong made all the sweeter because of his father", "text": "GARY Ablett says his return to Geelong is made all the sweeter by his father\u2019s determination to become more involved with the footy club.

Her brother finally knows why", "text": "By Paul Biegler Updated 24 March 2018 \u2014 12:37am first published 23 March 2018 \u2014 8:00am I found my sister Sian slumped against the chest freezer in the kitchen. The early rays of a hot Melbourne morning were streaming through the French doors and lighting up the mustard fuzz of the carpet tiles. Leunig's poem My Shoe , cut out from The Age , was turning brown on a cloth-covered pin board on the wall, and a Philips portable radio sat on a sideboard, switched off, but tuned to 3LO.\nSian was wearing her black astrakhan coat and Cuban-heeled ankle boots. I was puzzled that she would have fallen asleep there, like that. I put my hand on her shoulder to wake her up but when I touched her it was cold. I still remember my sudden intake of breath; I'd never felt that coldness on a human being.\n\"There's something wrong with Sian,\" was all I could say to Mum when I ran down to her room. When she'd seen my sister for herself, I asked her if Sian, just 18 years old and my only sibling, was dead. Mum's answer came out hesitant, uncertain, as if her mind were prefiguring an enormous bleakness that was still out of conscious reach. \"I think so,\" she said. The shock couldn't quite erase Mum's Welsh lilt, but the sing-song of the valleys got knocked out of her then, pretty much for good.\nPaul Biegler\u2019s sister, Sian, was only 18 when she died.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler It has been 38 years and I don't really want to go back there, but I'm going to because I've got kids, full of life and energy, and I don't want whatever it was that pulled Sian down to creep up on them. Because creep it did. Mum died in 1997 but Dad is still alive, and he says the thing that really sticks is that none of us knew what was going on. I don't want that to be me. And so, after all this time, I've been trying to shine light on a side of my sister that has always been hidden.\nThere was a coroner's inquest and I have the documents, photocopies tinged with sepia. I learnt from the deposition of a 26-year-old woman called Elizabeth that Sian spent her last night on earth in a flat in Brighton Road, St Kilda: \"I saw Sian go on several occasions to the bathroom and I assumed that she was dropping more Tuinal \u2026 Sian appeared to be depressed because her boyfriend had not been in touch with her for a week and she was worried about him.\"\nAdvertisement Tuinal. The capsules look like little red, brown and blue torpedoes, which is kind of apt, considering how many lives they've destroyed. It's a barbiturate, the same thing they squirt into you when you're having an anaesthetic, and was a popular sleeping pill in the 1970s and '80s.\nSian was taking Tuinal, a barbiturate \u2013 \"the same thing they squirt into you when you're having an anaesthetic\".\nPhoto: Getty Images That was until its stats sheet became so awful \u2013 the overdose rate was 20 times higher than for drugs like Valium \u2013 that by the late 1980s, no one could justify prescribing it. The problem with Tuinal was that people would get tolerant to the sleepy euphoria and have to keep upping the dose to get the same kick. But the lethal dose sat stubbornly the same, so the habitual pill-popper, like a fisherman hooking a monster they'd never land, just reeled themselves in, ever closer to goodnight.\nHow do I know all this? I looked it up, sure. But I ended up studying medicine, so I come with professional bona fides, too. In fact, I did advanced training and practised as an emergency physician. It's a job that's all about keeping control in a crisis \u2013 something of a recurring challenge over the years.\nOn the afternoon of February 6, 1980, the day I found my sister, I played golf. I rang up my mate Stephen, who skipped school on that second day of year 12, and we lugged our golf bags down to Elsternwick Golf Club and played nine holes.\nLooking back now it seems bizarre, even callous, but I remind myself that I was 17, and that grief was uncertain, foreign and painful. I didn't know how to do it. The swing of an iron, or a wood, was predictable, familiar. Perhaps there was reassurance from its simple repetition that it would just keep going, and not cut out on me without warning.\nBut, as air always vents to the water's surface, my loss would rise up periodically to remind me of its presence, deep within, mammoth, silent, immovable. At night in bed I'd have sudden moments where I couldn't draw a breath. At school in a maths exam, I excused myself to take a much-needed piss, but when I got to the toilets it wouldn't come. Back in my seat, wound up with a full bladder, I didn't finish the paper.\nPaul Biegler, now at age 55.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler Years later, when I was faithfully recording my dreams for a Jungian analyst, I learnt that Jung himself thought all neuroses are born of illegitimate suffering. I suspect Dr Jung might have seen me as a straggler; I'm 55, and I'm still trying to feel all those feelings properly.\nAnyway, those Tuinals, traded and shared across sticky St Kilda bar tables as \"tuis\", \"chewies\" and \"lollies\", were embedded deep in the drug culture of the time. Prescription drug abuse itself, of course, is timeless. Eighty per cent of overdose deaths examined by the Victorian Coroner in the seven years to 2015 were from prescription drugs, and most of those were drugs in the same classes as Valium and codeine. In 2016, 372 Victorians died of prescription drug overdoses, a hike of more than 25 per cent in six years, and more than double the state's road toll.\nIn the US, opioid overdoses increased 30 per cent in the 14 months to September 2017, according to a report by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. In November, the US President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis called it an epidemic of \"epic proportions\".\nSo the question of why, and how you would know that your own baby-turned-teenager is doing drugs, prescription or otherwise, reaches out across the decades.\nMy first clues in Sian's case come from delving into her innermost thoughts, which would never have reached me in her lifetime, guarded, as they were, in a white wooden box under lock and key. I've carried that box with me, sacrosanct and unopened, for years. Until now. There are bits of rice paper with poems, foolscap sheets with meandering words, unsent letters and hotel meal tickets, among other souvenirs of a short life. It's adolescent, maudlin, threaded with loneliness and the hope of love, hinting at a new relationship here, ebbing away to bleakness and solitude there.\nWhat's unnerving is how this silent stream of desolation flowed hidden under a veneer of normality. And there is also the very conspicuous absence of me, Mum and Dad. Sian's pain is oriented to a world outside the weave of family. We're not a bulwark against loss, we're just missing from the equation, with all hope pinned on the horizon of her peers.\nIn 2017's The MassGeneral Hospital for Children Adolescent Medicine Handbook , three Harvard psychiatrists note the importance of choosing your tribe; friends who do drugs are a major risk factor for substance abuse. Family conflict and a lack of caring adults also figure prominently.\nDid we check any of these boxes? Well, before Mum and Dad split in 1976, there were definitely rows. I do recall the banging of kitchen pots. No violence but, yes, highly audible disharmony. And with my father gone, and my mother tearful and acrimonious over her nightly glass of red, Sian had ample opportunity to slip out her window and into the troubled night.\nElizabeth, Sian's companion on that last night in St Kilda, who deposed so helpfully to the coroner, was forthright on Sian's choice of peer group:\n\"I tried to talk to her about her boyfriend, whom I had known for 10 years, and I tried to tell her that he was an absolute no-hoper and wasn't worth worrying about. Unfortunately Sian was the type of girl who took the unfortunate people of this world under her wing in the vague hope of helping them. She was too kindhearted and sympathetic for her own good.\"\nIn the late '70s, Sian's haunts of choice were the Greyhound Hotel and the Gatwick in St Kilda, the latter home to an erstwhile, and much older, boyfriend whose troubles the white box bears witness to, with scripts for antidepressants and phone numbers for a psych ward.\nBoth institutions, as it happens, were subject to seismic real estate shifts in 2017. The Greyhound, where from all accounts a variety of substances could be bought and sold, was vaporised to make way for apartments, and the Gatwick, a modish private hotel of the art deco era, but latterly home to sundry unfortunates, was sold to Channel Nine to be kitted out for more genteel types on The Block .\nIt would be fair to say Sian's peer milieu fell foul of the Harvard doctors' warnings, with both her preferred public buildings sporting illicit substances in spades. But the Gatwick did not lack caring adults. In July last year, proprietors Rose Banks and Yvette Kelly, who had called the Gatty home since 1971, opened their doors for a day to the public. I heard too late and missed it. But, determined to see where Sian had hung out, I rang photographer Sandy Rogulic, who spent a year among its folk with her camera, snapping the etched faces of hard lives, all with the Gatwick's weathered glory as backdrop.\nOne of Sian\u2019s haunts, St Kilda\u2019s Gatwick boarding house.\nPhoto: Thom Rigney Sandy kindly met me beneath the hotel's iconic portico, and took me on a tour past the dark mahogany of reception, whose windows opened onto flowers like some porthole into Eden, up stately staircases jaded with use, past rooms boarded up to stop squatters availing themselves of the emptiness, down dark corridors and into shared bathrooms studded with 1930s tiles where residents once set off crackers and lit fires on the floor.\nBut the epicentre was a little room, lined with shelves still stacked with the articles of care wielded by Rose and Yvette over all those decades; the towels and linen for their displaced, homeless, drug-affected and abused residents. I had the privilege of meeting both sisters and wondered if Sian ever did, sure that if she had felt their stern but patient embrace, she would have been better for it.\nThings were unravelling for my sister. I come across her school report from year 11. \"This is just not good enough! Sian is skipping classes and leaving school without permission. Unless she conforms she will be asked to leave,\" it reads, ominously. Academic decline is another risk factor on the Harvard doctors' list.\nRecently, the wheels have been turning, ever so creakily, on prevention. The federal government pledged $16 million for a national prescription monitoring system in July, and Victoria passed its anti-doctor-shopping legislation, SafeScript, in October. Codeine-containing drugs became prescription-only last month.\nBut none of this will help if the doctors are dodgy. Sian's GP, who said he didn't know he was referred to as the \"lolly doctor\", had, in the preceding year, prescribed Tuinal to four other young people whose deaths were examined by the coroner. He was investigated by the medical board, struck off for \"infamous conduct\" (nowadays called serious professional misconduct), then reinstated a couple of years later. I saw his obituary in my trawling. He passed away in 2014, at 85. It was peaceful, apparently, after a long illness, and he was a beloved husband and proud father.\nPaul Biegler in 1979 with his mother Beryl, sister Sian and family dog Morgan.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Paul Biegler Sian, of course, who had turned 18 only five months before her death, was never to marry or have a child, turn her nascent love of art, music and poetry into a pastime or career, weather years with the love of family, get smile lines from laughing round the dinner table, or be blessed with the cross-hatched brow of the worried mum. Instead her chair just sits empty at our table. She hovers, in conversation, over the lives of my children. Auntie Sian, spoken of but unseen, never to influence how they grow, or what they think and do.\nPerhaps strangely, it never occurred to me that Sian could have taken her own life on purpose. The coroner was equivocal: \"The evidence adduced does not enable me to say whether such overdose was accidental or otherwise.\" His conundrum still echoes around the nation; in Australia nearly half of the roughly 1400 codeine-related deaths between 2000 and 2013 were accidental.\nHow in hell, though, do you kill yourself by accident? Well, as with Tuinal, people get tolerant to a drug's effects and end up taking too much, or mix it with other drugs and alcohol, or stupidly get behind the wheel. But whether or not Sian's death was intentional, she was, undoubtedly, deeply unhappy, and I guess I'll never really understand why.\nRight at the front of my file on Sian is the autopsy report, which reads:\n7 February 80. Woman. Sian Cathryn BIEGLER. 18 (found dead on \u2026 floor)\nThe body was that of a thin, young woman with a bruise beneath the right side of the chin and a short cut 1cm long. There was no evidence of any deeper damage and the skull and brain all appeared normal. The heart weighed 190g. The myocardium was normal. The coronary arteries showed minimal atheroma \u2026 The mucosa of the stomach was congested and the stomach contained a moderate amount of granular material which was probably ingested tablets \u2026\nThat's what happens when your loved one dies and it's a coroner's case. They become organs, weighed and measured, commented on like specimens in a pathology museum.\nMuch of death shocks and rattles, but coronial deaths mean that on the passage from living, breathing and loving, to nothingness, there is also a clinical carving of flesh, and a resewing for the funeral, all of which reinforces just how little they have become. The stock in trade of the autopsist, valuable as it is, becomes the stuff of nightmares for relatives.\nFor some reason, when my mum received the coroner's documents, it appears she also asked for the photos. I discovered them 20 years ago when I was cleaning out Mum's unit after she died. They were horrible to me then, and I gave them to my dad, who locked them away in his filing cabinet.\nMy dad just turned 80, and it seems I've come of age, because I'm now custodian of the photos. They show Sian on the kitchen floor after the doctor came and rolled her away from the freezer, which is why, because of rigor mortis, her arms are held unnatural, still and upraised, in a pose of helplessness, like those plaster casts of the victims at Pompeii.\nHer hair is spread out from her head on those carpet tiles. Her lips are pinched and colourless. Eyes closed, eyelashes a thin line between the lids. There's no real expression, and if there is it's one of being fed up, exhausted, resigned, over it, goodbye. There is no repose, there is no peace, there is no grateful relinquishing of life's breath. It's just a bad death.\nOne that I'm going to place carefully back in its folder, bury deep within my own filing cabinet, and keep well away from my children, out of harm's way.

(Full disclosure: It\u2019s entirely my fault. Also full disclosure: I am an idiot.)\nLast March, I booked a trip to Miami for me, my wife and our 2-year-old and 4-year-old children without doing even a cursory check of the local calendar. Everybody\u2014except me, apparently\u2014knows that March is Spring Break season. This time of year, you need to use caution in planning a beach getaway\u2014unless you want to spend your family vacation doing Jell-O shots and keg stands, which, I don\u2019t know, maybe you do, you lunatics.\nI learned of my screw-up a few weeks before arrival, when I got an upbeat email from a reservationist announcing that our hotel would be hosting a series of poolside events for the \u201cMiami Winter Music Conference.\u201d\n\u201cThough this is a very exciting time for both our locals and tourists,\u201d the note read, \u201ci t tends to be a more vibrant vibe than our typical tranquil atmosphere.\u201d\nOh dear. I knew what that meant: BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nAs in the throbbing, wordless, molar-rattling, DJ-driven electronic music which forms the soundtrack for a lot of dance party fun for young people who are far cooler than me. I consider myself a reasonably hip adult\u2014I don\u2019t fall asleep on the couch most Saturdays until after 9 p.m.\u2014but I would rather spend a day inside a garbage can being hit with a hammer than endure 10 minutes of BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nThis was a disaster. I wrote back to the hotel, politely asking if there was some alternative situation.\nOK, that\u2019s not true. I threw a hissy fit.\nThe hotel was apologetic and tried to make good. They offered to help us change our dates (not possible, since we\u2019d booked air travel and it was a school vacation week for my wife, a teacher). They offered to move us to another hotel, but that proved difficult, because it was peak season, and besides, every other hotel was having its own BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA bash.\nThen the hotel offered to upgrade our family to a two-bedroom suite.\nA two-bedroom suite? You don\u2019t say. I\u2019d never stayed in a room that nice in my life.\nHow bad could it be? I asked my wife.\n\u201cBad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\nStill, we went. What were we going to do, stay home and freeze in the Arctic? Why not try to tough it out in the fancy suite? Had I gotten so old and cranky that I\u2019d forgotten how to have big, noisy fun? Maybe I would love the dance party.\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, it was tranquil. You could have heard a kitten tiptoe across the lobby. We took the kids to the pool, and they were ecstatic.\nIn a corner, a sound crew worked on a speaker set, but Day One was blissfully quiet. The next day, it began around noon: BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA. It sounded like a jet engine wrestling a jackhammer.\n\u2018 Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action. \u2019\nSoon, the Spring Breakers arrived. First it was a handful, then a truckload. All the BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA didn\u2019t faze them in the slightest. They drank cocktails from plastic cups, floated in the pool, compared sunburns and yelled at each other over the din.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: My kids thought it was fantastic . They couldn\u2019t believe their luck to be at a place like this, with all these people, loud music and tattoos. Someone threw a pile of beach balls into the pool. Free beach balls!\nIt underlined a truth about family vacations: Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action.\nThe Spring Breakers, meanwhile, thought we were hilarious\u2014the pasty parents who had brought preschoolers to a music festival. They chatted up the children, asking them about dinosaurs, animals, french fries. They were really quite sweet. There wasn\u2019t a boorish drunk in the group. It turns out that the Winter Music Conference isn\u2019t totally a Spring Break bacchanal\u2014there\u2019s an international crowd of electronic music connoisseurs who really know their BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA.\nThere\u2019s also this: the Miami BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA\u2013BOMPA world doesn\u2019t do mornings. We had the early hours at the pool to ourselves. The young guests would trickle in around midday, groggily. The party didn\u2019t really get going until late afternoon, and then we\u2019d escape to the beach or go on a bike ride.\nMore Essays from Review\nSpring Break in Miami\u2014With Our Toddlers March 23, 2018 Who Is the Real Atticus Finch?

March 16, 2018 Frankly, it was a fun vacation. And a weird relief. As a parent of toddlers, I\u2019m used to us being the loudest, most objectionable thing in every room we walk into. When we walk into an airplane or restaurant, we\u2019re used to the looks of horror: Please please oh please don\u2019t sit next to me with those horrible kids.\nFor a few days, we were the quiet ones. I loved it almost as much as the cheese plate in the two-bedroom suite.\nNext week, we\u2019re off on another family vacation, to an undisclosed warm location. I\u2019ve made certain that it won\u2019t be the mania of last year. But when we get to the rental car, I\u2019ve got a little something for the stereo and my wife and kids.

His best season came in 2015 when he had 64 receptions for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns in 15 games. \nThe Jaguars rewarded Hurns with a four-year contract extension worth up to $40 million in June 2016. Injuries limited the 26-year-old to 19 games over the past two seasons, leading to Jacksonville releasing him Tuesday. \nB/R NFL 1000 Scouts had Hurns ranked as the No. 33 outside wide receiver for the 2017 season with an overall grade of 65 out of 100:\n\"As the Jags' possession receiver, Hurns is used often over the middle, against zone coverage and on third downs. He's a trustworthy route-runner who catches mostly everything within his reach. He's not going to get deep, but he's a solid contested-catch receiver outside and a physical asset in the slot, especially in the red zone.\" \nHurns' recent injury history is a concern, but his age makes it easy to bet on his potential and returning to the 2015 form that made him a star. \nOffensive playmakers are always in demand, so for the Cowboys to land one at this stage of free agency is a boon to their upside in 2018. \nThe Cowboys have had a quiet offseason to this point. Their biggest move came prior to free agency when DeMarcus Lawrence received the franchise tag. \nAdding Hurns brings a new dimension to Dallas' offense in 2018. Dez Bryant didn't have the same explosiveness last season, averaging a career-low 12.1 yards per reception, and he's only caught 50 percent of the passes thrown in his direction over the past three seasons (150 out of 300). \nHurns gives the Cowboys four wide receivers capable of starting for most teams in the league. He will be lining up alongside Bryant, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley. \nIf Ezekiel Elliott can return to his rookie form, quarterback Dak Prescott will have a wealth of playmakers to spread the ball around to next season. \nThe Cowboys are chasing the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East, so having a powerful offense is a good way to try combating the reigning Super Bowl champions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "allen hurns", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hurns", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jags", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:16:40.119+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be6bb032ae9d587a45564a4e2931ec663f05a3a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZR7C2M3LsRiyKhhGrmNJ4EGixiaqYu1zjTiT.BDN7sd4crE41W0VzyzBiulq0rkMf3iRYZtDDT5_LZiPaKPTIVO26VLszCXn1THABDUQf9bJ57tzt434ZcceFy.e.DYMShNJwxNX69.4Q--", "site_full": "www.cbssports.com", "site": "cbssports.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "title_full": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "published": "2018-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.137, "main_image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2018/03/25/b844164c-becd-48fe-89e3-be024222d593/thumbnail/770x433/456697049162ca12a81dd6dcebcad480/loyola-final-four-kansas-state.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 438, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4296, "comments": 0, "shares": 4296}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be6bb032ae9d587a45564a4e2931ec663f05a3a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS242NJEspr7HOZGqM4ulFSto8NLZgBUZR7C2M3LsRiyKhhGrmNJ4EGixiaqYu1zjTiT.BDN7sd4crE41W0VzyzBiulq0rkMf3iRYZtDDT5_LZiPaKPTIVO26VLszCXn1THABDUQf9bJ57tzt434ZcceFy.e.DYMShNJwxNX69.4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chip Patterson", "published": "2018-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "March Madness 2018: Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella run continues on to the Final Four - CBSSports.com", "text": "14h ago \u2022 4 min read \nATLANTA -- Loyola-Chicago has captured the hearts of college basketball fans everywhere this March, and now it will have a chance to compete for a national championship on the game's biggest stage after beating Kansas State 78-62 to be crowned as champions of the South Region. \nSenior guard Ben Richardson scored a career-high 23 points to lead the Ramblers, who will play Michigan in the Final Four. \n\"Ben sat there and watched Donte [Ingram] and Clayton [Custer] and Marques [Townes] and Dre [Jackson] have big shots,\" head coach Porter Moser told CBS Sports after the game. \"And he comes in there. He is the epitome of character and winning. Just so awesome to see him do that. And that's such a great lesson for so many kids. There was no jealousy or envy, it was about winning and he was ready mentally to step up when it was his time.\" \nArguably the toughest corner of the bracket, the one with the overall No. 1 seed and four conference tournament champions, has been where we've found this year's most unlikely outcomes, from the first-ever 16-over-1 upset to a mid-major from the Missouri Valley Conference making a Final Four run as a No. 11-seed. \nOn the court Loyola packed all of the thrills, beating the third-place team in the ACC (Miami), the SEC regular season co-champions ( Tennessee ) and the Mountain West champions ( Nevada ) by a combined four points. Off the court Loyola introduced the rest of the country to Sister Jean, a kind-hearted and noble face of the NCAA Tournament after a season mostly defined by scandal tied to an ongoing corruption investigation by the FBI. \nLoyola's team fits the model of what so many love about college basketball and this tournament as well. This group doesn't wow you with size or speed when they get off the bus, but the ball moves faster than any player and no one passes the ball better as a team than the Ramblers. There isn't a bad passer on the team, and any one of the rotation players has the potential to to be the team's primary offensive threat on a given night. It's one of the things that makes Loyola so good in the closing moments of these close games: opponents can't turn their attention to any one player because anyone on the floor could potentially be the go-to guy of the moment. \nThe unusual way the region unfolded gave Loyola an Elite Eight foe different from the top seeds that George Mason and VCU had to beat in 2006 and 2011. After beating a No. 6, a No. 3 and a No. 7, the last test was No. 9 Kansas State. The way the game unfolded broke the mold from previous tournament wins as well, with Loyola leading by as many as 21 in the second half and then holding on for the program-defining win in the final minutes. It\u2019s a Cinderella story! For the first time since 1963, Loyola is going to the Final Four! pic.twitter.com/6QUQngjbuM \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 25, 2018 \nWhile Loyola's Final Four run certainly counts as a Cinderella story in the the lore of the tournament, these haven't been massive upsets or a big surprise to anyone who has followed the Ramblers in 2018. Winners in 32 of their 37 games this year, Loyola has been one of the most successful teams in all of college basketball this season. \nNow we all will tune in to see if Loyola can eclipse the accomplishments of George Mason and VCU, the last two mid-major teams to make a run to the Final Four from the 11-line. If there's a reason to think the Ramblers can do it, it's their body of work heading into the NCAA Tournament. George Mason and VCU each got bounced from its conference tournaments, requiring an at-large bid. In the case of George Mason, the NCAA Tournament bid came with national criticism. In the case of VCU we know the Rams were one of the last teams in the field because their path began in the First Four. \nLSU also made the Final Four as a No. 11 seed in 1986. All three No. 11 seeds lost in the national semifinals. \nOne of the things that driven Loyola all season has been a hunger to achieve more. Loyola won a share of the MVC regular season title, but there was a drive among the players to win the crown outright.

Two chances, in fact. \nAccording to a report from the Tuscaloosa News , the two sides are hammering out details for games in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and South Bend, Indiana , although no specific years were mentioned. The report also cited Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne's desire to schedule additional home-and-home series, which would mark a departure from the norm for the program during the Nick Saban era (2007-present). \nDuring that time period, the Crimson Tide have typically participated in Power Five out-of-conference matchups at neutral sites, including: two neutral site games vs. Florida State (2007, 2017), one with Clemson (2008), two with Virginia Tech (2009 and 2013), one with Michigan (2012), one with West Virginia (2014), one vs. Wisconsin (2015) and one against USC (2016). They play Louisville in Orlando to open the 2018 season, Duke in Atlanta in 2019 and Miami in Atlanta in 2021. \nThe only Power Five home-and-home series they've played during the Saban era was at Penn State (home in 2010 and on the road in 2011). Saban also took the Crimson Tide to Duke to finish up a previously-existing deal in 2010 -- one week after hosting the Nittany Lions. \nAs an independent, Notre Dame's schedule is a little more flexible. But due to the partnership with the ACC that includes between four and six games games each year, and rivalries with Stanford and USC, there still is some work to be done to hammer down exactly when these games will be played. \nAssuming it happens, though, the series would be phenomenal for college football . Throw the title game blowout aside, the fact is these are two storied programs that have national championship potential most seasons and don't get together often.

Wayne Huizenga dies at 80", "text": "MIAMI -- H. Wayne Huizenga, a college dropout who built a business empire that included Blockbuster Entertainment, AutoNation and three professional sports franchises, has died. He was 80.\nHuizenga died Thursday night at his home, said Valerie Hinkell, a longtime assistant. She gave no details on a cause of death.\nStarting with a single garbage truck in 1968, Huzienga built Waste Management Inc. into a Fortune 500 company. He purchased independent sanitation engineering companies, and by the time he took the company public in 1972, he had completed the acquisition of 133 small-time haulers. By 1983, Waste Management was the largest waste disposal company in the United States.\nThe business model worked again with Blockbuster Video, which he started in 1985 and built into the leading movie rental chain nine years later. In 1996, he formed AutoNation and built it into a Fortune 500 company.\nHuizenga was founding owner of baseball's Florida Marlins and the NHL Florida Panthers -- expansion teams that played their first games in 1993. He bought the NFL Miami Dolphins and their stadium for $168 million in 1994 from the children of founder Joe Robbie, but had sold all three teams by 2009.\nThe Marlins won the 1997 World Series, and the Panthers reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1996, but Huizenga's beloved Dolphins never reached a Super Bowl while he owned the team.\n\"If I have one disappointment, the disappointment would be that we did not bring a championship home,\" Huizenga said shortly after he sold the Dolphins to New York real estate billionaire Stephen Ross. \"It's something we failed to do.\"\nStephen Ross on the passing of Wayne Huizenga pic.twitter.com/Bg9J1e6Yhy\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) March 23, 2018 Huizenga earned an almost cult-like following among business investors who watched him build Blockbuster Entertainment into the leading video rental chain by snapping up competitors. He cracked Forbes' list of the 100 richest Americans, becoming chairman of Republic Services, one of the nation's top waste management companies, and AutoNation, the nation's largest automotive retailer. In 2013, Forbes estimated his wealth at $2.5 billion.\nFor a time, Huizenga was also a favorite with South Florida sports fans, drawing cheers and autograph seekers in public. The crowd roared when he danced the hokey pokey on the field during an early Marlins game. He went on a spending spree to build a veteran team that won the World Series in the franchise's fifth year.\nBut his popularity plummeted when he ordered the roster dismantled after that season. He was frustrated by poor attendance and his failure to swing a deal for a new ballpark built with taxpayer money.\nMany South Florida fans never forgave him for breaking up the championship team. Huizenga drew boos when introduced at Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino's retirement celebration in 2000, and kept a lower public profile after that.\nIn 2009, Huizenga said he regretted ordering the Marlins' payroll purge.\n\"We lost $34 million the year we won the World Series, and I just said, 'You know what, I'm not going to do that,'\" Huizenga said. \"If I had it to do over again, I'd say, 'OK, we'll go one more year.'\"\nHe sold the Marlins in 1999 to John Henry, and sold the Panthers in 2001, unhappy with rising NHL player salaries and the stock price for the team's public company.\nHuizenga's first sports love was the Dolphins -- he had been a season-ticket holder since their first season in 1966. But he fared better in the NFL as a businessman than as a sports fan.\nHe turned a nifty profit by selling the Dolphins and their stadium for $1.1 billion, nearly seven times what he paid to become sole owner. But he knew the bottom line in the NFL is championships, and his Dolphins perennially came up short.\nHuizenga earned a reputation as a hands-off owner and won raves from many loyal employees, even though he made six coaching changes. He eased Pro Football Hall of Famer Don Shula into retirement in early 1996, and Jimmy Johnson, Dave Wannstedt, interim coach Jim Bates, Nick Saban, Cam Cameron and Tony Sporano followed as coach.\nHarry Wayne Huizenga was born in the Chicago suburbs on Dec. 29, 1937, to a family of garbage haulers. He began his business career in Pompano Beach in 1962, driving a garbage truck from 2 a.m. to noon each day for $500 a month.\nOne customer successfully sued Huizenga, saying that in an argument over a delinquent account, Huizenga injured him by grabbing his testicles -- an allegation Huizenga always denied.\n\"I never did that. The guy was a deputy cop. It was his word against mine, a young kid,\" he told Fortune magazine in 1996.\nHuizenga was a five-time recipient of Financial World magazine's \"CEO of the Year\" award, and was the Ernst & Young \"2005 World Entrepreneur of the Year.\"\nRegarding his business acumen, Huzienga said: \"You just have to be in the right place at the right time. It can only happen in America.\"\nIn 1960, he married Joyce VanderWagon. Together they had two children, Wayne Jr. and Scott. They divorced in 1966. Wayne married his second wife, Marti Goldsby, in 1972. She died in 2017.\nWe mourn the loss of a beloved member of the Dolphins family.\nYour kindness and generosity can be felt throughout South Florida.\nWe will miss you Mr. H. pic.twitter.com/bWrNjbU17q\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) March 23, 2018 Copyright 2018 by The Associated Press.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/bWrNjbU17q", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/977273898071969792", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/977225659838861312", "https://t.co/Bg9J1e6Yhy"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "h. wayne huizenga", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "huizenga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie hinkell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huzienga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "waste management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waste management inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhl florida panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida marlins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "autonation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T00:11:55.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abe149161d9b72d71cc3edc56fb74bb6cee44fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo2O1fWYpUdITlflLgDfpnvrowJmXozvGODFLjwbmm5zvpsn3W7Dn1TNqt7yoCfDDaeWrUepKoubu1acdehvsZTUZOpq1sOf2xPZO__cSeYYOb2XfW5qwZcR4LZBzXv7fxFOGFvthhIOJEjpy9S6ppRuSV8jxCL_jk-", "site_full": "bleacherreport.com", "site": "bleacherreport.com", "site_section": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/feed#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bleacher Report - Front Page", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four", "title_full": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four | Bleacher Report", "published": "2018-03-25T04:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/731/577/hi-res-2c6a3055d0278e9de4eb0d0b175b9509_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1200&amp;q=75", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 506, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3905, "comments": 0, "shares": 3905}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abe149161d9b72d71cc3edc56fb74bb6cee44fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo2O1fWYpUdITlflLgDfpnvrowJmXozvGODFLjwbmm5zvpsn3W7Dn1TNqt7yoCfDDaeWrUepKoubu1acdehvsZTUZOpq1sOf2xPZO__cSeYYOb2XfW5qwZcR4LZBzXv7fxFOGFvthhIOJEjpy9S6ppRuSV8jxCL_jk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Kenyon", "published": "2018-03-25T04:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Loyola-Chicago Earns Place Among All-Time Cinderellas with Trip to Final Four", "text": "Loyola continued its magical run Saturday. Now, the Ramblers are headed to the Final Four. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images The Loyola of Chicago Ramblers arrived at the Big Dance with only a bit of attention. Four victories later, they're guaranteed to leave March Madness as a legendary team.\nThanks to a 78-62 victory over the Kansas State Wildcats, the Ramblers earned a spot in the Final Four and secured their place in men's college basketball history.\nLoyola, the No. 11 seed in the South Regional, joined 1985-86 LSU, 2005-06 George Mason and 2010-11 VCU as the lowest seed to ever reach the national semifinals. That alone is reason enough for the Ramblers to be remembered in the annals of the NCAA tournament.\nBut because of how they kept surviving and advancing, Loyola will be one of the most memorable Cinderella stories.\nOn their way to the Elite Eight, the Ramblers edged sixth-seeded Miami just before the buzzer. They clipped No. 3 seed Tennessee when a jumper rattled home in the closing seconds. They buried No. 7 seed Nevada with a late three.\nBased on margin of victory, this unexpected run is unparalleled in March Madness history.\nOnly 1980-81 Saint Joseph's also won its first three games by a combined four points, per ESPN Stats & Info . But in the Elite Eight, that squad lost by 32 points. Loyola, on the other hand\u2014with a trip to San Antonio at stake\u2014led for the final 36 minutes of Saturday's game.\nThe Ramblers left no doubt they deserved a spot in the Final Four.\nNicole Auerbach @NicoleAuerbach Loyola to the Final Four. And it ain\u2019t even close.\nOne noteworthy point the coming years will determine is whether a specific player will be immortalized. That seems improbable, since Donte Ingram, Clayton Custer and Marques Townes all hit clutch shots and no player has consistently taken over games a la Stephen Curry for 2007-08 Davidson.\nGranted, Sister Jean\u2014the 98-year-old team chaplain whose likeness was featured on a collectible bobblehead \u2014could fill that role.\nStill, it's more likely Loyola will be remembered for its collective success as a scarcely known mid-major program. 2005-06 George Mason and 2010-11 VCU also fit that description.\nReally, that would be the most fitting legacy for Porter Moser's team. For many\u2014if not all\u2014of these players, this will be the glory days story they tell their children and grandchildren.\nCuster paced the Ramblers with 14 points in their opening game. Aundre Jackson's 16 led the way during the second round. Townes notched a team-best 18 in the Sweet 16. Ben Richardson eclipsed his previous season high of 14 by pouring in 23 during the South Regional-clinching victory.\nNCAA March Madness @marchmadness BIG BUCKET from Ben Richardson! \ud83d\udc4c Loyola Chicago stops a 10-0 run by the Wildcats with the SWISH! #MarchMadness #Elite8 https://t.co/Ihc9d0Vh90\nLoyola is team basketball exemplified. And given its coach's path, that shouldn't be a surprise.\nMoser utilizes concepts he learned from his former boss, Rick Majerus. The Ramblers showcase a free-flowing motion offense and a pack-line defense\u2014a similar philosophy to what Virginia was decried for using because it \"led\" to a historic upset in the first round.\nIn the not-too-distant future, the 49-year-old Moser may be fielding calls from power-conference schools. That's a common theme in the history of remarkable tournament runs.\nJim Larranaga\u2014who oversaw George Mason's surge\u2014eventually headed to Miami, and he's guided the Hurricanes to four of the 10 NCAA tournament bids in program history. Shaka Smart made VCU into an annual tourney qualifier prior to leaving for Texas.\nBut no matter whether Moser stays at Loyola for a long time, he'll always be the coach of a legendary Cinderella journey.\nExactly where does this one rank all-time? That question will be debated now and in the future. But that's not as important as one concurrent truth.\nThe glass slipper fit.\nAnd now, Loyola is unforgettable.\n\nStats via Sports Reference and NCAA.com unless otherwise noted.

The Dolphins head coach has played a big part in Osweiler's development during the quarterback's first three years in the league (2012-14). During Osweiler's rookie year in Denver, Gase was the Broncos ' quarterbacks coach. In 2013, Gase was promoted to offensive coordinator, which was his role in Denver until he left to take the same job with the Bears in 2015. \nWith the Dolphins, Osweiler will likely provide insurance for Ryan Tannehill , who has had some trouble staying healthy over the past two years. The Dolphins starting quarterback has suffered a total of two ACL injuries over the past two seasons and it's still unclear when he might be 100 percent. Tannehill has only played in 13 of 32 regular season games over the past two seasons. \nOsweiler is coming to Miami from Denver, where he spent the 2017 season. Although the terms of Osweiler's deal haven't been released, we can probably safely assume the numbers will be nowhere close to the contract he received after leaving Denver following the 2015 season. \nIn March 2016, Osweiler signed a massive four-year, $72 million contract with the Texans that included $37 million in guaranteed money. After an ugly year in Houston, the Texans unloaded Osweiler (and his contract) in a March 2017 trade that sent him to Cleveland.

Credit John Amis/Associated Press ATLANTA \u2014 Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt knew she was going to have to rip up one of the two N.C.A.A tournament brackets she filled out after her beloved Loyola-Chicago Ramblers faced Nevada here Thursday. Before Sister Jean, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain, surged to Kardashian-level fame on social media \u2014 albeit chaste and devout \u2014 she served both as Loyola\u2019s divine inspiration and as a scout who crafted detailed basketball reports that even Mike Krzyzewski would love.\nLoyola\u2019s 69-68 victory over Nevada here on Thursday ensured that Sister Jean would get to rip up the right bracket, which actually was the wrong one. See, the Mother Teresa side of Sister Jean\u2019s personality moved her to slot her beloved Ramblers into the national title game. She called it her Cinderella bracket, and now, after the No. 11-seeded Ramblers upset No. 6 Miami, No. 3 Tennessee and then Nevada, Sister Jean and her dreams are very much alive.\nBut, alas, she could not dismiss the other side of her soul, that of the basketball lifer. So Sister Jean hedged: She filled out another bracket with the Ramblers being eliminated here, in the semifinals of the South Regional.\nIn the first half, the No. 7-seeded Wolf Pack (29-7) looked every bit the powerhouse that had erased a 22-point deficit to stun No. 2-seeded Cincinnati, 75-73, to reach the round of 16. It was a 20-minute chess match punctuated by Loyola fast breaks that were rarely finished. Nevada blocked five of Loyola\u2019s shots, all at point blank range, as the Wolf Pack took a 12-point lead late in the half.\n There was reason, however, for the Wolf Pack to worry even then.\nNevada had struggled to score from long range, shooting just 2 of 13 from beyond the 3-point arc and were 9 of 27 from the field. The Ramblers did not quit, found their scoring touch and put together a 12-0 run to take 28-24 lead into halftime.\nPhoto Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt observing during the first half of Loyola\u2019s victory. Credit David Goldman/Associated Press In the second half, the Wolf Pack doubled down on a smothering defense that forced Loyola into three shot-clock violations and another half-dozen hurried, off-balance attempts. With 3 minutes 18 seconds left, Nevada tied the score at 59-59 when Cody Martin floated through the lane for a soaring layup.\n Now Sister Jean and the Rambler faithful had reason to murmur some prayers.\nAundre Jackson drained a 3-pointer to give Loyola a 62-59 lead with 2:38 left. But with 1:20 left, Martin nailed a 3 of his own to bring Nevada within one, 64-63. But with 41 seconds left, Jackson drew a foul and hit both free throws to put the Ramblers up, 66-63.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

It was just \u2014 that\u2019s something you dream about,\u201d Townes said. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Sweet 16 and you hit a big shot like that. It\u2019s just amazing.

Still, Loyola, ahead by a point, just needed to successfully inbound the ball.\nThey did, and Sister Jean\u2019s Cinderella bracket survived for at least another game.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for Sister Jean, for busting her bracket,\u201d Townes said. \u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re just happy to be in this position and going to the Elite Eight.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marques townes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "loyola-chicago", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mother teresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean dolores schmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike krzyzewski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "loyola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit john amis/associated press atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T05:02:39.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "118df53b03ac8c86e3d5b335c2bfa06ab9b8d9cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bQuofQBLDKhazf7CkjkZDuoQv19Ki0PfVpmWx4QpbIP1ZcQKBtyv3nRJlBG5YwCy0S7MHkWu5BHG0Sor4lcblzAhXmbbTL61uW8BWikJDDpNC4YrXHzKE4QuSnR6c3BHJd.N7QXIBCXi0HXnu7AH", "site_full": "www.miami.com", "site": "miami.com", "site_section": "http://www.miami.com/taxonomy/term/1408/0/feed", "site_categories": ["sailing", "sports"], "section_title": "Miami.com", "title": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "title_full": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "published": "2018-03-22T20:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Coffee_Amelias_MJO_6.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1716, "comments": 2, "shares": 1716}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "118df53b03ac8c86e3d5b335c2bfa06ab9b8d9cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7bQuofQBLDKhazf7CkjkZDuoQv19Ki0PfVpmWx4QpbIP1ZcQKBtyv3nRJlBG5YwCy0S7MHkWu5BHG0Sor4lcblzAhXmbbTL61uW8BWikJDDpNC4YrXHzKE4QuSnR6c3BHJd.N7QXIBCXi0HXnu7AH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carlos Fr\u00edas", "published": "2018-03-22T20:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cuban Coffee 101: Everything to know about ordering coffee in Miami", "text": "READ: No Cuban abuela ? No problem. These are Miami\u2019s best Cuban restaurants \nIf you\u2019re new to Miami or here on vacation, you may have already discovered our devotion to \u201cventanitas,\u201d the ubiquitous walk-up windows where a coffee queen will whip up a cup of jet fuel while calling you cari\u00f1o or mi amor . ( One guy even spent a summer visiting more than 100 of them across Miami .) Gabriela Carbone, 20, a barista at Amelia\u2019s 1931, prepares a cortadito. \nThere\u2019s a right way to order coffee in Miami that won\u2019t earn you a strange look. Locals know there are only four acceptable coffee drinks to order at the ventanita: Cafecito Cafecitos are life. Matias Ocner \nOrder \u201cun cafecito\u201d and la se\u00f1ora at the ventanita will set down a cup and saucer in front of you that looks like it came from a child\u2019s play set. \nDo not be fooled. \nThat ounce-and-a-half or so of Cuban coffee may be a single serving, but it\u2019ll be enough to power you through lunch \u2014 until someone inevitably shows up to work with una colada . (See below). When done right, the cafecito will be sweet but not cloying, covered in a rich, creamy head that\u2019ll stick to your hipster mustache \u2014 and your ribs. Colada A colada is the perfect way to share Cuban coffee with soon-to-be new friends. Matias Ocner/Miami Herald \nAsk for \u201cuna colada\u201d and the ventanita waitress will pour you a four-ounce Styrofoam cup of hot, sweet Cuban coffee \u2014 to go. You may be tempted to peel off the plastic lid and drink it like a Starbucks espresso. \nDo not do this. This is \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d dragonfire. \nThere\u2019s a reason she will hand it to you with a half-dozen corrugated, thimble-sized plastic cups. Bring these back to work after your lunch break, share with five of your closest friends, and you\u2019ll quickly be caught up on office politics. \nPro tip: Pinch the lip of the Styrofoam cup to make a spout that makes the coffee easier to pour. Cortadito Cortadito: when a straight cafecito is just too much Matias Ocner \nFor some people, even locals, it\u2019s just too much to pour the gasoline that is Cuban coffee into an empty stomach. For that, order a cortadito \u2014 a single serving of Cuban coffee \u201ccut\u201d with steamed, whole milk. \nFor a special treat, ask for a cortadito con evaporada and the waitress will substitute milk with sweet, steamed evaporated milk. It makes the perfect finish to a meal in lieu of dessert. Caf\u00e9 con leche Don\u2019t talk to me until I\u2019ve had my caf\u00e9 con leche. Matias Ocner \nMornings in Miami don\u2019t begin until after a caf\u00e9 con leche: a cup of warm, steamed or boiled milk with a shot of Cuban coffee. They may ask you if you want it clarito or oscurito \u2014 light or dark \u2014 depending on how much coffee you want to darken you drink. Feel free to say mediano for Goldilocks perfection. \nDone right, the sugar in the Cuban coffee should be enough to sweeten the caf\u00e9 con leche. (This also applies to the cortadito.) But you can always ask for it sin azucar if you prefer to sweeten it yourself or sub out (gasp!) Splenda.

During the first two years and a half I worked to get the convention signed and ratified. Then the focus shifted to raising the awareness of disability, fighting the stereotypes, social and economic barriers that get in the way of these people and prevent them to lead a decent life and realize their potential. The convention is changing the opinion of people on disability. Through the convention we try to show that people with disabilities have equal rights with us,\u201d Sanaka Samarasinha said. \nThe information strategy on the full inclusion of people with disabilities was developed in Belarus within the framework of the national plan of action to implement the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A journalism contest for the excellence in reporting on disability will be held in Belarus from 20 March to 15 November. \u201cWe would like the contest to provoke more conversations about people with disabilities not only in Minsk but throughout the country. Therefore, we have given a few months to the journalists who will take part in the contest so that they could really get deep into the topic, embrace and understand people's stories,\u201d Sanaka Samarasinha noted. \nHe believes that this contest will also help journalists to cover the inclusion of people with disabilities in a more profound way. \u201cFirst and foremost, the target audience of the contest are the journalists themselves. They often present people with disabilities either as victims who need sympathy or as superheroes who we should admire. While people with disabilities want to be seen as ordinary people. I think that thanks to this contest the journalists will learn how to cover the topic more accurately and deeper,\" he said. \nAccording to the UN resident coordinator, the jury will include representatives of civil society, members of various organizations and people with disabilities. They will select the best entries in three categories: Best Journalistic Story, Best Photo Story, Best Video Story. The prize in each category will correspond to the professional activities of journalists. \u201cBut I think that the most important thing is not a material prize but the platform that will help journalists take their works to the international level: this is a very good opportunity to show their works and tell about the country,\u201d Sanaka Samarasinha said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samarasinha", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sanaka samarasinha", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "minsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:15:37.005+03:00"}], "totalResults": 50, "moreResultsAvailable": 40, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746023686&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3ABY+location%3AMinsk&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 900, "extra": {"place": "Minsk", "country": "BY", "lat": "53.90453979999999", "lng": "27.5615244"}},{"posts": [], "totalResults": 0, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746748554&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AUY+location%3AMontevideo&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 830, "extra": {"place": "Montevideo", "country": "UY", "lat": "-34.9011127", "lng": "-56.16453139999999"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "92ce03474f34a27938f1b39a154de451aef59127", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXEm.9gWlSo06L2Waf0MgRrmP7FjsNDMZEDUBenEj3tnms6Faew2xvm2_q3WrU3R04K96uiBIDCdAfk.cz2mM4ElAMlop3swCWLhMnUMj99Q--", "site_full": "www.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "http://ctvnews.ca/rss/Canada", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CTVNews.ca -

My colleagues are innocent, my son, all these kids are innocent.\"\nBodil Geyer, who organized the march in Vancouver, said hundreds of people showed up despite a fake Facebook event showing the wrong time.\n\"We had a great turnout, all things considered,\" she said.\nGeyer said the real event page was also peppered with pro-gun comments she believed were generated by bots or international users, because the grammar was often incorrect and some messages were threatening.\nWhile the march was largely a show of support for the American gun control movement, Geyer said gang violence in Surrey also makes it a local issue.\nAll of the speakers at the Vancouver event were students, said Geyer, who represents both Democrats Abroad Vancouver and March On Vancouver.\n\"The crowd was amazing, they were awe-inspired, everyone was quite emotional listening to these kids,\" she said.\nTens of thousands of people were expected to attend the march in Washington, D.C., with smaller gatherings to take place in hundreds of cities across the world.\nRallies were also planned in most major Canadian cities, including St. John's, Ottawa and Calgary.\nMelissa Hennig, a survivor of the Oct. 1 mass shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, joined about 150 people for a rally outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton.\n\"While I don't know the ins and outs of assault rifles, I can tell you what it's like to be on the other end of one,\" the Edmonton-area woman told the crowd. She said it's difficult to talk about the \"terror, confusion and panic.\n\"I can tell you something more needs to be done -- something more than thoughts and prayers.\"\nWith files from Ben Singer and Nicole Thompson in Toronto, Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton and Amy Smart in Vancouver \nHundreds out for Ottawa's March for Our Lives rally @ctvottawa pic.twitter.com/dJwlTbUAp0 \n\u2014 Annie BergeronOliver (@AnnieClaireBO) March 24, 2018 McGill student Cyril Yared graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland FL.

When Belisle answered in the negative, Jean Gilles responded that the crime for which he was charged was municipal-related.\nThe four-year term will begin once Jean Gilles' current sentence for assaulting a police officer expires. He is eligible for parole in July in that case.\nBelisle said the dog attack was not a \"one-off incident but rather part of repeated behaviour that has been going on for years.\"\n\"The table was set for a tragedy,\" the judge said. \"The problem wasn't so much if the tragedy would occur but rather when it would happen.\"\nThe conviction carried a maximum 10-year prison term.\nMagdalena Biron said during the trial the attack in a park left her daughter Vanessa with fractures to the cranium and hand, as well as a cheekbone broken in seven places. She still has scars on her face.\nHer partner, Bernard Biron, said at the time Vanessa did not bear any grudges, even though the attack left her unable to eat solid food for months.\n\"She had to go to school with a device connected to her veins because her brain was infected,\" he said. \"Because her skull was crushed in the back and the saliva of the dog infected her system.\"\nIn a brief statement on the last day of his trial, Jean Gilles suggested to Belisle his animal might have been provoked.\nThe judge rejected the claim.\nThe dogs -- another of Jean Gilles' dogs was also at the park that day -- weren't wearing collars the day of the attack and were not on a leash, Belisle said. The accused's property was not adequately fenced in and he didn't have the ability to subdue the animals, the judge added.\nRelated Stories Accused at Quebec pit bull trial tells the court he won't testify Owner of pit bull-type dog found guilty Photos Magdalena Biron and Bernard Biron, whose daughter Vanessa was severely mauled by a pit bull-type dog, leave the courtroom in Longueuil, Que., on Feb. 20, 2018.

The crime took place on March 4 at their Kharghar flat. The accused is a homemaker and her husband a civil contractor. Two of their children\u2014the victim and a 12-year-old son\u2014lived with them in Kharghar while the other two\u2014a 20-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son\u2014resided in their native hometown in Rajasthan. \n\nSenior inspector Dilip Kale said, \u201cThe accused allegedly strangulated her daughter with her dupatta inside their flat around 10.30am on March 4. At 1.45pm, her husband returned home for lunch. When he saw their daughter in the bedroom, his wife told him that she was fast asleep. Then, around 4pm, she called and informed him that their daughter was motionless. He rushed home to find her dead. By around 7pm, their relatives began to gather at their residence and called the police. Since there were strangulation marks on the girl\u2019s neck, we suspected foul play. Initially, we registered an accidental death case but sent her body for post-mortem to the Panvel rural hospital.\u201d \n\nKale further said, \u201cThe victim\u2019s parents took her body to their native place in Rajasthan where they conducted her last rites. Since the post-mortem report revealed the cause of death as choking, we registered a murder case and started a probe.\u201d \n\nCops recorded statements of the girl\u2019s schoolmates, one of whom said the victim had allegedly once told her that her mother had been assaulting her for the past six months as she suspected her of being in a sexual relationship with her father. Her mother had threatened to either kill her or her husband. \n\nThe schoolmates told cops that the girl had allegedly attempted suicide by consuming phenyl in February and had made up her mind to jump from her building\u2019s terrace, saying she was unable to bear the harassment by her mother. \n\nAfter the victim\u2019s parents returned from Rajasthan on Wednesday, they were summoned to the police station where the woman was grilled. She confessed to the crime and said her daughter always answered back and even hit her on being scolded. \u201cWhen the accused beat her up a day after the festival of Holi, the girl retaliated and her mother ended up strangulating her with a dupatta,\u201d said Kale and added that they are exploring the possibility of the father protecting the accused despite learning of the crime. \n\n\u201cWe will probe his role in the crime. As of now, we have registered an FIR under the Indian Penal Code\u2019s Section 302 (punishment for murder) against the accused woman. She was produced before the Panvel magistrate court on Thursday and has been remanded to police custody till March 27.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dilip kale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kharghar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T05:45:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcae70898b95e9e00a2930bda4f40fefd71af4d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBTP0lWRa0PqG9RoFGxFioHkjSWWPIUCo5t4l9Dreocn1hlTr12GIBUvX85IvM4XqUgYfFYUaIa0pzpwdKE.0a1SdwFDcZ_XTRzG8oYvjYman1uM8nguljbbVaFtmYJmYeu_7ZwpRitdqMQr7vJyNb26j2rdo29B_jFLM_c0mtYFw--", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News: India News, Breaking News, Latest Bollywood News, Sports News, Business News &amp; Political News | Times of India", "title": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News", "title_full": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News - Times of India", "published": "2018-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63416936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138621,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5314, "comments": 0, "shares": 5314}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcae70898b95e9e00a2930bda4f40fefd71af4d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBTP0lWRa0PqG9RoFGxFioHkjSWWPIUCo5t4l9Dreocn1hlTr12GIBUvX85IvM4XqUgYfFYUaIa0pzpwdKE.0a1SdwFDcZ_XTRzG8oYvjYman1uM8nguljbbVaFtmYJmYeu_7ZwpRitdqMQr7vJyNb26j2rdo29B_jFLM_c0mtYFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mohammed Shami: BCCI clears Mohammed Shami of match-fixing charges, offers him Grade B contract | Cricket News", "text": "MUMBAI: Indian cricketer Mohammed Shami has got a major boost after he was cleared by the BCCI of match-fixing charges levelled against him by his wife Hasin Jahan, who had claimed that the cricketer had received unaccounted money from a Pakistani woman.\nALSO READ: Highlights of Mohammed Shami's controversy\nWith this development the path has been cleared for his participation with Delhi Daredevils in the IPL starting April 7.

The 80 Olive ridley turtles hatched in the morning and made a dash towards the sea,\u201d said Shah. \u201cEarlier, this beach was very dirty, with piles of plastic trash. No sea turtles were hatching here as garbage is a huge hurdle for them to cross. But now, thanks to the Clean Versova Beach drive, we are all happy and blessed to have seen these newly hatched Olive ridley turtles.\u201d \n\n\nClean-up activists and animal welfare groups together ensured that the little turtles navigated their way into the sea safely, from the hatching site, which was 30-35m from the shoreline. \n\n\n\nAs news of the newly hatched turtles spread, morning walkers and locals thronged the beach to enjoy the experience. \n\n\n\nSocial networking sites, including Twitters, were also abuzz with photographs and videos of the newly hatched turtles. \u201cI have witnessed something surreal today. A life changing experience. 80 Olive Ridley turtles walking back into the sea,\u201d tweeted Shaunak Modi of Marine Life of Mumbai, a group promoting marine life welfare in the city. \n\n\n\nState chief conservator of forests (mangroves cell) N Vasudevan said the department was happy to see the photographs and videos of the turtles on Versova beach. He, however, said: \u201cSome locals, who later went to the beach, informed my department that they could not find any egg shells. I do not know if their doubts are real or not, but if we get any formal intimation on it, I will have to inquire into the matter.\u201d \n\nShah added that a Mumbai-based forest official also came to the beach in the afternoon to do a panchanama after being informed about turtle hatchings. \u201cFor the last few weeks, we had been noticing turtles coming up to the Versova beach and digging into the sand, near Sagar Kutir wadi end. We had also contacted a marine biologist to learn more about it and are today happy that so many turtles hatched,\u201d Shah told TOI. \n\nEnvironmentalist D Stalin said: \u201cThis is a very good development at the cleaned up Versova beach. However, care should be taken that the lights at the beach are made dimmer and the area cordoned off till the nesting period is fully over, as human poachers are a threat for these turtles. Also, bright lights may confuse the young hatchlings.\u201d \n\nThe return of turtles has brought cheer among marine biologists who lament that nearly 80-90% of beaches in Maharashtra have been damaged to such an extent that it becomes unfavourable for Olive ridley turtles to lay their eggs. \n\n\u201cWhile today is certainly a day of celebration since Olive ridley turtles nesting and hatchings have been seen after a very long time period, I cannot help but think of so many other beaches which have been damaged and destroyed due to encroachments and other illegal activities which make it impossible for these sea turtles to step on for their natural nesting,\u201d pointed out Dr Deepak Apte, marine biologist and head of Bombay Natural History Society. \n\nBarely 30- 35 isolated beaches on the Konkan coast are currently hosting their nesting. \u201cThe females lay their eggs above the high tide line, in a sandy shore. How many such sandy shores are really there? Often people illegally steal sand or put up hawking stalls on beaches.\u201d \n\nHe, however, added that it is commendable that consistent efforts by the citizens to clean Versova beach have led to this rare turtle nesting site there.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "afroz shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mumbai news - times of india mumbai", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versova beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "versova", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:59:23.121+03:00"}], "totalResults": 978, "moreResultsAvailable": 968, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746407496&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3AMumbai&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 863, "extra": {"place": "Mumbai", "country": "IN", "lat": "19.0759837", "lng": "72.8776559"}},{"posts": [{"thread": {"uuid": "4d28c3ff1471891049dc39a7ff4bbdeae968ab6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiUR819mLSogEWECZUFwfMIaQbf8TZDlstBMcrWMa2uqEippE5CSPUIXPxspb2_WYeLl5g6l22g4qLa13y0jfq5yFOj9o9X_X4dGiUwJLMYaC_B7R.3olIZxA5BbhPzWNNDjCNSbv8OmX5yi2GbqWECsKMdJlARYORftwGFS1bCF6", "site_full": "www.freelancermap.de", "site": "freelancermap.de", "site_section": "http://www.freelancermap.de/index.php?module=rss&func=projekte", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Projektb\u00f6rse - Deutschland (de)", "title": "German Speaking Front End (.net and Angular JS)", "title_full": "German Speaking Front End (.net and Angular JS)", "published": "2018-03-23T04:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.freelancermap.de/images/social_media/ProjektDesTages.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d28c3ff1471891049dc39a7ff4bbdeae968ab6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiUR819mLSogEWECZUFwfMIaQbf8TZDlstBMcrWMa2uqEippE5CSPUIXPxspb2_WYeLl5g6l22g4qLa13y0jfq5yFOj9o9X_X4dGiUwJLMYaC_B7R.3olIZxA5BbhPzWNNDjCNSbv8OmX5yi2GbqWECsKMdJlARYORftwGFS1bCF6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T04:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Speaking Front End (.net and Angular JS)", "text": "German Speaking Front End (.net and Angular JS) Consultant urgently required for interesting contract in Munich, Germany The Front End (.net and Angular JS) Consultant will ideally have the following skills and expertise: * Strong .net and Angular JS * VB.NET knowledge to take care of Mafiesto tools app * VBA Apply now for immediate interviews!

An exclusive version of the MINI Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 kicks off a long-haul journey from North America to Tierra del Fuego, unveiled at the 2018 New York International Auto Show. MINI Countryman PressClub Africa, DOM, East Europe PressClub Canada PressClub Romania German and English language version available. Photos will follow on March 26th. \nMunich / New York. At the New York International Auto Show (March 30 through April 8, 2018), MINI-style electro mobility will conquer new terrain with the presentation of an exclusive model specially designed for extremely challenging routes. With its underpinnings taken from the brands first plug-in hybrid vehicle, the MINI Countryman Panamericana has been designed for a long-distance tour from North America to Tierra del Fuego, showcasing the power and durability of the brand\u2019s largest model.Additional headlights, tires with emergency running characteristics and a roof rack for transporting a spare wheel will make the compact five-door fit for a road trip in a class of its own. Based on the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 (fuel consumption combined: 2.3 - 2.1 l / 100 km, combined power consumption: 14.0 - 13.2 kWh / 100 km, combined CO2 emissions from fuel: 52 - 49 g / km), the combined power and versatility of its two engines make it the perfect endurance athlete for the Panamericana adventure.Three MINI Countryman Panamericana Plug-In Hybrid vehicles will tackle the intercontinental route on the world's longest north-south road link. They will demonstrate the reliability and long-distance performance of the Plug-In Hybrid drive technology used in the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4.The Plug-In Hybrid drive of the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is an effective contribution to reducing CO2 emissions in road traffic, even beyond urban environments. With a range of up to 40 kilometers, it can reach beyond the city limits and remain fully electric on longer routes. The intelligently coordinated interaction of the electric drive with the combustion engine combines the possibility of local emission-free driving with the freedom of a long range offered by a conventionally powered vehicle.The Panamericana, also known as Pan-American Highway, Ruta Panamericana or Interamericana depending on the region and language, connects the US state of Alaska with the Argentinean Tierra del Fuego and runs between the northernmost and the southernmost point over a distance of about 25,750 kilometers. In both North and South America, numerous intersections and alternative routes are part of the Panamericana road network, covering a total length of more than 48,000 kilometers. In the border area between Panama and Colombia, a ship passage is necessary to continue the journey, as an originally planned section of about 90 kilometers in length, inter alia, to protect the local rainforest area was not completed. The drive over the historic dream road leads through diverse climatic zones, dense jungle and challenging high mountain passes. In addition to well-developed highways, gravel roads and narrow mountain passages are part of the route network that the three MINI Countryman Panamericana Plug-In Hybrids will have to cope with.The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 offers five full-size seats, generous luggage space and numerous comfort features, ensuring an enjoyable drive whatever the terrain. Its two engines generate a combined system output of 165 kW / 224 hp.

The problem: even the most high-end body includes consumable parts that must be renewed from time to time. Ceramic brake discs are some of the most effective yet most expensive consumable parts. The company FOXX Automotive Components from We\u00dfling to the west of Munich has developed a special process that not only matches the performance of the original carbon ceramic brakes , but exceeds it. Rebrake offers an effective process for both types of ceramic brake discs as well as CCB and CCM disks, whereby the brakes\u201c original performance is restored. Put simply, the process restores the extremely robust surface, i.e. the thin top layer on the carbon ceramic brake disc. To ensure that this is achieved, the much thicker core of the ceramic brake disc can be retained to reduce costs compared with completely replacing with a new ceramic brake disc. These can quickly add up to 5,000 to 7,000 EUR or more, depending on manufacturer. \nFrom 1,050 EUR instead of 5,000 EUR for a fully restored ceramic brake disc \nCeramic brake discs come in two different types with different diameters. Rebrake offers a tried and tested resurfacing process for all variants. This restores the special surface of the ceramic brake disc, physically connecting this with the core to form one unit. This is achieved through chemical thermal processes, the most significant being \u201epyrolysis\u201c. At 1,100 degrees Celsius, carbon polymers can be concentrated on the top layer of the ceramic brake disc. \nRebrake: resurfaced ceramic brake discs with a guarantee \nEven if this layer is just a millimetre thick, it\u201cs still very resistant to heat and abrasion. The ceramic brake discs with larger diameters are understandably more expensive to restore than smaller discs. It is somewhat cheaper to resurface CCM discs from Aston Martins, Corvettes, Ferraris, Maseratis, McLarens and Nissans than the CCB brake discs used by Audi, Bentley, BMW, Lamborghini and Porsche. Depending on diameter, prices range from 1,050 EUR to 1,350 EUR plus VAT. Rebrake provides a 12-month guarantee for all resurfaced ceramic brake discs. \nRebrake is the specialists in refurbishing ceramic brakes. The company can used and worn ceramic brakes discs can be refurbished. REBRAKE gives refurbished brake discs the best properties. \nContact", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ccb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxx automotive components", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "we\u00dfling", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T04:19:06.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75a5247ea4591cd935845e27461783d7d72a81a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLwMPjlwq0jSV1ROPWzmAY1PLbmjiMwGnuoB1etQRlmcSaC69kWqm_rUGZ0sODM4dZopBCy6bkpL.bAPgrKQwd0fbBXZMX_sr2pLmofG5.oQ--", "site_full": "www.avitrader.com", "site": "avitrader.com", "site_section": "http://www.avitrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "AviTrader Aviation News", "title": "Around 250,000 flights on new MUC summer timetable", "title_full": "Around 250,000 flights on new MUC summer timetable", "published": "2018-03-22T21:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75a5247ea4591cd935845e27461783d7d72a81a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLwMPjlwq0jSV1ROPWzmAY1PLbmjiMwGnuoB1etQRlmcSaC69kWqm_rUGZ0sODM4dZopBCy6bkpL.bAPgrKQwd0fbBXZMX_sr2pLmofG5.oQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Heike Tamm", "published": "2018-03-22T21:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Around 250,000 flights on new MUC summer timetable", "text": "March 22, 2018 \nThe new Munich Airport summer timetable will start on March 25th: 91 airlines have booked slots for over 250,000 scheduled flights to 246 destinations in 68 countries. In addition to 17 German airports and 179 medium-range routes, scheduled services will be available to 50 intercontinental destinations. The summer period will continue through to Saturday, October 27, 2018. \nThis summer, passengers in Munich will benefit from additions by Lufthansa and its subsidiary, Eurowings, to the range of destinations served. The decision by Lufthansa to station five A380 jets \u2013 currently the world\u2019s largest passenger plane \u2013 at its Munich hub represents a substantial increase in capacity. From the start of the new summer timetable, Lufthansa will offer daily departures with the giant Airbus to the Asian cities of Hong Kong and Beijing and to Los Angeles. Lufthansa is resuming services to Singapore, departing five times a week with modern Airbus A350 aircraft. It is also adding three new weekly flights to Chicago, bringing the total to 10. There will no longer be services to Riyadh and Tehran, however. Along with the new intercontinental services, Lufthansa is making major additions to its European and domestic routes this summer, offering 219 more weekly departures from Munich than in the summer of 2017. \nWith the start of the new timetable, budget airlines will also operate long-haul services in Munich for the first time, with the Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings offering a number of attractive intercontinental connections from the Bavarian capital. The low-cost carrier will operate flights to Bangkok, Cancun, Fort Myers, Las Vegas, Mauritius, Montego Bay, Punta Cana and Puerto Plata, along with Varadero and Windhoek. \nEurowings is expanding its European services, too. With the addition of 20 weekly flights to Palma de Mallorca, it will depart from Munich for the Spanish holiday hotspot 26 times per week. On domestic routes, the budget carrier is adding a total of 100 departures per week to Dortmund, D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg and Cologne/Bonn. In total, Eurowings will offer 140 more flights per week in Munich than in last year\u2019s summer timetable period. \nThe Estonian airline Nordica will fly daily to Groningen in the Netherlands along with its daily service to Tallinn. The new summer timetable also includes the first-ever non-stop flight from Munich to Denmark\u2019s second-biggest city, Aarhus. The service will be offered by SAS.

The Norwegian carrier Wideroe will celebrate its debut in Munich: It will operate three weekly flights with Embraer 190 E2 to Bergen on the south-west coast of Norway. Cyprus Airways is making a comeback in Munich with a weekly flight to the Cypriot port city of Larnaca. Croatia Airlines will serve Dubrovnik on the Adriatic coast five times per week. \nThe Russian cargo airline AirBridgeCargo is doubling its capacity in Munich: With the start of the summer timetable, jumbo freighter service will fly back and forth between Munich and Moscow four times instead of twice a week as before.

The Annual General Meeting is not obliged to follow election proposals. 07 Resolution to authorise the buy-back and utilisation of own shares as well as the option to exclude subscription and pre-emptive rights \nUnless expressly permitted by law, Munich Reinsurance Company requires the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting to buy back shares. As the authorisation granted on 22 April 2009 expires in October 2010, it will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting that the Company be again authorised to buy back own shares. Since the German Act Implementing the Shareholders\u2019 Rights Directive came into force on 1 September 2009, the authorisation may now be granted \u2013 as in the case with authorisations for capital increases \u2013 for a period of up to five years. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management propose that the following resolutions be adopted: a) The Company shall be authorised to buy back shares up to a total amount of 10% of the share capital at the time the resolution is adopted. If at the time this authorisation is first exercised the existing share capital is lower, that amount shall be deemed material. The authorisation may be exercised as a whole or in part amounts, on one or more occasions and for one or more purposes by the Company, but also by dependent Group companies or enterprises in which the Company has a majority shareholding, or by third parties for its or their account. The shares acquired plus other own shares in the possession of the Company or attributable to the Company in accordance with Section 71a ff. of the German Stock Companies Act may at no time amount to more than 10% of the share capital. The authorisation may not be used for trading in own shares. b) The shares shall be acquired at the discretion of the Board of Management aa) via the stock exchange or bb) via a public purchase offer to all shareholders or cc) via a solicitation to all shareholders to submit sales offers (request to sell) or dd) via a public offer to all shareholders to exchange Munich Re shares for shares in another listed company as defined in Section 3 para. 2 of the German Stock Companies Act. In cases bb), cc), and dd), the provisions of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act shall be observed where applicable. aa) If the shares are bought back via the stock exchange, the purchase price (excluding incidental expenses) may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the arithmetic mean of the closing price in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange determined for Company shares with the same securities reference number on the last three days of trading prior to the commitment to purchase. bb) If the shares are bought back via a public purchase offer, the purchase price per share or the upper and lower limits of the price range (excluding incidental expenses) may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the arithmetic mean of the closing price for Company shares with the same securities reference number in the closing auction in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the fifth, fourth and third trading day before the date on which the offer is published. If after a public purchase offer there are significant deviations in the relevant share price, the offer may be adjusted. In this case, the basis for determining the purchase price or the purchase price range will be the arithmetic mean of the closing price for Company shares with the same securities reference number in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the fifth, fourth and third trading day before the public announcement of the adjustment. The volume may be restricted. If the offer is oversubscribed, acceptance shall be based on quotas. For this, the Company may provide for preferred acceptance of small lots of shares (up to 100 shares tendered per shareholder). The purchase offer may provide for further conditions. cc) If the Company publicly solicits submission of offers to sell Munich Reinsurance Company shares, the Company may in its solicitation state a purchase price range within which offers may be submitted. The solicitation may provide for a submission period, terms and conditions, and the possibility of adjusting the purchase price range during the submission period if after publication of the solicitation significant share price fluctuations occur during the submission period. Upon acceptance, the final purchase price shall be determined from all the submitted sales offers. The purchase price (excluding incidental expenses) for each Company share may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the average closing price of Company shares in Xetra trading on the fifth, fourth and third trading day prior to the relevant date. The relevant date shall be the date on which the offers are accepted by the Company. If the number of Company shares offered for sale exceeds the total volume of shares the Company intended to acquire, acceptance shall be based on quotas. Furthermore, the Company may provide for preferred acceptance of small lots of shares (up to 100 shares tendered per shareholder). dd) In the case of a public offer to exchange Munich Re shares for shares in another listed company (\u201cexchange shares\u201d) as defined in Section 3 para. 2 of the German Stock Companies Act, a certain exchange ratio may be specified or also determined by way of an auction procedure. A cash benefit may also be provided for as an additional payment to the exchange offered or as compensation for any fractional amounts. In each of these procedures for the exchange of shares, the exchange price or the applicable upper and lower limits of the price range in the form of one or more exchange shares and calculated fractional amounts, including any cash or fractional amounts (excluding incidental expenses), may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the relevant value of Company shares. The basis for calculating the relevant value of each Company share and of each exchange share shall be the respective arithmetic mean closing price in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the fifth, fourth and third trading day before the date on which the exchange offer is published. If the exchange shares are not traded in the Xetra trading system on the Frankfurt stock exchange, the basis shall be the closing prices quoted on the stock exchange having the highest average trading volume in respect of the exchange shares in the course of the preceding calendar year. If after a public exchange offer there are significant deviations in the relevant share price, the offer may be adjusted. In this case, the basis for the adjustment shall be the arithmetic mean closing price on the fifth, fourth and third trading day before the date of the public announcement of the adjustment. The volume may be restricted. If the exchange offer is oversubscribed, acceptance shall be based on quotas. For this, the Company may provide for preferred acceptance of small lots of shares (up to 100 shares tendered per shareholder). The exchange offer may provide for further conditions. c) The Board of Management shall be empowered to use shares acquired on the basis of the aforementioned or previously granted authorisations or in accordance with Section 71d sentence 5 of the German Stock Companies Act for all legally admissible purposes, and in particular as follows: aa) They may be used for launching the Company\u2019s shares on foreign stock exchanges where they are not yet listed. bb) They may be sold directly or indirectly in return for non-cash payment, in particular as part of offers to third parties in connection with mergers or acquisitions of companies or parts of companies, shareholdings or assets connected with such investments. Selling in this connection may also include the granting of conversion or subscription rights or of warrants and the transferring of shares in conjunction with securities lending. cc) They may be sold to third parties for cash other than via the stock exchange or via an offer to all shareholders. dd) They may be offered for subscription to the holders of conversion rights or warrants issued by the Company or one of its dependent Group companies. ee) They may be offered as employee shares to staff of the Company or of enterprises affiliated with the Company within the meaning of Section 15 ff. of the German Stock Companies Act. ff) They may be retired without a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting being required. Any retirement may be limited to a portion of the bought-back shares. The Board of Management may determine that the shares can also be retired in a simplified process, without reducing the share capital, by adjusting the proportion of the Company\u2019s share capital represented by each of the remaining no-par-value shares. In this case, the Board of Management shall be authorised to adjust the number of no-parvalue shares in the Articles of Association. d) The price at which the shares are launched on other stock exchanges in accordance with item c) aa) or sold in accordance with item c) cc) may not significantly undercut the stock price determined for Company shares with the same securities number in the opening auction in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange (excluding incidental costs) on the day the shares are launched or the binding agreement with the third party is concluded. In addition, in these cases the sum of the shares sold, together with any shares that may be issued or sold during the term of this authorisation by excluding the shareholders\u2019 subscription rights, directly or indirectly pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Stock Companies Act, may not exceed a total of 10% of the share capital, either at the time this authorisation enters into force or when the shares are issued or sold. e) Should the Xetra trading system be replaced by a comparable successor system, the latter shall also take the place of the Xetra trading system for the purposes of this authorisation. f) The authorisations in accordance with item c) may be utilised one or more times, partially or wholly, individually or jointly; the authorisations in accordance with item c) bb), cc), dd) or ee) may also be utilised by dependent Group companies or enterprises in which the Company has a majority shareholding, or utilised for its or their account by third parties. g) Shareholders\u2019 subscription rights in respect of these bought-back shares shall be excluded insofar as the shares are used in accordance with the authorisations in items c) aa), bb), cc), dd) or ee). Beyond this, if bought-back shares are sold via an offer to the shareholders, the Board of Management shall be entitled to exclude shareholders\u2019 subscription rights insofar as this is necessary to grant subscription rights to the bearers of Company or Group company convertible bonds or bonds with warrants to the extent to which such bearers would be entitled as shareholders after exercising their warrants or after the conversion requirements from such bonds have been satisfied. h) The authorisation shall run until 27 April 2015. The authorisation to buy back shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2009 shall be cancelled as from the moment this new authorisation comes into effect. 08 Resolution to authorise the buy-back of own shares using derivatives as well as the option to exclude subscription and pre-emptive rights \nIn addition to the acquisition channels proposed in the authorisation under item 7 of the agenda, the possibility to buy back own shares by using derivatives is also to be provided for. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management therefore propose that the following resolutions be adopted: a) By virtue of the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2010 under item 7 of the agenda, the Company may in accordance with the provisions of items b) to h) buy back own shares also by using derivatives in the form of put options, call options or a combination of both (hereinafter referred to as \u201coptions\u201d). b) Options may be used in one of the ways outlined under aa), bb) or cc) or in a combination of these: aa) Put or call options may be exercised via Eurex Deutschland or LI FFE (or a comparable successor system). In this case, the Company shall inform shareholders of any planned issue or purchase of put or call options by placing a public announcement in the newspapers. Different exercise prices (excluding incidental expenses) on different due dates may be selected for the options, even if the options are being issued or acquired at the same time. bb) The issue of put options, the purchase of call options, or a combination of both as well as their respective fulfilment may also be conducted outside the stock exchanges listed under aa) if the shares to be delivered to the Company on exercise of the options have previously been acquired via the stock exchange at the current share price in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange. cc) The conclusion of put or call option contracts may be publicly offered to all shareholders, or option contracts may be concluded with a bank or a credit institution (hereinafter referred to as \u201cissuing undertaking\u201d) in accordance with Section 53 para. 1 sentence 1 or Section 53b para. 1 sentence 1 or para. 7 of the German Banking Act, subject to the obligation to offer these options to all shareholders for subscription. The Company may only buy back the options outlined under items aa) to cc) in order to retire them. c) In the case of item b) aa) and bb), the exercise price of the options (excluding incidental expenses) per share may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the price determined for Company shares with the same securities number in the opening auction in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the day the option contract is concluded. If own shares are bought back using options, the acquisition price (excluding incidental expenses) payable by the Company for the shares corresponds to the exercise price agreed on in the option. The acquisition price (excluding incidental expenses) paid by the Company for options may not lie above, nor the sale price (excluding incidental expenses) collected by the Company for options below, the theoretical market value of the respective option determined according to recognised principles of financial mathematics, the calculation of such market value considering among other things the agreed exercise price. d) In the case of item b) cc), the exercise price of the options (excluding incidental expenses) per share may not exceed by more than 10% or undercut by more than 20% the arithmetic mean of the closing price determined for Company shares with the same securities number in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the fifth, fourth and third trading day prior to publication of the offer. In the event that the offer to shareholders is oversubscribed, allocation shall be based on quotas. The Company may provide for a preferred offer for concluding option contracts or a preferred allocation of options for small lots of shares (options up to 100 shares per shareholder). e) The term of the options shall be a maximum of 18 months in each case and be so determined that exercising options to acquire shares will be completed by 27 April 2015 at the latest. The Company may use options to acquire own shares up to a maximum of 5% of the share capital at the time the resolution is adopted at the Annual General Meeting. If at the time this authorisation is first exercised the existing share capital is lower, that amount shall be deemed material. f) If options are used to buy back own shares, taking due account of item b) aa) or bb), shareholders shall not have a claim to conclude such option contracts with the Company, in line with the provisions of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Stock Companies Act. Shareholders shall also not have the right to conclude option contracts to the extent that, on conclusion of option contracts pursuant to item b) cc), the Company has provided for a preferred offer or preferred allocation for the conclusion of option contracts with regard to small lots of shares. Shareholders shall have a right to offer their shares to the Company only insofar as the Company is obligated to purchase shares from them pursuant to the option contracts. g) Should the Xetra trading system be replaced by a comparable successor system, the latter shall also take the place of the Xetra trading system for the purposes of this authorisation. h) In all other respects, the conditions and uses of the authorisation granted under item 7 of the agenda shall apply. 09 Resolution to authorise the issue of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants with the option of excluding subscription rights; to cancel Contingent Capital Increase 2005; to create a new contingent capital (Contingent Capital Increase 2010); and to make the relevant amendment to the Articles of Association \nThe authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2005 concerning the issue of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants was limited to a period of five years and expires on 27 April 2010. The authorisation is to be renewed so that this instrument is available to the Company in the coming years if needed. As no convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants were issued under the authorisation granted in 2005, the existing contingent capital increase is no longer needed for safeguarding them and should be replaced by a new Contingent Capital Increase 2010. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management propose that the following resolutions be adopted: a) Cancellation of Contingent Capital Increase 2005 The authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2005 regarding Contingent Capital Increase 2005 of \u20ac100m shall be cancelled. b) Authorisation aa) Period of authorisation, nominal amount, maturity period, number of shares The Board of Management shall be authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants (referred to in the following as \u201cbonds\u201d) on one or more occasions up to 27 A pril 2015 for a maximum nominal amount of \u20ac3bn with or without a limited maturity period and to grant the creditors of such bonds conversion or exercise rights in respect of shares issued by the Company up to a maximum amount of \u20ac117m of the share capital, in accordance with the respective bond or warrant conditions. Bonds may also be issued against non-cash payment insofar as the value of the non-cash payment accords with the issue price and the latter does not significantly undercut the bonds\u2019 market value determined in accordance with item bb) (3) of this resolution. The bonds may be denominated in the legal currency of another OEC D country as well as in euros, provided the equivalent amounts to those stated above in euros are not exceeded. They may also be issued by dependent Group companies or enterprises in which the Company has a majority shareholding; in this case, the Board of Management shall be authorised to guarantee the bonds on behalf of the Company and to grant the creditors of such bonds conversion or exercise rights on the Company\u2019s shares. bb) Subscription right, exclusion of subscription right Shareholders shall generally be granted a right to subscribe for the bonds. The bonds may also be underwritten by one or more banks subject to the obligation that they offer these to the shareholders for subscription. However, the Board of Management shall be authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the shareholders\u2019 subscription rights in the following cases: (1) insofar as it is necessary in respect of fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio; (2) insofar as it is necessary to grant the bearers of warrants or conversion rights in respect of shares of the Company, or creditors of convertible bonds with conversion requirements, pre-emptive rights to subscribe for new shares to the extent to which they would be entitled as shareholders after exercising these rights or after the conversion requirements of such bonds have been satisfied; (3) insofar as the bonds are issued against cash and the issue price is not significantly below the bonds\u2019 theoretical market value determined according to recognised principles of financial mathematics. However, this authorisation to exclude subscription rights shall apply only to the extent that the shares issued to cover the related conversion rights and/ or warrants do not represent more than 10% of the share capital, either with respect to the date on which the authorisation becomes effective or the date on which such authorisation is exercised. This restriction shall also include own shares insofar as they are sold within the term of this authorisation by excluding subscription rights pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Stock Companies Act. Furthermore, this restriction shall also include shares that are issued within the term of this authorisation from capital authorised for the purpose by excluding subscription rights pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Stock Companies Act. (4) insofar as bonds are to be issued against non-cash payment, and the exclusion of subscription rights, especially in the context of company mergers or in connection with the acquisition of companies or participations, is in the interests of the Company. Together with shares issued against non-cash payment on the basis of Authorised Capital Increase 2009 by excluding subscription rights and pursuant to Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Stock Companies Act, the shares issued overall on the basis of this authorisation by excluding shareholder subscription rights may not exceed 20% of the existing share capital at the time this authorisation comes into force or \u2013 if this value is lower \u2013 when the authorisation is first exercised. cc) Conversion right, conversion requirement In the event of the issue of bonds with conversion rights, the creditors may exchange their bonds into Company shares in accordance with the bond conditions. The proportional amount of share capital represented by the shares to be issued as a result of the conversion may not exceed the nominal amount of the convertible bond. The exchange ratio is determined by dividing the nominal amount of one convertible bond by the conversion price fixed for obtaining one Company share. The exchange ratio may also be determined by dividing a convertible bond issue price that lies below the nominal amount by the fixed conversion price for obtaining one Company share. The exchange ratio may be rounded up or down to a whole figure; in addition, a supplementary cash payment may be specified. Furthermore, the conditions may provide for fractional amounts to be combined and/or compensated for in cash. The bond conditions may also provide for a variable exchange ratio; they may additionally provide for a conversion requirement. In this case, the Company shall be entitled in the terms and conditions of the bonds to compensate fully or partially in cash any difference between the nominal amount of the convertible bonds and the result obtained from multiplying a market price for the shares at the time of the mandatory exchange \u2013 such price to be more closely defined in the terms and conditions of the convertible bonds, but to be at least 80% of the share price relevant for the lower conversion price limit pursuant to ee) below \u2013 and the exchange ratio. dd) Warrants In the event of a warrants issue, one or more warrants shall be attached to each bond which entitle the bearer to subscribe for Company shares in accordance with the warrant conditions. The proportional amount of the share capital to be subscribed for per bond may not exceed the nominal value of the bond. ee) Exercise or conversion price, protection against dilution The exercise or conversion price fixed in each case for one share must be at least 80% of the mean closing price of Company shares in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the ten trading days prior to the day the final decision is taken by the Board of Management to submit an offer to subscribe for bonds and/ or to declare acceptance on the part of the Company following a public invitation to tender such offers. In the case of subscription rights trading, the relevant days are those on which the subscription rights are traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange, with the exception of the last two days of subscription rights trading on the stock exchange. Notwithstanding Section 9 para. 1 of the German Stock Companies Act, the conditions of the convertible bonds or bonds with warrants may contain a clause safeguarding against the dilution of stock for the event that during the conversion or exercise period the Company, whilst granting its shareholders pre-emptive rights, either increases its capital or issues further convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, or issues other warrants, and does not grant the holders of conversion rights and/or warrants subscription rights to the extent to which they would have been entitled after exercising the conversion or exercise rights or after the conversion requirements from such bonds have been satisfied. The terms and conditions may also provide for the conversion rights and/or warrants to be adjusted in the case of other measures of the Company that might lead to a dilution in the value of the conversion rights and/or warrants. The proportional amount of the share capital to be subscribed for per bond may on no account exceed the nominal value of the bond. ff) Other possible structures Subject to compliance with the above conditions, the Board of Management shall be authorised to determine all further details of the issue, terms and conditions of the bonds or to establish these in agreement with the executive bodies of the Group companies issuing the bonds, particularly the interest rate, issue price, maturity period and denomination, agreement of subordination compared with other liabilities, subscription or conversion ratio (e.g. a variable conversion ratio depending on the performance of the share price during the term or a conversion ratio based on a bond issue price lower than the nominal value), fixing of an additional cash payment, compensation for or combination of fractional amounts, the amount of the exercise or conversion price (e.g. also whether the price is to be fixed when the bonds are issued or whether it should be set within a given range to be established subject to future stock exchange prices), and the exercise or conversion period. The conditions may also stipulate whether the Company\u2019s own shares, payment of the equivalent value in cash, or shares in other listed companies may be offered instead of fulfilment by way of the contingent capital increase and, in the case of mandatory convertible bonds, how details of the performance, terms and fixing of the exercise or conversion price are to be determined. c) Contingent capital increase There shall be a contingent increase in the share capital by up to \u20ac117m to be retired through the issue of new registered no-par-value shares entitled to dividend from the beginning of the financial year in which they are issued (Contingent Capital Increase 2010). This contingent capital increase is for granting shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants issued by the Company or by a dependent Group company up to 27 A pril 2015 under the aforementioned authorisation of 28 April 2010, insofar as the issue is against cash payment. The new shares shall be issued at the exercise and conversion price fixed in accordance with the criteria of the aforementioned authorisation. The increase in the share capital shall be carried out only to the extent that warrants or conversion rights from the bonds are exercised or conversion obligations from such bonds are satisfied. The Board of Management shall be authorised to decide on the further details of the contingent capital increase. d) Amendment to the Articles of Association Article 4 para. 3 of the Articles of Association shall be reworded as follows: \u201c(3) A contingent increase in the share capital by a further amount of up to 117 million euros, consisting of new registered no-par-value shares entitled to dividend from the beginning of the financial year in which they are issued, has been authorised. This contingent capital increase is for granting shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants issued by the Company or by a dependent Group company up to 27 April 2015 under the authorisation of the General Meeting of 28 April 2010, insofar as the issue is against cash payment. The increase in the share capital shall be carried out only to the extent that warrants or conversion rights from the bonds are exercised or conversion requirements from such bonds are satisfied. The Board of Management shall be authorised to decide on the further details of the contingent capital increase (Contingent Capital Increase 2010).\u201d 10 Resolution to amend Articles 6 (registration for the Annual General Meeting) and 7 (exercise of voting rights by proxies) of the Articles of Association \nThe German Act Implementing the Shareholders\u2019 Rights Directive entered into force on 1 September 2009. This new law has occasioned amendments to the German Stock Companies Act, including the regime of time limits prior to the Annual General Meeting and regulations governing the exercise of voting rights by proxies. The Articles of Association are to be amended to conform to the new regulations. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management propose that the following resolutions be adopted: a) Article 6 para. 2 of the Articles of Association shall be reworded as follows and para. 4 deleted:\u201c(2) In order to participate in the General Meeting and exercise their voting rights, shareholders shall register in good time for the General Meeting and have their shares entered in the register of shareholders by the stipulated deadline. Applications shall be submitted to the Company at the address given in the invitation, at the latest on the last day of the statutory deadline for registration. In the invitation to the General Meeting, the Board of Management may stipulate a shorter deadline for registration, measured in days.\u201d b) Article 7 para. 3 of the Articles of Association shall be reworded as follows:\u201c(3) Voting rights may be exercised by proxy. Granting of proxies, their revocation and proof of authorisation vis-\u00e0-vis the Company shall be submitted in writing. The Board of Management shall announce details of the procedure in the invitation to the General Meeting, and in doing so determine a relaxation of some of the formal requirements.\u201d 11 Resolution to amend Article 6 of the Articles of Association (information for shareholders) \nThe German Act Implementing the Shareholders\u2019 Rights Directives has also modernised the rules governing how shareholders are invited to the Annual General Meeting. It allows restricting the transmission of notifications to shareholders to purely electronic means in accordance with Sections 125 and 128 para. 1 of the German Stock Companies Act, which is considerably cheaper, more efficient and environmentally friendly than the time-consuming and laborious mailing of material on paper. Use is to be made of this option, at least for some of the communications. Instead of the detailed long version of the agenda, the motions for resolution, requests for supplementary motions and information in accordance with Section 125 para. 1 sentence 5 of the German Stock Companies Act, we wish in future to mail our shareholders a simplified short version of the items on the agenda and proposed motions together with the invitation letter and the registration form for the Annual General Meeting. The long version of these documents will be posted on the internet and in future would be transmitted only in electronic form unless shareholders specifically request to have this information in paper form. In that case, shareholders would be sent the full long version as in the past. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management propose that the following resolutions be adopted: In Article 6 of the Articles of Association, the following para. 4 shall be added:\u201c(4) The transmission of notifications in accordance with Section 125 para. 2 and Section 128 para. 1 sentence 1 of the German Stock Companies Act in respect of the agenda, requests for supplementary motions and information in accordance with Section 125 para. 1 sentence 5 of the German Stock Companies Act shall be restricted to electronic means. The same shall apply to motions for resolution. The Company shall comply with requests from shareholders to have these documents sent on paper.\u201d Link", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "supervisory board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munich reinsurance company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00fcnchener r\u00fcckversicherungs-gesellschaft aktiengesellschaft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00fcnchen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T04:46:09.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c2fd5a77a77eef1e9dfe2b81097a1e7491528e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9syxFpO1CnFohNXxfIHQ4b.5QXq_vTnHdAbhk7W8FU90d8kNTSg9cUBqTtecKqZYFml5hSW.iPyLXcXV4E2qvBaMrzN2zs7TUnTjISHR07rc5d4va_5vBa", "site_full": "www.webnewswire.com", "site": "webnewswire.com", "site_section": "http://www.webnewswire.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Webnewswire", "title": "How can ceramic brake discs be cheaply resurfaced?", "title_full": "How can ceramic brake discs be cheaply resurfaced?", "published": "2018-03-24T02:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.webnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/340285.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c2fd5a77a77eef1e9dfe2b81097a1e7491528e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9syxFpO1CnFohNXxfIHQ4b.5QXq_vTnHdAbhk7W8FU90d8kNTSg9cUBqTtecKqZYFml5hSW.iPyLXcXV4E2qvBaMrzN2zs7TUnTjISHR07rc5d4va_5vBa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "editor", "published": "2018-03-24T02:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "How can ceramic brake discs be cheaply resurfaced?", "text": "by editor How can ceramic brake discs be cheaply resurfaced? \nHigh-tech materials are standard in high HP sports cars. The problem: even the most high-end body includes consumable parts that must be renewed from time to time. Ceramic brake (http://www.rebrake.de/?lang=en) discs are some of the most effective yet most expensive consumable parts. The company FOXX Automotive Components from We\u00dfling to the west of Munich has developed a special process that not only matches the performance of the original carbon ceramic brakes (http://www.rebrake.de/how-can-ceramic-brake-discs-be-cheaply-resurfaced/?lang=en), but exceeds it. Rebrake offers an effective process for both types of ceramic brake discs as well as CCB and CCM disks, whereby the brakes\u201d original performance is restored. Put simply, the process restores the extremely robust surface, i.e. the thin top layer on the carbon ceramic brake disc. To ensure that this is achieved, the much thicker core of the ceramic brake disc can be retained to reduce costs compared with completely replacing with a new ceramic brake disc. These can quickly add up to 5,000 to 7,000 EUR or more, depending on manufacturer. \nFrom 1,050 EUR instead of 5,000 EUR for a fully restored ceramic brake disc \nCeramic brake discs come in two different types with different diameters. Rebrake offers a tried and tested resurfacing process for all variants. This restores the special surface of the ceramic brake disc, physically connecting this with the core to form one unit. This is achieved through chemical thermal processes, the most significant being \u201cpyrolysis\u201d. At 1,100 degrees Celsius, carbon polymers can be concentrated on the top layer of the ceramic brake disc. \nRebrake: resurfaced ceramic brake discs with a guarantee \nEven if this layer is just a millimetre thick, it\u201ds still very resistant to heat and abrasion. The ceramic brake discs with larger diameters are understandably more expensive to restore than smaller discs. It is somewhat cheaper to resurface CCM discs from Aston Martins, Corvettes, Ferraris, Maseratis, McLarens and Nissans than the CCB brake discs used by Audi, Bentley, BMW, Lamborghini and Porsche. Depending on diameter, prices range from 1,050 EUR to 1,350 EUR plus VAT. Rebrake provides a 12-month guarantee for all resurfaced ceramic brake discs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ccb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxx automotive components", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "we\u00dfling", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T05:16:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "749939d5d97e8bdb6eaf8045ff697b81f46a92ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2yxJ34ChK1QQH2U9N4Or2xITgyGrZpKe3rGsQbo5R.J.YMaz2wnQIiy1f.nXQL.M-", "site_full": "supernova.eso.org", "site": "eso.org", "site_section": "http://portaltotheuniverse.org//rss/news/featured/", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "PTTU Featured News", "title": "Your Events in the ESO Supernova Planetarium & Visitor Centre", "title_full": "Your Events in the ESO Supernova Planetarium & Visitor Centre", "published": "2018-03-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://supernova.eso.org", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63407, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "749939d5d97e8bdb6eaf8045ff697b81f46a92ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2yxJ34ChK1QQH2U9N4Or2xITgyGrZpKe3rGsQbo5R.J.YMaz2wnQIiy1f.nXQL.M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ESO Supernova", "published": "2018-03-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Your Events in the ESO Supernova Planetarium & Visitor Centre", "text": "Your Events in the ESO Supernova Planetarium & Visitor Centre Events brochure now online 23 March 2018 \nThe ESO Supernova Planetarium & Visitor Centre offers unique venue alternatives for event organisers in Munich.

Oman has been providing rapid molecular testing for those suspected with TB, which coincides with the World Tuberculosis Day, which is observed on March 24 every year. On this day in 1882, Dr Robert Koch announced he had discovered the bacterium that causes TB, paving the way for diagnosing/ treating of the disease. The theme of this year\u2019s Tuberculosis Day, \u2018Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world\u2019, focuses on building commitment to end TB at all levels, governmental and community. The day provides an opportunity to shine the spotlight on the disease, and its prevention and treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers TB, besides HIV/AIDS, as the main causes of death due to communicable diseases. Globally, an estimated 10.4 million people fell ill with TB in 2016, of which 1.8 million died. According to WHO, Oman is a \u2018low incidence country\u2019 with less than 10/100,000 population (5.8/100,000 in 2017) with TB, with an average reduction rate of two per cent in the last ten years. In order to reduce its incidence and mortality, Oman has developed a strategy for TB elimination by 2050, which is being implemented in phases.

It will involve review of job descriptions and the terms of reference of the administrative divisions of the Council, thereby ensuring complementarity in functioning and avoid duplication. In course of honouring the Committee members, he said that the Council\u2019s interest in the Organisational Evaluation process was based on the conviction that it is important to find precise Key Indicators to measure the performance of the staff in order to achieve the desired objectives. The report, documented by the Organisational Evaluation Committee of the Council, will lead to the establishment of the vision and mission for formulating requisite proposals for the development of the Council\u2019s KPI process. He affirmed that an organisational performance evaluation is an integrated and systematic process for obtaining valid information about the performance of individuals within their departments and the performance of these departments within the overall policies of the Council and their impact on the overall performance of the Council. He expressed his satisfaction over the process of evaluation of staff, department and organisational performance, which sought to refine the standards of achievement in the light of the objectives envisaged, ensuring the efficient and effective use of resources to achieve those objectives. He was pleased to see that the Council\u2019s Evaluation Committee had worked to formulate a vision for the Council to consolidate the shura, which was rooted in the values and culture of society, keeping abreast of the developments enabled by changing times and supporting the development path. The panel recommendations would be utilised and applied to help develop the work of the Council during the next phase.

[Photo by Elvis Ogina/Standard] \nThe Government has scrapped age and term limits for chief executive officers of State corporations. \nThe directive means that the CEOs can be re-appointed as many times as the appointing authority deems fit and work beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. \nThe removal of term limits is contained in a circular issued by Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua dated February 27, 2018, and titled \u2018Terms of Service for State Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officers\u2019. \nUnder the current regime, depending on the relevant Act creating the corporations, CEOs serve for a between three and five years and are eligible for re-appointment for a second term depending on their performance. The law also requires that the executives retire upon attaining 60 years. \nMr Kinyua\u2019s circular has overturned this requirements. \n\u201cThe Government has noted lack of clarity on terms of service for chief executive officers of state corporations and concerns at service period, which in some instance has led to litigation,\u201d Kinyua\u2019s circular copied to all Cabinet secretaries, the Attorney General, and all principal secretaries. Avoid fake news! Subscribe to the Standard SMS service and receive factual, verified breaking news as it happens. Text the word 'NEWS' to 22840 \nThe circular states that the terms of service for CEOs are contractual and renewable based in performance and business requirements, and that they are not subject to the general public service policy on mandatory retirement at 60 or 65 years or limit as to the number of terms served. \n\u201cThe Circular No. OP. CAB.2/7A of March 20, 2009 on review of mandatory retirement age for public servants is therefore, not applicable to State corporations\u2019 chief executive officers,\u201d wrote Kinyua, referring to the policy that raised retirement age from 55 to 60 years. \nState corporations \n\u201cYou are required to bring the contents of this circular to the boards of directors of State corporations under your docket and to ensure they have put in place a robust mechanism for ensuring performance of CEOs and leadership requirements over time,\u201d Kinyua states. \nIt is not clear if the new directive supersedes section 80 of the Public Commission Act that bars public officers from serving beyond the 60-year age limit. \nWeed out officials \nThe section states: \u201c A public officer shall retire from the service with effect from the date of attaining the mandatory retirement age; and the commission or other appointing authority shall not extend the service of such retired public officer beyond the mandatory retirement age.\u201d \nAccording to the 2013 report of the Presidential Task Force on Parastatal Reforms, there are 257 State corporations in the country. \nThe report proposed mergers of State firms for efficiency but it has never been implemented. It stipulated that for the retained agencies no new contract of service shall be offered to a CEO who has served in the same State agency for two terms. \nThe proposal was designed to weed out entrenched officials and promote accountability. \nThe report proposed that the CEOs of retained agencies be allowed to serve their unexpired terms subject to performance and fully meeting the requirements for appointment or be allowed to serve the unexpired term up to a maximum period of six months. \nThe push to have the top civil servants serve beyond retirement age is likely to influence contract terms and succession plans for top State executive officers. It also adds to concerns about the ageing public service workforce and obstacles to succession management. \nData from the December, 2016 payroll revealed that 35 per cent of national government employees are aged between 51 and 60 years while 53 per cent are above 46 years. \nMajority of employees in management positions are over 46. \nCourt case \nThe decision to exclude CEOs from retirement age caps comes at a time when the Government is battling to retain Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner General John Njiraini, whose term has expired. \nThe KRA boss attained the age of 60 on December 19 last year while his second and final term expired on February 3 this year. \nA case has been filed in court to have him replaced. \nCentral Bank of Kenya Deputy Governor Sheila M\u2019Mbijjewe, who attained the official retirement age on Mach 6 this year, is still in office. \nCBK Governor Patrick Njoroge has said that his deputy would serve her full contract, which runs to mid next year. \nIn November 2016, Industrial Court Judge Nelson Abuodha issued orders stopping Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter from renewing then Kenya Power CEO Ben Chumo\u2019s term, ruling that he had reached the retirement age of 60. \nThe ruling also saw the then director general of the Energy Regulatory Commission, Joe Ng\u2019ang\u2019a, leave eight months before his contract expired. He was 61.

According to organisers, the students' event sold out in 30 minutes. Today (Friday), he is scheduled to attend several international media interviews, including a morning slot on BBC. Dr Miguna, who has dismissed the newfound love and unity deal between President Kenyatta and National Super Alliance (Nasa) leader Raila Odinga , says he will carry on with his resistance movement. \u201cThe #NRMKe isn't \"isolated\" by the \"handshake\u201d, he said on Twitter. \u201cThe #NRMKe is not involved. We are not going to solve intractable societal ills through handshakes. We are going to do so through structural changes in governance.\u201d Kenya\u2019s governance and leadership case, he said, is a choice between the \u201crule of law or despotism.\u201d Upon his arrival at the Heathrow Airport Terminal 2, he was received by members of Nasa UK team, led by chairman George Osore. RETURN Dr Miguna is one of the Nasa leaders who paid the steepest price of 'swearing-in' Mr Odinga as the 'people\u2019s president' at Uhuru Park, Nairobi, on January 30. He was arrested, locked up incommunicado, moved from one police station to the other and deported despite a High Court order barring the same. The High Court on February 26 ordered his return to Kenya and suspended Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang\u2019i\u2019s declaration that Dr Miguna is a prohibited immigrant. Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita further suspended the cancellation of Dr Miguna\u2019s passport by the immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa. He ordered the Immigration Department to facilitate Dr Miguna\u2019s return from Canada, including arranging for his visa. The judge, at the same time, put on hold Dr Matiang\u2019i\u2019s gazette notice declaring the NRM, a wing of Nasa, a criminal gang. Judge Mwita ruled that Dr Miguna's rights were violated by his deportation. The Court of Appeal rejected government request to temporarily stop the High Court orders. The case is ongoing. The barrister, who practises in Canada, said he would land in Nairobi on March 26. \"The despots will fall, and they will fall starting March 26th when I arrive in Kenya. The Lunga Lunga dance for liberation will take place,\" Dr Miguna told the Nation at Heathrow. Additional report by Gabriel Otach in London.

By ROSE ODENGO \n\u201cMake yourselves indispensable,\u201d Viona Ojiambo\u2019s father would often tell her and her siblings. These words have been a lifelong guide to excellence for the 30-year-old mathematician. Viona grew up in Kahawa West, Nairobi County. Her father was a mathematics teacher at Nairobi Technical Training Institute, then a secondary school called Technical High school in Nairobi. Her father\u2019s life began humbly as a fisherman. He had experienced the power of hard work and self-drive, and instilled these qualities in Viona and her five siblings, besides taking keen interest in their academic performance. Mathematics for Viona came naturally, a factor she attributes to her father. To her, a mathematical equation was an exciting journey of discovery. \u201cMany people see big equations as complicated, but I ask myself, what is the secret behind it and how can I create a big equation like this?\u201d She says. Viona does admit that she struggled with languages in school, which affected her overall grades. Observing this, her parents encouraged her to focus on what she was good at, which was math, to improve her overall school grades, support Viona is grateful for. On graduation from Pangani Girls High School in 2005, she joined Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) where she pursued an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, graduating in 2011. She gives credit to Dr Duncan Kioi and Prof Matthew Kinyanjui, both mathematics lecturers who encouraged her to pursue her specialisation further with a Masters in Science in Applied Science at the same university, graduating in 2015. As Viona pursued her Master\u2019s Degree, she began to offer support to some of her lecturers, instructing classes, it was then that she fell in love with teaching. Now, just as her lecturers inspired her, she is offering the same inspiration to the next generation of mathematicians, instructing undergraduates in mathematics at JKUAT. An average working day for her starts at 4am or 5am and ends between 5am and 6pm, when she calls it a day and heads home to spend time with her three children. \u201cI believe in utilising the day hours well. Your brain can\u2019t function when you\u2019re tired, you need to rest,\u201d she emphasises. Her day is split between research, preparing for classes, instructing, marking assignments and setting exams, like most in academia. Viona also builds on her new research on her PhD, made possible through a scholarship from the Pan African University Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI). Her thesis is on the mathematical modeling of silica growth in geothermal pipes, in a field known as fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is the study in Physics of forces and flow within fluids such as liquids, gases and plasma (such as in human blood). For example, before buildings or drainage are constructed, a mathematician should develop a simulation of the flow of water, sewage and other gases or fluids from the building prior to construction. This provides the engineer with perfect dimensions for the pipes he needs for a building\u2019s drainage to avoid damage or even collapse of buildings due to leakage or cracks from pressure or corrosion. Viona\u2019s research explores the understanding of a common problem in geothermal pipes that causes corrosion, affects the efficiency of the geothermal pipes and in return increases the cost of maintenance of these pipes. Her research aims to find a way of resolving this problem by better understanding the cause of the silica growth. What is the difference between Pure and Applied Mathematics? Pure mathematics is the theory of mathematics. Ideally, it is explaining math in English form to understand the general concepts of the science of math. Applied mathematics, as the name suggests, you apply your knowledge of math to various disciplines such as medicine, physics and engineering, to come up with a specified solution. Many are convinced math is hard. How can we change this perception? The approach teachers take makes it very abstract. The best way to make mathematics exciting is to make it more practical. For example, X means cars or Y means the cost of labour. When you place these on a graph and make the derivative more relatable, the concepts are easier to grasp. What does one need to build a career in applied mathematics? You need an undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and explore an area of specialty in other scientific fields such as physics and medicine. How can we get more girls to build a career in Applied Mathematics? There are more girls enrolling now. People used to call JKUAT - Juja boys because the ratio of men to women was very high, but this is changing. Now in my average class of 180 students, women make up 40-50 per cent of the class. I believe the more we talk about and share stories of women in these fields the more we will encourage more women. What other careers can one pursue with a degree or Master\u2019s in Applied Mathematics? You need to place yourself in another discipline so that you can apply your mathematics in that discipline. For example, if interested in mathematical modeling of diseases, you can study a short course in epidemiology, the branch of medicine which deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health. With your bachelors of science in applied mathematics, you will be able create solutions in this field. You can apply this in medicine, physics, engineering, computer science, statistics, actuarial science, chemistry and psychology. What is the average income of a professor in Applied mathematics? It is an average of Sh100, 000 to Sh120, 000 net monthly, but this can go higher based on tenure, experience and qualifications. What is your advice to young girls interested in building careers in STEM? Be committed, focused and dedicated to achieving and realising your dreams. There is always room for you out there, and at the top. The best of you is on the way, so put more effort, more input, resilience and believe in yourself and your dream and seek the brighter part of life in all things.

[Photo by Edward Kiplimo/Standard] \nNational Super Alliance (NASA) leader Raila Odinga's attempt to get senators to rescind their decision to remove Moses Wetang'ula as Senate minority leader has failed, yet again. \nAfter two hours of deliberations, Raila, who met 20 senators from the Opposition alliance in Nairobi yesterday, only managed to convince the lawmakers to convene a retreat within a fortnight. \nALSO READ: Raila, senators face off over Wetang'ula \nRaila had convened a crisis meeting just two days after the senators formally removed Mr Wetang\u2019ula and replaced him with Siaya's James Orengo. \nWetang\u2019ula, the Ford Kenya party leader, and Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, attended the meeting where, according to sources, the Opposition legislators stuck to their guns. \nAmani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi stayed away, with allies saying he did not want to join a meeting that would not yield any fruit. \n\u201cDuring the meeting, it emerged there were weighty matters that have to be deliberated and we have resolved that the senators will hold a retreat and report to the (NASA) summit within two weeks,\u201d Raila told journalists at the Panafric Hotel.   \nAsked if that meant that Mr Orengo's election stands, Raila and Kalonzo said an appropriate answer would be available after two weeks. \nHowever, three senators told The Standard separately that Wetang'ula's fate was sealed and not even the retreat could save him. \n\u201cWe just told our party boss that senators consciously made their decision to remove him and that has been done; there will be no reversal,\u201d one legislator said. \nThis was the first meeting the NASA summit was holding with senators following the ouster that threatens to break up the coalition. \nALSO READ: Raila futile bid to save Wetang\u2019ula \n\u201cWe have agreed as NASA that the unity of the coalition is important. All the principals are united, including our colleague Mudavadi, who had a board meeting hence his missing this meeting,\u201d Kalonzo said. \nWetang'ula's removal leaves NASA on the brink given that the three parties - Wiper, Ford-K and ANC - have complained about \"harassment\" by ODM. \nA similar attempt to save Wetang\u2019ula was thwarted by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, who rejected a letter from NASA Chief Executive Norman Magaya on grounds that it did not meet the threshold of Standing Orders. \nMr Lusaka proceeded to accept a letter from Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jr communicating the decision to elect Orengo as the new Leader of Minority. \nOn Tuesday, Kalonzo requested Orengo to decline the appointment \"so that he doesn't go down as the person who collapsed NASA\u201d.

Boniface Okerosi Misera and Cephas Kamande Mwaura will first serve a mandatory two-year jail term then pay the fine, the anti-corruption court ruled in Nairobi. FINE But if they do not pay the fine, they will serve an additional one year, the court ruled. Chief Magistrate Felix Kombo fined Mr Misera Sh40 million for fraudulently pocketing Sh10 million. The court slapped Mr Mwaura with Sh37.2 million fine for earning Sh9.3 million belonging to the defunct Nairobi City Council. The jailed men were part of a group of four city council officials and outsiders charged in the infamous Sh283 million cemetery land scandal that hit plans to acquire new burial grounds. The court convicted them after dismissing their defence that they did not play any role in the land scam . SCANDAL They were found to have doctored land transfer documents and earned from the scam illegally. The court fined them three times what they had acquired in accordance with the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. The cost of the land, which was located in Machakos County, was also found to have been inflated and did not meet the requirement of the land that the council needed for a graveyard. The court also agreed with witnesses who testified that the two were at the centre of the scandal. The court ruled that the prosecution proved the case to the required standards. In the cemetery fraud , public funds were used to buy 120 acres in Mavoko Township, which experts considered unsuitable for a graveyard. Taxpayers lost nearly Sh160 million in the scam.

DEL Det var knyttet stor spenning til kampen. Tidligere LSK-trener Monica Knudsen har tatt over V\u00e5lerenga, mens flere tidligere Lillestr\u00f8m-spillere ogs\u00e5 har byttet ut gult med bl\u00e5tt. L\u00f8rdag var gjestene klart best og s\u00f8rget for at samtlige som er glad i Lillestr\u00f8m fikk en over gjennomsnittet god l\u00f8rdag. Hege Riises lag ga seg ikke f\u00f8r det sto 5-0, og det siste m\u00e5let kan fort st\u00e5 igjen som sesongens scoring n\u00e5r det skal telles opp til slutt. Guro Reiten dro med seg ballen over midtstreken etter 71 minutter, og hun s\u00e5 da at V\u00e5lerenga-keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela sto langt ute. LSKs nummer 10 dro til, og ballen forsvant i en bue over Korpela og dalte ned i den finske burvokterens venstre hj\u00f8rne. F\u00f8r det hadde Ingrid Engen gitt gjestene ledelsen etter fem minutter. I det 51. minutt doblet Sophie Roman Haug til 2\u20130 da hun p\u00e5 vakkert vis headet inn et str\u00f8kent innlegg av Synne Skinnes Hansen. LSK-laget la p\u00e5 til 3-0 etter 61 minutter etter vakkert angrepsspill. Ingrid Moe Wold fant Reiten inne i feltet, og p\u00e5 vakkert vis satte hun inn scoringen. Kun minutter senere ga oppskriften Skinnes Hansen/Haug scoring igjen. F\u00f8rstnevnte svingte inn et perfekt innlegg, og Haug kunne sette skotuppen til og juble for sin andre nettkjenning for kvelden. Ydmykelsen ble total for V\u00e5lerenga med Marte Berget fra Gran p\u00e5 laget da Reiten scoret fra midtbanen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ingrid moe wold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korpela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katrine buer s\u00f8nden\u00e5", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guro reiten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tinja-riikka korpela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "v\u00e5lerenga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terje pedersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terje av", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hege riises", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica knudsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ntb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "v\u00e5lerenga", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T22:25:16.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cca9db7494837b71b33e0154d226e275ab7f64c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83o2p0_l8sJvq3OJOC8pzEu.yUSzq4Qvv1NDVrFugw.g3BcZV81KckwlhC2e7ZfNPLAu_X.kUAQ1D6RrYPRPdz5GXx2oDDnzS1y3ZEVXe9zQ--", "site_full": "www.tradewindsnews.com", "site": "tradewindsnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.tradewindsnews.com/rss2/casualties/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.tradewindsnews.com", "title": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "title_full": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/article1458947.ece5/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_600/34bcdba050f873b6138470138f5715ca", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cca9db7494837b71b33e0154d226e275ab7f64c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83o2p0_l8sJvq3OJOC8pzEu.yUSzq4Qvv1NDVrFugw.g3BcZV81KckwlhC2e7ZfNPLAu_X.kUAQ1D6RrYPRPdz5GXx2oDDnzS1y3ZEVXe9zQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gary Dixon", "published": "2018-03-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing", "text": "EMAS refinancing hinges on Oslo listing Singapore OSV owner's new investor wants continued presence in Norway. \nThe restructuring of heavily indebted Singapore OSV owner EMAS Offshore is contingent on its retaining its primary Oslo listing, it has revealed. \nThe company is continuing to work together with its advisers, creditors and key bank lenders to ensure a vital refinancing. \nWhite knight BTI, a subsidiary of BakerTechnology, is looking to invest up to $50m in the company in return for a majority stake under a term sheet signed in early December. \nOn 15 March, the company received an improved restructuring plan from BTI, it said, without giving further details. \nThe plan requires the continued listing of the company\u2019s shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange on terms that are acceptable to BTI. \nDelisting coming? \nThis could be a problem, however, as the Oslo bourse is on course to delist the company on 27 April. \nEMAS can continue to make representations to the exchange in the meantime, after an initial appeal failed this week. \nThe bourse has previously said EMAS was \u201cnot in a position to comply with its financial reporting obligations\u201d. \nEMAS said: \"The group will work closely with its investors, principal bank lenders and other stakeholders to bring to fruition the restructuring plan in the near future.\" \nIts principal bank lenders had indicated support for the refinancing plan in February. \nHuge loss last year \nThe company also revealed a loss of $705.66m for 2017. This compares to a deficit of $535.24m the year before. \nRevenue dipped to $136.48m from $167.57m, as it continued to be negatively impacted by the weak market environment, resulting in low utilisation and charter rates. \n\"Other expenses\" were $475.52m, mainly related to impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, a loss on the disposal of a subsidiary and provisions for onerous contracts. \nThe comparative figure last year was $378.1m. EMAS Offshore wins bank support for restructuring \nTotal liabilities increased by 8% to $1.125bn as at 31 August 2017. \n\"The market environment in the offshore oil and gas industry is expected to remain challenging,\" it said. \n\"Oil prices have not reached an extent that will result in a significant increase in activities in the offshore oil and gas sector while the situation of over-supply of offshore vessels continues to persist.\" Subscribe to read this story. \nWant to try TradeWinds? \nEssential shipping news \nKeep up-to-date with all the latest news, breaking stories and marketing-leading analysis with a TradeWinds subscription \nWe use cookies on tradewindsnews.com for analysis, customizing content and advertising, and to develop our products and services.

The decision is reported by state broadcaster NRK to have come as a surprise to both Solberg and Progress Party leader Siv Jensen. \n\u201cI appreciate that Siv and the entire [Progress] party were prepared to prepared to set aside our position as a government partner to support me as justice minister. But I cannot allow my departure to result in the Progress Party losing power and influence,\u201d Listhaug wrote in a statement, which was also posted on her Facebook page. \nShe is reported to have given no indication on Monday to government or Progress Party leadership of her intention to resign. \n\u201cIt was entirely up to me whether to see this through to the end or to step down,\u201d she wrote. \nThe minister's resignation is the culmination of political and public outcry over an image and message posted by Listhaug on Facebook. \nIn the March 9th social media post , which contained a photo of al-Shabaab militants, she accused Labour of considering that \"the rights of terrorists are more important than the security of the nation\". \nShe was criticising Labour's opposition to a proposal to strip the citizenship of Norwegians who pose a threat to the nation's vital interests, without a court order. \nLabour members were the main victims of the deadliest attacks on Norwegian soil since the Second World War when, on July 22nd, 2011, Anders Breivik, who once was a member of the Progress Party, killed 77 people in twin attacks: one targeting then Labour prime minister Jens Stoltenberg's office in Oslo and another against a Labour youth camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. \nIn the message confirming her resignation, the minister wrote that her post \u201cwas nothing to do with July 22nd\u201d and claimed the subsequent outrage was a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. \n\u201cI have found this to be nothing but a witch-hunt, in which Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re\u2019s intention was to connect freedom of speech to an issue which is one of the most important things we must discuss for Norway\u2019s future,\u201d she wrote. \n\u201cThe most important thing for me is the Progress Party and that it will continue to govern Norway,\u201d she said at a press conference Tuesday according to NRK \u2019s report. \nShe also reiterated her criticism at Tuesday\u2019s press meeting of St\u00f8re for connecting her Facebook post to the July 22nd attacks. \n\u201cThe aim of the [2017] election campaign was to keep Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re away from the Prime Minister\u2019s office, and that is still my goal. I don\u2019t think he is suitable for the role of Prime Minister of Norway. I am happy that Siv [Jensen] and the rest of the party have supported me 100 percent. They were willing to see this through,\u201d she said. \n\u201cSt\u00f8re has tried to label me, compare me with the views of Norway\u2019s worst mass murderer. I strongly reject that,\u201d she said. \nListhaug confirmed that she will continue as an MP and \u201cconcentrate one hundred percent on promoting Progress\u2019 politics with my excellent parliamentary colleagues.\u201d \nListhaug\u2019s decision comes after the Christian Democrats on Monday refused to back her over the controversial Facebook post. \nAlthough Listhaug eventually removed the post and apologised in parliament, a motion of no confidence against her gained the support of all parties in Norway's opposition, leaving her fate as justice minister potentially in the hands of the one remaining non-coalition party, the centre-right Christian Democrats. \nBoth Labour and the Centre Party are reported to have decided to move against Listhaug after seeing the way the apology was made. \nShe was asked for an apology on eight occasions and came to the speaker's stand four times during the session on Thursday last week. \nThe Facebook post announcing her resignation was published at 8am on Tuesday, just two hours before the no confidence motion was set to be voted in parliament. \nAfter a long meeting Monday, the Christian Democrats concluded that they no longer could support Listhaug as justice minister, furthering the possibility of the government crisis, although they did not give a final confirmation as to how they would vote on the no-confidence motion. \nThe party\u2019s votes would have determined whether the motion gained a majority. \nOn Monday evening, the three government parties \u2013 the Progress Party, Solberg\u2019s Conservatives and the Liberal party \u2013 held crisis talks at the prime minister\u2019s residence. Neither Solberg nor Jensen are thought to have asked Listhaug to step down, NRK reports. \nAt Tuesday\u2019s press conference, she called the Christian Democrats a party \u201cwithout a backbone, leadership or a way forward\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sylvi listhaug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "listhaug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erna solberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h\u00e5kon mosvold larsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonas gahr st\u00f8re", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "progress party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:01:02.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bff86e8037399bf049cf213b9f0b4a962d234b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRD_rXh3623.zLuFLTjYu3PrTG6Ycl3FEJOfCNsxOZkGITPB8oehEHoooq_pq0PXQo-", "site_full": "www.civita.no", "site": "civita.no", "site_section": "http://www.civita.no/feed/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Civita", "title": "Women in charge", "title_full": "Women in charge", "published": "2018-03-23T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://scontent.fosl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/28423942_10155572794258335_5944463219808929379_o.jpg?oh=1cc00c25257ac9c53f7f711637dc6d9f&#038;oe=5B4E7908", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bff86e8037399bf049cf213b9f0b4a962d234b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRD_rXh3623.zLuFLTjYu3PrTG6Ycl3FEJOfCNsxOZkGITPB8oehEHoooq_pq0PXQo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anne Siri", "published": "2018-03-23T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Women in charge", "text": "The Nobel Peace Center and Civita invited to an event Thursday March 22nd 18.00\u201419.30. \n\nCivita and the Oslo Women\u2019s Rights initiative invited to a meeting with women\u2019s rights activists from Libya, Iran and Jordan at the Nobel Peace Center.

She specializes in security politics, global order and opposition to liberal values, focusing in particular on Russia and the US. 21/03/2018 \nOn Sunday 18 March, Russians head to the polls. Several events in Oslo discuss Putin\u2019s victory. It is usually a bad testament to a regime\u2019s democratic character if such events can be planned in advance. \nYet, Putin is unquestionably popular. Although the opposition is limited in its room for maneuver, Russia is not a totalitarian regime, as some have argued. The election is nevertheless neither free nor fair. \nThis poses a challenging question: On what basis do we evaluate Russia? \nIn the 1990s, there was an expectation that Russia would become like \u201cus\u201d. Thus, we apply a different standard to Russia than for example China. Russia is close and similar enough to be compared to our own political praxis, yet also different enough to be kept outside the idea of what constitutes \u2018Europe\u2019. We criticize China, but far more cautiously. \nWhen Putin first came to power in the autumn of 1999, he gave a speech in which he argued that while Russia was European, it shouln\u2019t be measured by the same standards as liberal democracies. Since then, the regime has increasingly emphasized its distinctly conservative character, in particular from Putin\u2019s third presidential period in 2012 and onwards. In parallel, the regime has intensified its criticism of Western international politics. It is today easy to forget that Russian authorities were once open to join both the EU and NATO. \nFor many of us working on Russian foreign and security policy, it has been a point to nuance some of the criticism levied against our eastern neighbor with reference to what the world looks like from the Kremlin. The annexation of the Crimea in 2014 was, for instance, a clear violation of international law, but hardly a sign of a new, nationalist and/or expansionist imperialism. The Crimea holds a very special role in Russian identity and cannot be compared to for example the Baltic states, as some have done in various threat assessments. \nThe Russian threat has, at times, been presented as disproportionally large. This unfortunately also catalyzes negative reactions from the Russian side, not unlike the ones that come when people feel that they are being unfairly treated. \nBreakups rarely happen overnight or out of the blue. Western authorities have generally been dismissive of constructive input from Russia, as in relation to the war in Libya. Their criticism of Western military interventions is shared by many academics, but when the criticism is coming from Russia, it is interpreted as polemics. \nLast Tuesday, the independent UN Commission for Syria published a report detailing civilian casualties. \nThe report concludes that both Russian and American air strikes are the cause of mass civilian deaths. A Russian attack in November 2017 killed at least 84 people, an American attack in March 2017 at least 150 people. Both countries should be criticized heavily. Nevertheless, the criticism against Russia is far more visible in the media, which they can unfortunately use to undermine it. \nFrom a Russian point of view, the authorities are tired of being evaluated according to standards to which their critics do not adhere. Russia correctly points to the double standards applied to Western versus Russian behavior, such as in the US cooperation with Saudi Arabia. If we are to criticize someone morally in international politics, we should do so on principles that are clear and apply to everyone on an equal basis. As a result of the inconsistency in who and what many governments choose to criticize, Russian authorities can more easily and reject otherwise legitimate criticism. \nCriticizing Russia for interfering in US elections while tacitly looking the other way when the US meddles in other countries\u2019 elections and regimes raises tough questions. The US-based researcher Dov Levin has investigated election interference by the US and the Soviet Union/Russia during the period 1946-2000. Levin counts at least 81 interferences by the US, 36 by Russia. After 2000, the USA has interfered in elections such as in Kenya (2013), Lebanon (2009) and Afghanistan (2009). \nHe defines election interference as \u201ca costly act which is designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one of the two sides\u201d. \nIs the action itself good as long as the intent is \u2018good\u2019, and is the intent good as long as we consider the actor to be good? Some seem to argue that American interferences are legitimate due to the liberal foundation on which they are based, despite the occasionally very negative outcomes, such as in Iraq and Libya. The attempt to remove president Karzai from power in Afghanistan in 2009 was, on the other hand, primarily about US self-interests, not a larger moral good. \nDuring the past few years, Norwegian media have also jumped to rash and unfounded conclusions about Russian behavior. \nThe debate about Storskog in the autumn of 2015 is a clear example. As researchers Lars Rowe and Arild Moe have successfully argued, the accusation that Russian authorities controlled the flow of refugees \u2013 as a form of hybrid war \u2013 was unfounded. We should keep that debate in mind when we choose to judge Russia for a negative action which it may have had the motivation to do, but without any evidence to substantiate our claims. \nAs the enemy image has grown stronger, less documentation is apparently required to accuse Russia of transgressions. It does not mean that Russia, for example, is not behind the poisoning of the former spy Sergej Skripal and his daughter in England, but a potential motive cannot automatically be equated with guilt. \nThat said, the authorities aren\u2019t making it any easier for those of us who want to nuance the image of Russian politics. \nRussia is currently ranked 148 th out of 180 countries on the Reporters without Borders\u2019 annual index of press freedom. Critical journalists are risking their lives. If freedom of speech is a political and/or moral priority, we should be able to criticize. The same goes for the systematic stigmatization of gays, lesbians and other who do not fit into the hetero-normative family idealization. \nThe regime is moving in an increasingly conservative and authoritarian direction, on par with countries like Turkey. \nThere is, nevertheless, another important side of Russian foreign policy: the border cooperation. This year, we are celebrating 25 years of the Barents Cooperation. In 2017, the number of border resident cross-border journeys increased by 25.5 percent. Marit Jacobsen of the Barents Secretariat stated that this traffic \u201cshows that people want to be in touch with their neighbors and are curious about each other\u201d. \nOur neighbor is perceived differently in the north than in Oslo, where the image of Russia is more tightly linked to the regime and Putin. That is also why the arrest of Frode Berg, a driving force behind the people-to-people cooperation, was all the more disappointing. \nI have had the pleasure of spending parts of my childhood in Russia, and many journeys and stays in the years after.

One of the others, Issa ( Sorosh Sadat ), quickly replies \u2018I hope it wasn\u2019t Muslims who did it, or all hell will break loose\u2019. \nThis is why it the film\u2019s focus, in its closing titles, on the terrorist\u2019s goals, ideology and notion of an enemy is both crucial and correct; without it, the atrocities could not be contextualized. It is also important that other pick up where this film leaves off. * To see or not to see 18 February 2018 Now This: Emma Gonzalez (activist/survivor of the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School 14 February 2018): \u00abI know it is hard to watch those videos, and some people are saying \u00abhow dare they post something like that\u00bb. No, if we had to live through it you should have to live through it too, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take for you to understand what it feels like then watch the freakin video.\u00bb \nSeeing this film, thinking about it, and writing about it, has been difficult, and it has affected me for days. This film is not for everyone , but I think it is for many more than many think. \n\u2018Do we need to see this?\u2019 or \u2018What good will making a film do?\u2019, are of course pertinent questions. But, above all, it is important to remember that not everyone has their own memories of 22 July. Those who today embark on their teens were young children when this happened, and the narratives we create now are both for those who still remember and those who were not yet born. For the youth of today, as for many others, reaching for the books of \u00c5sne Seierstad, Aage Storm Borchgrevink ( A Norwegian Tragedy: Anders Behring Breivik and the Massacre on Ut\u00f8ya , 2012) or Kjetil Stormark ( Da terroren rammet Norge: 189 minutter som rystet verden /\u00abWhen Terrorism Struck Norway, 189 Minutes that Shocked the World\u00bb, 2012) to understand may not be the obvious choice. \nWhile choosing whether or not to see the film is up to the individual, it does come with challenges not so easily avoided. The media attention surrounding this film, and the other films soon to come (Reconstructing Ut\u00f8ya [Carl Jav\u00e9r] will appear in cinemas this autumn; Norway [ Paul Greengrass ] is to be released on Netflix around the same time; Sara Johnsen and P\u00e5l Sletaune s television series will premiere on NRK in 2019) can be difficult for survivors and loved ones, and is not something one can opt out of. \nI often defend film as a medium from those who see a contradiction between film and art, or think film can only ever be entertainment. We are so used to encountering killers, violence and gunfire as part of entertainment products, that the notion of a film about mass murder being something other than that might seem alien. Sitting down in a full theatre, where others in the audience had brought popcorn and sweets, to see this film, was thus disconcerting. \nPerhaps we have become more desensitized to violence. The latest crime fiction about serial killers, or the latest school massacre on the news, might pass us by without leaving much of a trace or spurring much reflection. But maybe film as a medium, and a film such as this specifically, can help combat our insensitivity, as Indiewire film critic David Ehrlich claims in a piece linking Poppes film to American school shootings. That was my sense, at least, as I, along with everybody else in a full theatre, sat quiet and motionless until all of the end credits, and the final notes of Wolfgang Plagge s moving soundtrack, were gone. \nCinema has qualities and characteristics that make unique experiences possible, and as such, film can offer different kinds of explorations of these incidents of terrorism than literature, music, or other visual arts can. When people hesitate to approach Ut\u00f8ya as a filmic experience, it is particularly in fear of encountering images they wish not to see, or have attempted to avoid creating for themselves. But the film does not visualise violence nearly as much as one might fear, and I am not the only one to express relief that it is less painful to watch than expected. Many of the young people who were there on that day did not witness violence directly; they saw paths, rocks, bushes, and other frightened and desperate kids. The facts described in the verdict from the 22 July trial is far, far more brutal than this film. \nAs a fact-based fiction film, U \u2013 July 22 supplements the information offered by the verdict, the reports, the non-fiction prose and the news media. Not even \u00c5sne Seierstad\u2019s literary approach and multi-faceted perspective provided the intensity Poppe and his team have achieved in their rendering of what the kids on the island experienced during those 72 minutes of executions. It is too soon to say how important this work will be to us, but I am already certain that it will provide us with new insights. It could also potentially become politically significant. \nWhat U \u2013 July 22 offers, as the first work on this subject matter so far, is a sense of presence. It brings us very close to the camaraderie, and the loneliness; it captures frightened breaths. It shows us how easy it was to trip on the steep slopes, how few places there were to hide, how muddy it was (although the real place was even wetter). What we are left with is not mainly images in our minds or sounds in our ears; it is an engulfing bodily sensation. I have felt the island against my back, because I have lain on pine needles along with Kaja and other terrified youths. I have felt Tyrifjorden against my shins, because I have tossed my shoes and attempted to wade to safety upon the sharp rocks there. I have been frozen, by fear and by the cold. I have felt my heart pounding in my chest as I try to hide behind a rock face that offers no shelter. 22 July has, with this film, been given body as well as face. \nAnd this is why I am happy U \u2013 July 22 was made, and that Erik Poppe was the one to pick up this immense challenge and put it on his own, and his collaborators\u2019, shoulders. Together with a strong team of contributors, not least the young amateur actors led by Andrea Berntzen, the director has given life and soul to the events of that day. Working through a trauma that has affected so many is a heavy undertaking, and bringing such a project home requires determination, skill, experience, and a strong moral compass. U \u2013 July 22 is Poppes most important work, and as such it is a good thing that it is also his best. *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik poppe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helge lur\u00e5s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magnus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksander holmen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "issa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorosh sadat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nrk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stoneman douglas high school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ut\u00f8ya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T16:32:06.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34bbff9d28642783f9357df66cad59f28458b0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.JeAKxaZY6lAFOE.fzz1HL9WRZ5YrZivfz4mO6ZGXXcm4ufubgN5xPVHXP3e8MQt1DYaI9Yb90A--", "site_full": "www.mynordickitchen.no", "site": "mynordickitchen.no", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "title_full": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "published": "2018-03-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.258, "main_image": "http://www.mynordickitchen.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/byggryn-2-of-2-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34bbff9d28642783f9357df66cad59f28458b0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.JeAKxaZY6lAFOE.fzz1HL9WRZ5YrZivfz4mO6ZGXXcm4ufubgN5xPVHXP3e8MQt1DYaI9Yb90A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Byggrynsgr\u00f8t | Barley Porridge - way to the north", "text": "Primary Sidebar With love from Oslo \nHi!

The concept? To provide a sumptuous feast to the most vulnerable of Paris while also battling food waste. \nDon\u2019t talk to Bottura about charity. For the only chef in Italy to earn three Michelin stars, his chain of restaurants \u2013 the Refettorii \u2013 is above all a community project. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to recreate a soup kitchen where you have to stand in line. At the Refettorio , we serve them as clientele should be treated, with consideration and dignity,\u201d Bottura told FRANCE 24. \nIn Milan, Modena, London, Rio and, as of March 15, Paris, the most vulnerable will not have to accept food handouts or face the frequently dehumanising soup kitchens. At Bottura\u2019s Refettorio \u2013 which translates as \"recuperate\" or \"restore\"\u2013 they are invited to enjoy a delicious meal carefully prepared by a professional chef in a warm, convivial environment surrounded by exquisite artwork. The Refettorio in Paris opened its doors on March 15, 2018. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul French photographer JR (pictured right) came up with the idea of bringing the Refettorio to Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul The hands of Chef Massimo Bottura are pictured on the plates and wall of the Refettorio in Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul Renowned French chefs Alain Ducasse (pictured left) and Yannick Alleno (pictured right) were in the kitchen for the launch of the Refettorio in Paris. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul \"Beauty restores the soul\". In each of his community kitchens, Bottura has sought to make beauty an indispensible element of his cuisine. \u00a9 Shehan Hanwellage/Food for Soul \n\u201cOn the opening day of our Refettorio in London, a 92-year-old woman told me it was the most beautiful place she had been to in her life. For her, we had created a community. And that\u2019s the very essence of the project. We restore dignity for the forgotten with a stunning dining experience,\u201d the chef said. \nWaste not, want not \n\u201cDo you know what the most important ingredient in a kitchen is? Culture!\u201d Bottura exclaims. \nYet in a world where 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted each year, the link between a cultural experience and cuisine isn\u2019t always obvious. \n\u201cFrom culture comes knowledge, and from knowledge comes awareness, and from awareness comes action. The Refettori aren\u2019t soup kitchens, because in our kitchens we\u2019re not working with urgency. Our meals are a cultural, hopefully life-changing experience. We\u2019re trying to construct a better future. There are more than 860 million people who don\u2019t have enough to eat: the goal isn\u2019t to produce more, but to waste less,\u201d the chef said. \nFor Bottura, 55, a native of the northern Italian city of Modena, the birthplace of \u201ccucina povera\u201d or the art of simple cooking, the fight against food waste is almost innate. From his childhood kitchen table to his community kitchens, not throwing away food is instinctive. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t throw away bread \u2013 that\u2019s sacrilege! Even stale bread can be used to make a delicious recipe, like bread pudding or pesto,\u201d explains Bottura, whose Proustian madeleine cookie recipe calls for one cup of warm milk, bread crumbs and a dash of coffee. \n\u2018You make garbage taste so delicious\u2019 \nCooking with surplus ingredients is an art that Bottura has mastered. \u201cYou make garbage taste so delicious,\u201d the American late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel joked after inviting Bottura to cook on his show in February with leftovers found around the studio. \nThe subtitle of Bottura\u2019s most recent book of recipes, Bread is Gold , more or less sums up the chef\u2019s entire philosophy: \"Extraordinary meals with ordinary ingredients\". \nBottura was trained by the best. \u201cMy fight against food waste is an homage to my grandmother,\u201d he explained. \nGrowing up, food was no laughing matter in the Bottura household. They grew it, cooked it and ate it. \n\u201cI come from a large family. We were at least 10 at every meal \u2013 my brothers and sisters, my cousins, my grandparents, my friends. We grew up with the idea of being together at the table. It was a moment where we could talk to each other, share ideas, dream,\u201d Bottura recalled. \nHis career as a lawyer (\u201cto make my father happy\u201d) was short-lived. Since then, Bottura has been no stranger to success. The Osteria Francescana, his three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Modena is fully booked five months in advance. Want to reserve a table? Prepare to beg. \nAfter winning the \u201c Best Chef in the World \u201d title in 2016, Bottura has nothing left to prove. Yet despite his myriad of awards and honours, he isn\u2019t content serving just the rich and famous. \n\u2018Why should art and fine dining be reserved for the wealthy?\u2019 \n\u201cWhy should art and fine dining be reserved for the wealthy?\u201d Bottura demanded. When reminded of the massive gap between his wealthy clientele at the Osteria Francescana and the more vulnerable patrons at his Refettori community kitchens, Bottura replies matter-of-factly. \u201cThe ingredients may change but the process is still the same.\u201d \n\u201cWho says that a chef should keep his mouth shut behind his stove? That\u2019s absurd,\u201d Bottura\u2019s friend, the Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, exclaimed in a Netflix documentary on the Italian. \nBottura is also a famous activist. In 2010, while hiking in a regional park along the Po River, he came across a ranger who deplored the state of the neglect of the wetlands. The chef kicked up such a fuss that the local government eventually invested \u20ac16 million to restore the park. \nBottura, who is also an advocate of Italy\u2019s Slow Food movement (a group that promotes local food and traditional cooking), was approached in 2012 by a consortium of parmesan cheese producers. A string of earthquakes in Italy\u2019s Emilia-Romagna region had left more than 300,000 wheels of the famous cheese damaged. Bottura came up with the idea of transforming the recipe for cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) into a risotto that replaced the traditional sheep-based pecorino cheese with parmesan. Two months later all of the damaged wheels had been sold. \nThe beginning of Refettorio \nIn 2015, the organisers of the World Expo in Milan invited Bottura to talk on the theme, \u201cFeed the planet\u201d. The Italian chef, however, took it one step further. After founding the non-profit Food for the Soul, he opened his first Refettorio community kitchen in a suburb of Milan. Some of the world\u2019s greatest chefs flocked to support him, preparing meals for the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations using only surplus ingredients. A cuisine and design enthusiast, Bottura also invited artists and architects to help create a warm and inspiring venue. Mens sano in corpore sano , or \u201ca healthy mind in a healthy body\u201d, was his motto. The Refettorio provides a fine dining experience for the most vulnerable populations. \u00a9 Food For Soul To fight against food waste, only surplus ingredients are used in the creation of dishes. \u00a9 Food For Soul Bottura believes that culture is the most important ingredient in any kitchen. \u00a9 Food For Soul \u201cFrom culture comes knowledge, and from knowledge comes awareness, and from awareness comes action,\" said Bottura. \u00a9 Food For Soul \nThe initiative was such a success that the Refettorio, which was meant to shut its doors at the end of the World Expo, remained open. Even better, the model has since been exported abroad. In France, it was the French photographer JR who came up with the idea of launching a Refettorio in Paris while at a dinner party hosted by his friend Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rial, CEO of the travel agency Voyageurs du Monde. Rial is now president of the Refettorio in Paris. \n\u201cJR told me about Massimo Bottura\u2019s Refettorii around the world, and proposed launching one in Paris. I thought it was a great idea: restoring dignity to the impoverished through quality food, a quality environment and the quality of the chefs,\u201d Rial said. \nEvery evening, from Monday through Friday, a team of five staff, including one young chef, prepare approximately 100 meals in the Crypt Restaurant beneath the Madeleine church in Paris\u2019s 8th arrondissement for a clientele made up of migrants and the homeless. The kitchen will regularly be taken over by some of the most famous names in French cuisine, including Alain Ducasse, Yannick All\u00e9no, Jean Imbert, Olivier Rollinger and Michel Bras. \n\u201cChefs can no longer content themselves with cooking in their restaurants. They have a responsibility to the future of global food security,\u201d Bottura argues. On his left arm, a tattoo of the words \u201cNo more excuses\u201d serves to remind us of that.

The Made in France trade show - Premi\u00e8re vision The crafts and trades represented are accessory manufacturing, components, garment and knitwear manufacturing, fabric enhancement and raw materials. In addition, service providers, professional associations and training organisations will also be represented. Vocational training will be this edition's central theme, notably via the presentation of studio work by the Trans-faire workshops, the Atelier du Haut-Anjou and the flexible materials section (shoe and leather accessory makers, upholsterers and trunk-makers) of the Compagnons du Devoir and Tour de France craft associations, as well as via a showcase by nine international designers.The Rencontres du Made in France conferences, organised in partnership with the French Fashion Institute (IFM), will focus on the perennial issue of recruitment and training, at a time when the French government intends to review apprenticeship rules. While France's textile and apparel exports are growing, 45% of entrepreneurs say they struggle to hire skilled workers, and as a result have to cut back on output.One of the conferences will be hosted by the IFM's Dominique Jacomet, with panellists Delphine de Canecaude (Twenty Magazin), Jean-Luc Fran\u00e7ois (Groupement de la Fabrication Fran\u00e7aise) and Olivier Toussaint (of the Le Club des CHO think-tank).Four other conferences are scheduled, their themes ranging from the redirection of sourcing towards France, to the challenges of company acquisitions, the role that a digital approach can play for French craftsmanship, and how French manufacturing is regarded by foreign buyers. Made in France Premi\u00e8re Vision 2017 In 2015, French textile manufacturers' revenues were worth \u20ac7.2 billion, providing 5,700 jobs, while the French apparel industry was worth nearly \u20ac8 billion, with 39,826 jobs.

The 49-year-old, who claimed to be at the Bataclan concert hall where Islamic State attackers killed 90 people, had already been found guilty of fraud on three different occasions. Before her arrest in February she had also been holding a paid job at a charity for victims of the gun and bomb attacks in which jihadists murdered a total of 130 people. In her claim to police in February 2016 the woman told of \"bullets whistling past her ears\" at the Bataclan, but investigators found she had faked a receipt for the concert ticket and other documents to build up her claim for compensation. On top of the 25,000 euros ($31,000) she claimed from the state's FGTI compensation fund for terror victims, she received more than 13,000 euros from the French health service. She is not the first person to be caught impersonating a victim of the carnage at the national stadium and Paris nightspots on November 13, 2015, France's worst attacks since World War II.

See catwalk Prada - Fall-Winter2018 - Womenswear - Milan - \u00a9 PixelFormula According to The Fashion Spot's latest Runway Diversity Report, 32.5% of the models cast to walk in the Fall/Winter 2018 shows this February and March were women of color. The figure represents a 2.3% increase from the previous Spring 2018 season. Notable appearances included supermodel Anok Yai, who, upon opening the Prada show in February, became the first black woman to do so for 20 years. Overall, New York was found to be the most racially diverse fashion city during the Fall 2018 season, followed by London, Paris and finally, Milan.Transgender and non-binary models also saw an increase in catwalk appearances this season, with 56 transgender models and eight non-binary models walking in a total of 52 shows. New York, Paris and London all featured more transgender and non-binary appearances than the last season.However, when it comes to size, it seems the fashion industry is far from being diverse. Although plus-size models such as Ashley Graham and Candice Huffine have seen their profiles skyrocket recently, according to The Fashion Spot, merely 30 plus-size models walked in the Fall Fashion Month shows -- down from 38 last season. Similarly, the number of women aged 50 plus also declined compared to last season, with the total standing at 13 models across all four cities -- 14 fewer than Spring 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anok yai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T21:30:31.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "site_full": "www.infoconcert.com", "site": "infoconcert.com", "site_section": "http://www.infoconcert.com/rss/news.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Infoconcert - News", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "title_full": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://statics-infoconcert.digitick.com/media/artiste/artiste_suite/details/thom_yorke2018_120x150.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22927, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05d5c9fd63134a0a2e79a4a197cc8eb6259e184e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wODMzV2pILnsol7ippDlk0lDq8HCgZAmnMX2sVOyHC_FB90jX6nLYC5IyqBHmaEwSVH4Nuyu5_Ty4vB9CqNBJD_lzTimlg.Hab6zCYDqw2RazWAcwnR08vEWAd2WKMlt.3kgFmmO0kw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T13:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !", "text": "23/03/2018 RESERVEZ / Thom Yorke, leader de Radiohead, en concert solo \u00e0 Paris & Lyon en Juin !

Longest long-haul flights Auckland\u2014Dubai: 17 hours, 25 minutes Perth to London: 17 hours Dallas/Fort Worth\u2014Sydney: 16 hours, 55 minutes Johannesburg\u2014Atlanta: 16 hours, 50 minutes San Francisco\u2014Singapore: 16 hours, 30 minutes Abu Dhabi\u2014Los Angeles: 16 hours, 30 minutes \nWith Qantas launching its 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London this weekend, passengers are now facing one of the longest treks in commercial aviation. \nFlights of this length are not unheard of, with routes from Houston and Dallas to Sydney and direct services such as Los Angeles to Singapore and Auckland to Dubai already on offer for travellers wanting to trade a stopover or two for a direct service. \nAnd while the destinations might differ, the problems rarely do: how do you keep yourself feeling human after three-quarters of a day stuck in a metal tube. \nHere are some tips from the experts on how to cope with spending so long in a confined space. External Link: Nicolas Cage tastes sweet freedom after stepping off a plane in Con Air The doctor \nDry lips, nose, mouth and eyes \u2014 and don't forget the sometimes debilitating jetlag \u2014 are among the most common issues long-haul flyers can expect, according to travel doctor Sandy Dunne. \nBut she points to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot in the leg veins, as the thing flyers should be most mindful of. \nDr Dunne said some people were at higher risk of DVT, including: People who have had DVT previously Women who are pregnant or on female hormone replacement therapy Individuals who are either very tall or short, as well as obese people People who have had recent surgery, or anyone unable to walk around during a flight Photo: Qantas says seats in the economy cabin are roomier. (Supplied: Qantas) \nShe recommends that anyone who is at heightened risk consult a travel doctor ahead of their flight. \nDr Dunne said travellers should ensure they stay well hydrated, and take practical steps to minimise the impact of dryness, such as packing lip balm and eye drops. \nShe strongly advises against using sleeping pills on flights. \n\"If you are drugged out on a sleeping tablet you can stay in one position for a long time and that can increase your risk of DVT,\" she said. The psychologist \nEnvironmental psychologist Rob Hall said airports and, by extension, planes could be places that drew strong emotional responses from people, especially those who were anxious about flying or who were leaving loved ones behind. \nDr Hall said the ultra long-haul experience could take its own particular toll on people, with time disorientation, fatigue, irritability and even the disruption of a person's rhythm of going to the bathroom potentially affecting a passenger's emotional state. Photo: Business class and premium economy seats take up more than half the plane between them. (Supplied: Qantas) \nHe said it was important people find something to keep their mind occupied and find a way to keep moving, even through in-seat exercises \u2014 for which many airlines provide 'how-to' guides. \n\"If you are going on a very long flight, it is worth having a little mental checklist and saying, 'OK, at least once an hour I'll do all these waggly exercises, I'll stand up and maybe walk up and down the aisle once or twice',\" Dr Hall said. \n\"They help you to burn off a bit of muscular energy \u2026 and they protect you from things like deep vein thrombosis.\" The pilot \nCaptain Brad Hodson, Australian and International Pilots Association acting president, said passengers not knowing what to expect might actually be surprised by how quickly time could pass on a long-haul flight. Photo: Captain Brad Hodson says a bit of respect goes a long way on a long flight.

Big job to remove dozens of carcasses \nThe DBCA is working with the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River to remove the dead whales from the beach. \nDNA samples are being taken from the deceased whales to try to determine why the whales became stranded. \nIt will be the local shire's responsibility to dispose of the whale carcasses, which are already creating a powerful smell.

(ABC News: Megan Morris) \nDBCA wildlife officer Pia Courtis said the team was waiting on an excavator to arrive at the beach to be able to save the whales which are still alive. \nDozens of volunteers and wildlife officers will remain there overnight, or for as long as it takes to move the whales to the boat ramp and safely push them back out to sea. \n\"The plan is to get the excavator down here and move the live ones to an area closer to the boat ramp,\" Ms Courtis said. \"Hopefully we'll refloat them and send them back out as a group.\" \nShe said they had no indication of when that might be. \n\"At the moment we've got officers and volunteers down there and they're stabilising the whales,\" she said. \n\"Of course for us our biggest concern is them being out of the water and sunburn.

More than 20 whales were also stranded in the South West town of Bunbury in 2015. \nThe biggest mass stranding of whales in WA was in Dunsborough in 1996, when 320 long-finned pilot whales beached themselves. \n\"The South West capes area has had a number of incidents over the years of stranding of short fin and long fin pilot whales, so they're a species that are common in terms of a stranding scenario,\" Mr Tannock said. \nShort-finned pilot whales can grow to up to 5.5 metres long and are occasionally seen in groups as large as several hundred, but more commonly travel in groups of less than 100. \nThey are brownish-grey to black with a pinkish-grey anchor shape on the undersides, and inhabit tropical and sub-tropical waters, according to DBCA.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy chick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamelin bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leaarne hollowood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of fisheries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of biodiversity", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "augusta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamelin bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T06:08:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b99ced551250ff4f0e57f3e8e1c29d1ff62a9105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i.hp0SI6CFFVm_p_QJuinfcgggEWbR8SdgCVrI7xEhNWgmPrCkEglyMs.1_WsmDkMhvDC3Ehp5mg4LlUZQtNxtN", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au//news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "Do you think midwives are all women?

Photo: Mr Wright has become good friends with Sonya McGuire's family after the births of Archer and Imogen. (ABC News: Alisha O'Flaherty) \nMs McQuire said he was an \"amazing\" midwife and she never felt uncomfortable about his gender. \n\"We got questioned a bit when we were telling people. Family were really supportive, obviously it was our choice,\" she said. \n\"But we were never uncomfortable at all.\" \nMs McQuire said Mr Wright also helped to involve her husband, Jaime, in the birth. \n\"He doesn't quite get the whole birth thing, as a lot of males don't, but Christian really made him get involved and throughout the whole process made sure Jaime was comfortable with what we were hoping to achieve with the birth,\" she said. \n\"It would be good if there were more male midwives. It does make it more relatable to the partners and a better experience.\" \nMs McQuire said her family had developed a close relationship with Mr Wright after the birth of Archer, and he even attended their wedding last year. \n\"We consider him a good friend, not just a midwife,\" she said. The learning curve: 'It blew my mind' \nMr Wright, who has been named as one of the finalists in the 2018 WA Nursing and Midwifery Excellence Awards in the Graduate of the Year category, said he went into the profession with the aim of one day working in developing countries. \n\"I've worked in East Timor and I've done some work in remote areas in Australia, in communities, and I just love it,\" he said. Photo: Mr Wright says there is too much misunderstanding among men about midwifery. (ABC News: Alisha O'Flaherty) \n\"I love being with the community, with people in their setting \u2026 I just really love investing in people and seeing what they can achieve.\" \nMr Wright said he believed the reason so few men went into midwifery was because they did not understand it. \n\"It's a course taught by women, for women, about women, and I really struggled for the first six months,\" he said. \n\"But when I realised what I was learning, it blew my mind. \n\"I think if more guys understood what it was, they would be coming into it.\" Not just 'women's business' \nStatistics from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia show that at the end of December, there were 40 men registered as a nurse and midwife in WA as their principal place of practice, and 467 across Australia. Natalie gave birth to her daughter at home, with only her husband to help. It wasn't an accident \u2014 it was her choice. Figures on the number of women choosing to freebirth are not collated, but researchers and midwives believe it's on the rise. \nAnother 17 men were registered as midwives alone across Australia, with none in WA. \nEdith Cowan University associate professor and associate dean of midwifery, Sara Bayes, said it was a profession that struggled to attract men, with some continuing to view it as \"women's business\". \n\"We probably have one or two per cohort in both of our programs here,\" Dr Bayes said. \n\"The guys who do come into it have a really strong reason for doing it, and that might be that they've had not such a great experience themselves, that they have a genuine wish to support women through a life changing experience or they have very practical reasons, like they might want to go and work for RFDS [the Royal Flying Doctor Service] and that is one of the skills that they need.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian wright", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kemh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king edward memorial hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T02:55:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2aa7913586b5d46ca130670b6bf5a8d6f8d63465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37wLxb.Tss8d.xNLLxuoubhRD76UmSjgHhOul4G9_ka51gvsunexYIgJ7dBwInSw_u_3rq5lUmvnIM5L.Eq1OvO7t.Uncq0ZJAI5xw.50oLC5y3RCfsAOp__IRezVpN31cayvjt_QtsnQw--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.smh.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald - Latest News", "title": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "title_full": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "published": "2018-03-24T07:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_auto/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/18a231c0e9f5ee2f4167624f2934d8d0683ee16c", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1691, "comments": 0, "shares": 1691}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2aa7913586b5d46ca130670b6bf5a8d6f8d63465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37wLxb.Tss8d.xNLLxuoubhRD76UmSjgHhOul4G9_ka51gvsunexYIgJ7dBwInSw_u_3rq5lUmvnIM5L.Eq1OvO7t.Uncq0ZJAI5xw.50oLC5y3RCfsAOp__IRezVpN31cayvjt_QtsnQw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrick Hatch", "published": "2018-03-24T07:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight", "text": "Qantas opens direct link to Europe with historic Perth-London flight By Patrick Hatch Larger text size Very large text size Aviation history is set to be made on Saturday night as Qantas prepares to launch the first-ever non-stop commercial service connecting Australia and Europe. Flight QF9 is due to take off from Perth just before 7pm (10pm eastern time) and is expected to touch down in London just over 17 hours later. The flight will take about 17 hours and 20 minutes. Photo: Brent Winstone/ Qantas Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the service would change Australian aviation forever by connecting \u201cthe last two continents in the world that don\u2019t have a direct link\u201d. \u201cThis is a truly historic flight that opens up a new era of travel. For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link,\u201d Mr Joyce said. \u201cThe original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947. Now we can do it in a single leap.\u201d Advertisement The service operated by Qantas\u2019 first four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners saves about three hours by removing the need to stop over in places such as Dubai or Singapore. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. Photo: Kate Geraghty The flight originates in Melbourne, with those passengers saving about an hour compared to other routes to London. At 14,498 kilometres the journey will be the world\u2019s third-longest service in operation. Qatar Airways\u2019 Doha to Auckland service spans 14,535 kilometres, while Air India\u2019s Delhi to San Francisco service can be shorter or longer than Qantas\u2019 new route (up to 15,127 kilometres) depending on which flight path it takes. Loading The Dreamliners carry up to 236 passengers, which is about half the number on the Airbus A380 Super Jumbos that have until now dominated travel between Australia and Europe, with 70 seats reserved for business and premium class customers. Rico Merkert, an aviation expert at the University of Sydney Business School, said Qantas was trying to attract lucrative corporate travellers with a product that was more comfortable and which saved them time. Qantas can charge more for this premium offering and improve profitability in its international operations, which has been its weakest business unit in recent years during a period of record-low international fares sparked by fierce competition. \u201cTwo hours is worth a lot of money to some of these business people,\u201d Professor Merket said. The Perth-London service will also be a testing ground for Qantas as it moves into an era of ultra-long haul flights. The carrier hopes to be flying non-stop from Sydney and Melbourne to destinations including London and New York by as soon as 2022. Those marathon journeys are beyond the range of Qantas\u2019 Dreamliners, and so the airline is looking to buy either Boeing\u2019s 777-8X or Airbus\u2019 A350-900. As it pushes air travel to unprecedented limits, Qantas is investigating how to alleviate the effects of endurance travel on passengers through a partnership with the Charles Perkins Centre\u2019s Sydney Medical School.

Prestipino 24 March 2018 \u2014 12:11pm Emerging Swan Valley distillery Old Young's has smoked the competition again, named best distillery in Australia for the second consecutive year.\nThe one-man band is orchestrated by former sports administrator and marketer James Young, who operates out of a 36sqm shed in the traditional winemaking region just north of Perth.\nThe craft spirits specialist was also awarded two gold medals at the 2018 Australian Distilled Spirit Awards in Melbourne, one for its Six Seasons Gin for the second year running and another for its Common Gin, a new product launched only last Monday.\nJames Young at his Swan Valley distillery and cellar door.\nPhoto: Supplied Entries from the 86 exhibitors were up 20 per cent on last year, with 297 in total, the majority (130) of which were gin, with 24 gold medals being awarded .\nOld Young's triumph is considerable given its short shelf life but James' bespoke concoctions have proved to be nothing but top shelf, the latest gongs among dozens of national and international accolades in its first two years.\nAdvertisement \"To win Australia\u2019s best distillery in our first year could be seen as beginners' luck,\" James said.\n\"By taking out the award again just shows that we\u2019re doing something right.\n\"My philosophy in starting Old Young's was to work smart, be local, embrace silly and get dirty.\"\nSo particular is James about the make-up of his spirits, he somehow persuaded growers in Italy to provide him with enough Tuscan junipers for his new Common Gin to be 100 per cent made from them.\nClearly the distillery's gamble with innovative spirits is paying off.\n\"Common Gin is a new, navy-strength (57.5 per cent), single botanical gin made solely from our Tuscan juniper,\" James said.\n\"We have quadruped the amount of juniper from our other gins \u2013 it\u2019s a gin for purists, awesome in a G&T and reflects the fascination people have with high quality, interesting spirits at the moment.\"\nJames purchased the mothballed former Wild Swan distillery in 2015 and launched Old Young's in May 2016.\nHe currently produces four very distinct vodkas and five flavour-filled gins, including the multi-award-winning Pavlova Vodka (which tastes as awesome as it sounds) and 1829 Gin.\nJames hopes the whirlwind success of the past two years translates into exposure and sales on the international scene.\nOn Saturday he flies to the US, where he hopes to defend Old Young's 2017 title for Best International Vodka at the American Distilling Institute Craft Spirit Awards.\nThere are also plans to expand operations in the Swan Valley.\nLicense this article What's on Comments disabled", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Inside Devin Booker's 70-Point Game, One Year Later", "text": "B/R Devin Booker was fatigued. The Phoenix Suns guard didn't express it, but then-head coach Earl Watson could read it on his face before the game. The Suns arrived in Boston on the final leg of a back-to-back, the fourth stop of a six-game road trip. They had just suffered a 28-point trouncing from the Brooklyn Nets \u2014their sixth straight loss. Nearly half of Phoenix's roster was out because of injury or \"rest.\"\nWatson, sensing Booker's exhaustion, kept his pregame message brief. \"Be legendary,\" he said. Booker was familiar with the phrase: Lakers legend Kobe Bryant wrote those two words on a pair of Kobe 11s that he signed and gifted the Phoenix prodigy the previous season. Booker looked at Watson and nodded. \"It was a tired nod, but like, I'm here to be a professional ,\" Watson recalled.\nWhat transpired next on TD Garden's parquet floor would generate a leaguewide buzz that is still felt a year later: Booker dropped 70. It was the most points scored by a NBA player since Bryant scored 81 on the Toronto Raptors in 2006. But unlike Bryant's outing, Booker's performance came in a loss. It was just the fifth time in NBA history that a player scored 70 points or more in a losing effort. Wilt Chamberlain did it three times. David Thompson, at 23, scored 73 points with the Denver Nuggets in a two-point loss to the Detroit Pistons on April 9, 1978.\nIn the year since last March 24, many have debated the performance's legacy. Booker became the youngest player in league history to reach that mark, but the game's outcome never hung in the balance. Was it a legitimate 70 points or does the performance deserve an asterisk? Was it just an exceptional offensive night or was it the arrival of a budding young star?\n\nAs those at the game tell it, Booker's 70-point effort was a moment worth celebrating. It just wasn't expected on this particular night and at this particular point in his career. Booker was in his second season and just 20 years old. His team boasted the youngest lineup in NBA\u2014according to Elias Sports Bureau, the Suns' average age was just 21 years, 14 days. Marquese Chriss was 19. Derrick Jones Jr. was 20. Tyler Ulis was 21. Alex Len, the team's center, was the starting lineup's elder statesman, at 23 years old. \"Phoenix pretty much had no other option,\" Doug Haller, who covered the game for the Arizona Republic , said. \"It was just Devin.\"\nBooker got off to a slow start. He missed his first three shots and didn't convert on his first field goal until 4:40 was left in the first quarter. The Celtics made it a priority to hinder Booker's offense from the outset. They ran a steady rotation of Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart, two of their best on-ball defenders, against Phoenix's only scoring threat, and it proved highly effective. By halftime, Boston had opened up a 23-point lead. Booker had 19 points.\nTim Kempton, the Suns' radio color analyst who also played eight years in the NBA, remembered the mood going into the half. \"You're sitting there not really expecting anything,\" he said. \"We're getting drilled by the Celtics. You're just kind of like, Uh-oh. Devin Booker is obviously our best player. He's playing well, but we're getting throttled by the Boston Celtics.\"\n\nEarl Watson Matt York/Associated Press To switch it up, Watson decided to shift Booker over from shooting to point guard\u2014a position normally occupied by Eric Bledsoe, who was sidelined with knee soreness. Phoenix ran a heavy dose of pick-and-roll action, and the Celtics' bigs\u2014Amir Johnson and Kelly Olynyk\u2014struggled to defend it. Booker's numbers soared. He scored 23 points on 5-of-9 shooting in the third, with 11 coming at the foul line. Suddenly, with a quarter left, he had 42 points.\nBut Booker had also taken a beating, physically, against Smart, an aggressive defender who can irritate the opposing team's best player. Booker showed signs of frustration. He complained to the officials that Smart was walking underneath his jumper. At one point, Booker nearly turned his ankle.\nWatson was already low on bodies, and he didn't want to see Booker get hurt, down 97-80 heading into the fourth. \"I kind of looked at [Booker] at the end of the third quarter\u2014it was a look to say, You're done for the game ,\" Watson said. \"He looked at me and shook his head no. I think Marcus Smart kind of got him going. He came out in the fourth quarter, and he just went to work.\"\nBooker took 16 of the team's 27 shots in the final period, and as his numbers climbed, the mood in the arena appeared to shift. \"I remember as he's getting close to 50, I turned and looked at [Kempton] like, Where is this going? \" Haller recalled.\nGary Washburn, a longtime NBA writer for the Boston Globe , was shocked when he looked at the box score during the fourth. \"I saw [Michael] Jordan score 49 on the Clippers way back in the day, and he was just a one-man team,\" he said. \"This was a little different. It was kind like it snuck up on you. All of a sudden he had 55, and you're like, Whoa! Wait a minute. \"\n\nDevin Booker Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press The night took a historic turn with 1:48 left, when a Booker putback gave him 61 points\u2014a new franchise record. (Tom Chambers had set the previous mark of 60 against the Seattle SuperSonics in 1990.) The Boston crowd, normally hostile to opposing players, cheered Booker on. The entire Suns bench was on its feet.\nBut Watson was unaware of the individual performance taking place. During a pair of Booker free throws, Watson turned to his assistant, Nate Bjorkgren, and asked, \"What are they cheering for?\"\n\"Book has 65,\" Bjorkgren responded.\n\"No shit?!\"\n\"Yes, coach.\"\n\"Oh shit. Stay in the game,\" Watson said. In the contest's final 45 seconds, the Suns began intentionally fouling and calling timeouts to stop the clock. Then Watson, during the stoppages, would draw up plays for Booker.\nThe Celtics weren't pleased. Players and coaching staff shouted their disapproval from the bench. The game was already decided, so what was Watson doing?\nHe insisted he was just trying to \"keep chipping the score\"\u2014a lesson he learned from Hubie Brown, whom he considers a mentor. \"If you lose with a young team, you really want those losses to be less than seven,\" Watson said. \"So at the end of the year, you get on the board and you give them a chance to believe.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "devin booker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "earl wa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kobe bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "booker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "phoenix suns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "suns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto raptors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "td garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:05:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "640624b536d26e47334d718467e4511150592d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4onWBjpgEIiygOGVM0gBWMTp3qtvTs.TWjbLdAUVlU4TNkKWdiuDGmeUaLtf5YLcL_h8hC.aaGMmmKImQIa0rZQ--", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://abs-cbnnews.com//sports/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports", "title": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "title_full": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "published": "2018-03-24T06:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/news/03/24/lebron.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1330, "comments": 0, "shares": 1330}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "640624b536d26e47334d718467e4511150592d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4onWBjpgEIiygOGVM0gBWMTp3qtvTs.TWjbLdAUVlU4TNkKWdiuDGmeUaLtf5YLcL_h8hC.aaGMmmKImQIa0rZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2018-03-24T06:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) drives to the basket against Phoenix Suns guard Josh Jackson (20) during the first half at Quicken Loans Arena.

Terrified passengers say that driver was falling asleep and it led to a confrontation caught on video, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports .\nThree of the passengers who were on the bus arrived in Dallas seven hours late from Phoenix.\nSome said they weren't so sure they'd make it in one piece after they caught the driver pinching her cheeks with tweezers just to stay awake. At this point in the bus trip from Phoenix to Dallas, passengers had had enough.\n\"We politely asked her four times to pull over,\" said Jasmine McLellan, who said she was among as many as 60 people who were on board a Greyhound bus who noticed their driver falling asleep behind the wheel.\n\"I got to the point where we saw her going like this and just dozing off,\" said McLellan.\n\"The bus was leaning little and that's when people started to really worry,\" said passenger Philip Hurd. \"She was using techniques to try and stay awake and I think that was the initial concern ... We would go over the white line and everybody would be like wake up and she had tweezers she was poking herself with tweezers to keep herself awake it was awful. It got to the point where we had to raise our voice pull over we have children on this bus pull over.\"\nA confrontation happened while passengers said the bus was still moving and the driver stood up to argue with them.\nPassengers said they got a Border Patrol escort to a safe location where Greyhound replaced the driver.\nThe incident raises serious questions about whether a nationwide shortage of bus drivers is pushing current ones to drive without proper rest.\nDallas-based Greyhound responded with a statement from Senior Communications Specialist Lanesha Gipson:\nOur schedules are now running on time and we're back on schedule. However, we were experiencing delays at the Dallas station earlier today as we waited for drivers to become available once they completed their federally mandated rest. With resources as tight as they have been, any delay that occurs elsewhere can create a domino effect, which can have an impact on a driver's hours of service. We work diligently to accommodate our customers with the limited resources we have available, and we've been actively hiring drivers in order to meet the increasing demand for our service so these types of delays are minimized. All delayed customers have departed the station are now en route to their destinations. \nRegarding the specific incident on the bus headed to Dallas, Gipson issued this statement:\nWe are currently looking into these allegations, as we take the issue of driver fatigue very seriously. Because safety is the cornerstone of our business, we take necessary precautions to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving and we make it easy for drivers to be reassigned if they do feel fatigued or don't feel confident that they can operate the bus safely for any reason. Our drivers are in regular contact with our dispatch office, and if they state they are feeling tired or fatigued, they are immediately removed from the schedule for at least 12 hours to allow them to get some rest.

There were no arrests, they reported. \nMore: At 1 million plus strong, March for Our Lives rallies crush expectations \nLikewise, in Salt Lake City, about 8,000 protesters collided with 1,000 pro-gun counter-demonstrators, exchanged shouts but remaining peaceful, according to police. \nUtah, a state that also allows open-carry, hosted some in the pro-gun rally carrying pistols on their hips and AR-style weapons slung over their shoulders, \"because I can. It's our right,\" Mark Stewart, a counter protester told the Salt Lake Tribune . \nIn Helena, Mont., a March for Our Guns counter event drew about 150 people. Attendees held signs that said \"No guns, No freedom\" and \"Montana treasures God, guns and family.\" \nMike Opie, 32, of Helena, said he felt sorry for the Florida victims, most of whom were high school students. \n\u201cI\u2019m upset kids got shot,\u201d said Opie, who said he served with in the Marines in Iraq. \u201cBut to take guns away is not constitutional.\u201d About 150 attend March for our Guns rally in Helena. #mtnews pic.twitter.com/aYO0zEJFwv \u2014 Phil Drake (@GFTrib_PDrake) March 24, 2018 \nIn Los Angeles, there were only about a dozen counter protesters. They were dwarfed by more than 15,000 people as they were protected by police along the march route. Counter protest so far is about 12 people at 1st and Spring. They are behind police tape as the main march starts to approach. pic.twitter.com/fOjUo4H9Nx \nHours after an anti-gun violence rally in Lansing, Mich., a pro-Second Amendment group hosted speakers on the Michigan Capitol's steps. \n\"If we do not assert our rights, we will lose them,\" said state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, a Republican candidate for governor, \n\"Where was all this when we were having all these shootings years ago?\" asked Hope Coleman, 40, who said she is affiliated with the Patriot movement for President Trump in Phoenix. \"Why should everyone get punished because of someone else's negligence?\" \nIn Phoenix, marcher Sharon Bedney, 77, of Mesa engaged with some of the protesters. \n\"If you can't shoot, you can't teach?\" she asked in response to a protester. \"Teachers are there to teach. They don't need the added pressure.\" \nWilliam Cairnes, 63, of Phoenix, a U.S. Navy veteran, argued with some of the protesters carrying guns. \n\"We want rational control, that's what we want,\" he said. \"This is happening far too often. If we can control their means for mass shootings, shouldn't we at least look into it?\" \nCasey Goble, 19, was among the counterprotesters at the march. He said he was carrying an unloaded AR-15 to make a statement and to exercise his right to do so. \nHe said he supports some measures of gun reform, such as stricter background checks to keep criminals and those with mental-health issues from accessing guns. But he said he came because he supports the Second Amendment. \n\"I support their (protesters') right to have a gun even if they don't like it,\" he said, saying he brought his unloaded AR-15 \"just in case.\" \nJamila Rahim, 20, an Arizona State University sophomore, came to the march with friends. \n\"I get that this is our Second Amendment,\" she said. \"We're not trying to revoke it or take anything away. We just want common-sense gun laws.\" \nShe said she was surprised to find so many like-minded people at the march. \n\"Being here is reassuring,\" she said, adding that if gun reform doesn't happen, \"we'll be back.\" \nBut Rahim said there was a disconnect between those like-minded marchers and the handful of counterprotesters. She feared people may have missed an opportunity to have one-on-one conversations to further discussions on such a controversial issue. \nPeople may be reluctant to have those conversations because they're \"scared of what they're going to hear,\" she said. \n\"Coming out here, we're kind of preaching to the choir anyways,\" Rahim said. \"But going up to them, talking with them, that's where the real change begins.\" \nVan Gutier, 29, said he was there \"standing up for the Bill of Rights.\" \n\"You're playing the blame game,\" he said to a marcher. \"I don't want the government coming up with definitions of who is mentally ill. The government overreaches. The government cares about power. It will try to retain that power by disarming its citizens.\" \nHe said banning guns won't stop mass shootings. \n\u201cWe need to take ownership over ourselves,\" he said. \nKen and Linda Bielek, both 76, were among the marchers. They said they were fed up with a lack of progress on the issue of gun control. They said they don't want to \"take away anybody's guns,\" but do want to see universal background checks and assault-rifle bans. \n\"I don't know of anybody that's saying take away guns from people who have shotguns, a revolver or pistol for home protection or target shooting,\" Ken Bielek said. \"We're not asking the politicians, we're demanding that they ban assault weapons. There's gun violence happening every day. We're fed up with it.\" \nAt one point, Ken Bielek pulled out his pocket Constitution. As a U.S. Army veteran, he said he supports the Second Amendment. But he said the founders couldn't have predicted the rapid change in gun technology. \n\"They had muskets back then,\" he said. \"Today, they're killing machines.\" \nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY, Matt Mencarini, Lansing (Mich.)

Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents. Early on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed. A larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document. Around October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Around the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety. Waymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location. But Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers. Mr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven. When Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role. Uber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions. Waymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode. Not all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Uber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \u201clonger-term financial viability.\u201d Already, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber\u2019s plans for autonomous vehicles. \u201cThe collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cEvery other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven. For Uber, it\u2019s going to be hard to shake.\u201d \nFollow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka \nMike Isaac and Cade Metz contributed reporting.

The prime minister made the statement at the end of an EU summit in Brussels which debated a common strategy over the incident. Download: MP3 \nAndrej Babi\u0161, photo: CTK European Union leaders backed Britain on Thursday in blaming Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former double agent in Britain agreeing to recall the EU envoy to Moscow and opening the door to additional retaliatory steps by some member states. One of the member states likely to take further action is the Czech Republic. Speaking shortly after the summit ended, Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 said Prague would seriously consider expelling a number of Russian diplomats over the incident. \n\u201cWe are seriously considering this course of action and I will discuss the matter on Monday with Foreign Minister Stropnick\u00fd and other members of the cabinet. We are likely to head in this direction.\u201d \nThe prime minister said the number of expelled diplomats would be in the single digits, not dozens and would not include the ambassador. \nThe Czech Republic was directly drawn into the dispute after the Russian Foreign Ministry rejected responsibility for the attack, saying the nerve agent Novichok could easily have come from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, or Great Britain itself. Speaking at NATO headquarters earlier, Mr. Babi\u0161 resolutely rejected the idea calling it as a blatant lie. Czech Foreign Minister Martin Stropnick\u00fd earlier summoned the Russian ambassador to explain the accusation. \nAlthough Prague was among the first to condemn the poisoning and express solidarity with Britain over the incident, the prime minister\u2019s statement that the country would most likely expel a number of diplomats came as a surprise, since earlier both the prime minister and foreign minister had stressed the need for coordinated EU action in this respect. To what extent the Czech prime minister\u2019s one-on-one meeting with his British counterpart Theresa May on the sidelines of the summit may have influenced this decision is not clear. \nRussian diplomats leave Russian Embassy in London, March 20, 2018, photo: CTK In any case, centre-right parties in Prague have strongly supported such a move, saying it was long overdue and stressing that Prague does not need to wait for the big players to come to a decision on this matter. The Communist Party, on the other hand, sees the move as premature and opposition is also likely to come from the country\u2019s president who is widely seen as pro-Russian. \nThe Russian representation in Prague is unusually large, with some 48 diplomats in residence. The Czech intelligence service has in recent years issued warnings regarding heightened activities on the part of Russian and Chinese agents in the country, and political scientists say there is no doubt that Prague has become a hub for Russian activities in broader Central Europe. According to them as many as half of the Russian diplomats here could be undercover agents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrej babi\u0161", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stropnick\u00fd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ctk european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T16:58:04.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4486799053e992027a1dd0979aa0f9be3573d03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hzqEh69FLtTXxYKuyRCZWUREb_Ww9wNVxFy1aZ19BtCeXXRKT_YtR_Jv9ruXhZyL59nFLPgONRQB159DSgGTJZM.i8uMP5Lp1zIj8lqPbpg--", "site_full": "www.radio.cz", "site": "radio.cz", "site_section": "http://radio.cz//feeds/rss/en/en.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Radio Prague - Latest articles", "title": "Czech and Scottish military bands perform in Prague", "title_full": "Czech and Scottish military bands perform in Prague", "published": "2018-03-23T16:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4486799053e992027a1dd0979aa0f9be3573d03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hzqEh69FLtTXxYKuyRCZWUREb_Ww9wNVxFy1aZ19BtCeXXRKT_YtR_Jv9ruXhZyL59nFLPgONRQB159DSgGTJZM.i8uMP5Lp1zIj8lqPbpg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T16:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Czech and Scottish military bands perform in Prague", "text": "Subscribe to RSS \nCzech and Scottish military bands performed at Prague Castle on Friday on the occasion of British Day celebrations. \nThe event, which is part of the Festival of British Culture, is organised by the British Embassy in Prague.

The star of films such as Belle de Jour, The Last Metro, and Indochina, arrived in Prague for the close of the festival. Download: MP3 \nCatherine Deneuve, photo: CTK Catherine Deneuve is nothing less than a legend, having worked together with directors like Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Dem\u00fd and many others. In Prague for the close of Febio Fest, she spoke candidly about her career: what it had been like to work with Gerard Depardieu, who she called very generous as an actor. On the same topic she said she had been a little nervous before the first time she had worked with her daughter Chiara Mastroianni but that that had quickly changed. \n\u201cWhen I worked with my daughter Chiara I thought it would be a little strange at the beginning, you know, it would be someone you know and suddenly you would have to say things to each other from a script. I thought it would be strange. \n\u201cBut finally, it wasn\u2019t at all. We would go to the make-up room, and everything was very natural. I did another film with here recently that hasn\u2019t been released yet directed by Julie Bertucelli, but the whole thing was much more casual than I thought.\u201d \nReceiving a lifetime achievement award like the Kristi\u00e1n for contribution to cinematography is always an invitation, to a degree, for actors to look back on their career. One journalist present suggested the actress, who is 74, could write her memoirs, speculating on all the stories she could tell. But the actress made clear she had no intention of doing any such thing. Deneuve also made clear she was not nostalgic for the 1960s and 1970s when she first achieved fame. Catherine Deneuve again: \n\u201cMaybe I enjoy [making films] today more today than I did 40 years ago because I know more about filming and being part of the whole troupe, being part of the crew; because I have friends who write screenplays and who are directors or are technicians. I know more about filmmaking and the process so I also more patient.

Print version The Latvian Consumer Rights Protection Center (PTAC) has imposed an EUR 18,700 fine on Sugar Media concert organizer owner by an Estonian businessman, PTAC reported LETA. \nPTAC informed that in the time period from July 2017 until October 2017 the European Consumers Information Center and PTAC received 15 complaints about two-day festival Retro Beach Fest 2017 in Lithuanian city Zarasai and Egor Kreed \u2019s concert in Dzintari concert hall in Jurmala, Latvia, both organized by Sugar Media . \nPTAC discovered that during the Retro Beach Fest 2017, the performing artists were not those as promised by the organizer, and the organizer had not reduced the ticket price or refunded tickets after receiving complaints from customers. PTAC thus concludes that the company not only has failed to comply with the service agreement, but has deceived consumers, providing false information on artists performing at the festival. \nIn total, 5,000 tickets were sold to the festival, the prices ranged from EUR 18 to EUR 29, and the estimated loss is at least EUR 90,000. \nEgor Kreed\u2019s concert planned on August 8 was cancelled, and only a part of consumers got their tickets refunded because Sugar Media had not transferred all the necessary funds to Bilesu Service ticket office. Thus, 61 tickets for a total sum of EUR 3,055 were not refunded. \nPTAC has tried to contact Sugar Media several times, demanding to stop the unfair commercial practice and provide all the necessary information, but the company did not cooperate and did not settle the problems. \nPTAC thus concluded that Sugar Media \u2019s commercial practice is unfair and deceiving, and decided to fine the company with EUR 18,700. \nAccording to Firmas.lv business database, Sugar Media was registered in Latvia in May 2016. Its share capital is EUR 2,800, and the company belongs to an Estonian citizen. \nThe company closed 2016 with EUR 187,003 in turnover and EUR 742 in profit. According to the State Revenue Service data, on March 7, Sugar Media had a tax debt of EUR 14,920, and the company\u2019s value added tax (VAT) certificate has been annulled.

Print version The Latvian parliament today passed in the final reading amendments to the Education Law and the Law on General Education under which schools of ethnic minorities will have to start gradual transition to Latvian-only secondary education in the 2019/2020 academic year, reports LETA. \nThe 100-member parliament passed the bills with 58 votes for and 13 votes against. \nEducation and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity) proposed the education reform in early October 2017, which caused yet another wave of protests from Latvia's Russian-speaking community. \nPrime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) stressed the education reform had to be adopted quickly so that the question would not be used in the election campaigns ahead of the general elections planned in early October this year. \nThe government approved the proposed legislative amendments in late January 2018, and the parliament started discussing the bills at the beginning of January. The lawmakers also turned down the petition calling for preserving bilingual education in Latvia that was signed by over 10,000 Latvian citizens. \nDespite numerous proposals to alter the education reform in the ethnic minority school or to scrap it altogether, the bills submitted to the parliament for the third and final reading are practically the same as approved by the government earlier. The legislative amendments providing for a gradual transition to education in Latvian in all public schools will be implemented gradually from September 1, 2019, to September 1, 2021. \nAlready in preschools, starting from the age of five, new education guidelines will be introduced in 2019/2020 school year, providing for a bigger role of the Latvian language in the study process. \nA new bilingual education model will be introduced in grades 1-6, ensuring that at least 50% of the subjects are taught in Latvian, and in grades 7-9, ensuring that at least 80% of the study contents is in Latvian in 2019/2020. The final exams for the 9th grade pupils will be held entirely in Latvia. \nStarting from 2020/2021 school year all general education subjects in grades 10 and 11 will be taught only in the Latvian language, while children of ethnic minorities will continue learning their native language, literature and subjects related to culture and history in the respective minority language. \nStarting from 2021/2022 school year all general education subjects in high school (grades 10-12) will be taught only in the Latvian language, while children of ethnic minorities will continue learning their native language, literature and subjects related to culture and history in the respective minority language.

The ratings, carrying a \u2018Stable\u2019 outlook, was given based on Maalem\u2019s \u201cvery sound\u201d capital base together with its low leverage, ample liquidity that comfortably covers short-term debt, and improved asset quality.\nMaalem stated that Capital Intelligence also attributed the rating to the growth potential of the financing market in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular financing for small- and medium-sized entities (SMEs), which represents a key target segment for Maalem Financing.\nLicensed by the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority (SAMA) in 2016, Maalem Financing is a non-banking finance company (NBFC) operating on Shariah basis in Saudi Arabia. It has reported brisk growth in its financing portfolio, consisting entirely of Murabaha receivables in the first quarters of 2017.\n\u201cMaalem Financing has achieved a major milestone, having received its first-time corporate ratings carrying a stable outlook. The ratings reflect Maalem\u2019s status as one of the fastest growing Shariah-based financial institutions in Saudi Arabia with good governance and sound financial management. Maalem aims to consolidate its position in the market by focusing on the strengths of its operations and executive team, built on international best practices as well as its experiences gained from the local market,\u201d said Aymen Sejiny, chairman of MFC.\nWhile assigning the corporate ratings, Capital Intelligence has highlighted the opportunity before Maalem to capitalize on the growth potential of the local financing market, especially in the SME sector, which has a significant gap in lending demand and supply.\nThe rating agency has noted Maalem\u2019s improved asset quality metrics by the end of the third quarter as non-performing financing receivables (NPFRs) declined in absolute terms, driven by higher collections. It has also observed that the ratio of NPFRs to total financing has improved to a level that is considered satisfactory for an NBFC.\nCapital Intelligence has also taken into account the fact that the loss coverage of Maalem\u2019s NPFRs has increased significantly from a very low point in 2016. Besides, its leverage is one of the lowest recorded among Capital Intelligence\u2019s rated NBFCs.\nMaalem Financing\u2019s capital base strengthened considerably after it issued SR50 million in share capital in 2017. This has acted as a mitigating factor for the modest loss reserve of NPFRs by enhancing the effective coverage ratio, while also providing ample scope for further credit growth.\nCapital Intelligence has observed that Maalem\u2019s low leverage means that it is unlikely to encounter vulnerabilities to liquidity pressures as the financial institution had been prudent in matching its rapid lending growth in the first three quarters of 2017 with pre-arranged new funding.\nMaalem\u2019s coverage of short-term liabilities by liquid assets, including cash and short-term financing receivables, was robust at end of the third quarter of 2017. This reflected the long-term maturity of its single debt facility and the short-term nature of the bulk of its financing, together with the enhanced liquidity buffer provided by higher bank balances.\nStarting its operations in 2009, Maalem obtained a license from SAMA in 2016 for delivering finance to individuals and SMEs. Maalem has recorded strong earnings in recent years, enjoying solid financing income generation thanks to good margins on its financing receivables portfolio. As at the end of September 2017, the company reported consolidated assets of SR231 million ($62 million). \u2014 SG", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maalem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maalem financing company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "capital intelligence ratings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capital intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia monetary authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murabaha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T20:23:14.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fedc384799c4831a0410afad207692dca7079107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO6x4Do9vn14YkXfdv9aykS072teA.ARyD86MWsl6xpAgdhFbDzHip64K8ezo867.qSHtXGrCU.1Qu2lWppTbw_moQLdWdJlAkn25swjLOnGSV_M7nlgx7kC", "site_full": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site_section": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Saudi Gazette/ Home Page", "title": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story", "title_full": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story - Saudi Gazette", "published": "2018-03-24T00:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2018/03/24/772155.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29738, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fedc384799c4831a0410afad207692dca7079107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO6x4Do9vn14YkXfdv9aykS072teA.ARyD86MWsl6xpAgdhFbDzHip64K8ezo867.qSHtXGrCU.1Qu2lWppTbw_moQLdWdJlAkn25swjLOnGSV_M7nlgx7kC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mariam Nihal", "published": "2018-03-24T00:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018Reframe Saudi\u2019 Helps Share Saudi Arabia\u2019s Incredible Story", "text": "Mariam Nihal\nSaudi Gazette\nDirected by Matteo Lonardi, Reframe Saudi is a Virtual Reality documentary that uses cultural narratives to explore Saudi Arabia. It gives the world a chance to delve deeper into the cultural dynamics of the Kingdom through local artists who are shaping the future and starting conversations with the world by sharing their experiences and perspectives. It features Ahmad Angawi, Dana Awartani, Rashed Al-Shashai, Ajlan Gharem, Zahra Al-Ghamdi, Ayman Yossri Daydban, Jameela Mater, Ahaad Alamoudi and Ali Mogawi working within the confines of their studios between Jeddah, Abha and Riyadh. The movie is shot around the Kingdom showcasing the stunning landscape and never-seen-before footage of rural and present-day spaces in a manner that transports one to Saudi Arabia via a VR headset. \u201cReframe Saudi is a VR documentary about the art scene in Saudi Arabia, showcasing nine artists and how they reflect in their environment,\u201d Lonardi told Saudi Gazette. \u201cI always talk about contemporary issues in society through artists specifically through VR. I have done something similar for Tehran. I worked with many artists especially Ahmed Mater who watched Reframe Tehran. I pitched the idea to him and Stephen Stapleton, and they really wanted to do it. It took us two years to do it,\u201d he added. Visitors at Art Dubai experienced a preview of the film, with a VR headset and headphones. \u201cIt was a wonderful experience, I felt like I was with the artists and I could move around the landscape by just turning around as if I was there. The whole experience was mind-blowing and I can\u2019t wait to watch the film,\u201d Mona Ali, a visitor at Art Dubai told Saudi Gazette. The preview was followed by a panel discussion on VR and Contemporary Art, moderated by Marisa Mazria Katz with World VR Forum Director, Salar Sahna, VR film maker Matteo Lonardi and Saudi Artist Ahaad Alamoudi. \u201cIt took 12 days to shoot the entire footage. We are looking to launch the film in June this year,\u201d Lonardi told Saudi Gazette. The documentary was launched at Art Dubai following the partnership between the fair and Misk Art Institute headed by Ahmed Mater.

The competition at the Rosh Rayhaan Hotel here on Thursday was organized by the German-Saudi Arabian Liaison Office for Economic Affairs (GESALO) and was attended by Princess Johara Bint Talal as guest of honor.\nDetecon Al-Saudia (DETASAD), an end-to-end ICT solution provider and a leading contributor of ICT sector of Saudi Arabia for more than 35 years, sponsored the 1st German-Saudi Startup Competition organized by GESALO. This event gave Saudi entrepreneurs the opportunity to pitch their business models to a jury. The winners will then represent their company at the MENA Business Forum in Berlin during a four-day startup tour in Germany. This will allow them to network with leading investors, potential partners, and other stakeholders in the startup ecosystem.\nIn his welcoming remarks, the delegate of German Industry and Commerce for Saudi-Arabia, Bahrain and Yemen, Oliver Oehms, explained, \u201cToday is about start-ups and entrepreneurship and we will bring the two winning start-ups to Berlin to showcase promising Saudi start-ups at a very interesting conference, the MENA Business Forum. Small and medium-sized companies and innovative business ideas are the key drivers of the German economy and a growing sector in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nAmbassador Dieter Haller commended the guest of honor for giving a wonderful example for Saudi entrepreneurs and for helping to empower Saudi women. Regarding the start-up competition he went on: \u201cThe Saudi start-up is as vital and dynamic as any other segment of the Saudi society. We have thought that we should bring the Saudi and the German start-up scene together and one of the most fertile places for start-ups is Berlin. I am so happy that the two winning start-ups will be invited to this important conference in Berlin. My hope is that we will establish a continuous platform for the exchange of ideas and best practices between German start-ups and Saudi start-ups.\u201d\nFollowing the official opening, the ten finalists from Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, Taif and Madinah competed in two groups. They had two minutes to pitch their business ideas in front of the German-Saudi business community and a high-ranking jury, which had another two minutes for follow-up questions.\nIn the group of social entrepreneurship start-ups the winner was \u201cLabayh\u201d from Madinah. The project helps individuals who are suffering from family and psychological problems by useful free content and providing consultation sessions through a mobile app, which works as a point of connection between consultants and users.\nIn the group of tech innovation start-ups the winner was \u201cLucidya\u201d from Jeddah. The company aims at empowering businesses in order to make smarter decisions by using artificial intelligence and big data technologies, so that they monitor and analyze all forms of digital media to understand and predict consumers\u2019 thoughts.\nThe two winners will travel to Germany from April 11 to 14 and get the chance to pitch at the Mena Business Forum on April 12.

Mark was at that time on a holiday in Saudi Arabia to visit some famous cities like Riyadh, Abha, and Jeddah for 10 days.\nMark is a well-known millionaire and also a practiced lawyer in Los Angeles, specializing in cases of civil laws. The last big case he handled was the case of the famous American pop singer, Michael Jackson, a week before he passed away.\nA tourist guide who accompanied Mark for 10 days in Saudi Arabia, Dhawi Ben Nashir said, \u201cSince he set foot for the first time in Saudi Arabia, Mark already started to ask questions about Islam and the prayer. As soon as he arrived in Saudi Arabia, Mark stayed in Riyadh for two days. While in Riyadh, Mark was very interested in Islam. After moving to Najran, we went to Abha and Al-Ula. There, his fascination for Islam grew more obvious, especially the time when we ventured out into the desert.\u201d\n\u201cMark was amazed to see three Saudi youths who were in our group in Al-Ula, performing the prayer in the expanse of the very wide desert; a very fantastic panorama indeed.\u201d\n\u201cAfter two days in Al-Ula, we went to Al-Juf. As soon as we arrived in Al-Juf, Mark asked if I could get him some books on Islam. I then obtained some books on Islam for him. Mark read all those books. The next morning, he asked me to teach him how to perform the prayer. I then taught him how to pray and make wudhu (ablution). Then, he joined me and performed the prayer beside me.\u201d\n\u201cAfter prayer, Mark told me that he felt peace in his soul. On Thursday afternoon, we left Al-Ula heading for Jeddah. He looked very serious throughout the journey reading those books about Islam. On Friday morning, we visited the old town of Jeddah. Before the time for the Friday prayer approached, we went back to the hotel and I excused myself to go for the Friday prayer.\u201d\nMark said to his companion, \u201cI would like to join you for the Friday prayer so that I can witness myself how the Friday prayer is like.\u201d\nHis friend, Dhawi Ben Nashir, welcomed the idea.\nDhawi Ben Nashir said, \u201cWe then went to a masjid which was not far from the hotel where we stayed in Jeddah. Since we were quite late, I and many others had to pray outside, as the number of worshippers was overflowing. I could see Mark observing the people in congregation, especially after the Friday prayer was completed, when everybody was shaking hands and embracing each other with radiant and happy faces. Mark was very impressed with what he saw.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we returned to the hotel, Mark suddenly told me that he wanted to become a Muslim. So I said to him, \u2018Please take a shower first.\u2019 After Mark took the shower, I guided him in saying the shahadah (declaration of faith) and then he prayed two rakaah. Later on, Mark expressed his desire to visit the Grand Mosque in Makkah and perform prayers there before leaving Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his wish, we went to the Da\u2019wah Center in Jeddah to obtain a formal proof of his conversion to Islam, so that he would be allowed to enter the city of Makkah and the Grand Mosque. Mark was given a temporary certificate of his conversion to Islam, and he visited the holy city of Makkah.\u201d\nAfter Mark declared his Islamic faith, he had the chance to express his experience to Al-Riyadh Newspaper, saying, \u201cI could not express my feelings at this time but I am being reborn and my life has just started. I am very happy. This happiness that I am feeling could not be expressed in words, especially when I visited the Grand Mosque and noble Ka\u2019bah.\u201d\nRegarding his next step after his conversion to Islam, Mark explained that he wants to learn more about Islam, delve deeper into the religion of Allah (Islam), and come back to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj.\nAs to what impelled him into converting to Islam, Mark explained, \u201cI already had information about Islam, but it was very limited. When I visited Saudi Arabia and personally witnessed the Muslims there, and saw how they performed the prayer, I felt a very strong drive to know more about Islam. When I read true information about Islam, I became confident that Islam is a religion of haq (truth).\u201d\nSunday morning, 18th October 2009, Mark left the Airport of King Abdul Aziz Jeddah heading for America. When filling in the immigration form before leaving Jeddah, Mark wrote ISLAM as his religion. \u2014 Courtesy of Discovering Islam", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark shaffer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhawi ben nashir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "islam", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeddah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T13:10:02.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "154af6e1453462ee55dc704bb7bef657e7524ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO4.8anus4nzJGsypjV0OrhP8qNgNyPdKLZ2kesijtoktGAG3yKlrA8WHixmgBj0coiqE45jbk__IOGwc1LAl.AfQ7jmEY7szHE-", "site_full": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site": "saudigazette.com.sa", "site_section": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/morearticles/Business/3", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Saudi Gazette/ BUSINESS", "title": "Saudia to begin flights to Malaga for summer season", "title_full": "Saudia to begin flights to Malaga for summer season - Saudi Gazette", "published": "2018-03-21T16:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SA", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2018/03/21/768592.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29738, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "154af6e1453462ee55dc704bb7bef657e7524ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpbwcZeGIouv3yUI2mjKb3hdzQ2VtsUyO4.8anus4nzJGsypjV0OrhP8qNgNyPdKLZ2kesijtoktGAG3yKlrA8WHixmgBj0coiqE45jbk__IOGwc1LAl.AfQ7jmEY7szHE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "saudigazette.com.sa", "published": "2018-03-21T16:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Saudia to begin flights to Malaga for summer season", "text": "SAUDI Arabian Airlines (Saudia) announced new seasonal services for the upcoming summer period to Malaga, Spain starting from June 9.\nThe four-times-weekly flights are scheduled:\n\u2022 Wednesdays and Saturdays: Riyadh to Malaga\n\u2022 Thursdays and Mondays: Jeddah to Malaga\nThe total journey time from Riyadh to Malaga is six hours and 40 minutes and from Jeddah to Malaga, six hours and 35 minutes.

A deal between the centre right, including the League, and the M5S to give the Speakership of the Senate to the former and the House to the latter broke down Thursday. The M5S rejected the F1 candidate for Senate Speaker, former Senate Whip Paolo Romani, because he is under investigation for alleged misuse of a municipal cellphone in the northern city of Monza. The M5S said Friday they would \"never resurrect\" the so-called Nazarene Pact formerly between FI leader Silvio Berlusconi and PD ex-leader Matteo Renzi. \"No blackmail, we won't rehabilitate Berlusconi,\" said M5S Senate Whip Danilo Toninelli. PD caretaker leader Maurizio Martina said \"the stalemate is getting more complicated, and what we need are guarantor figures\". Small rightist Brothers of Italy (FdI) leader Giorgia Meloni said \"the stalemate is due to infantile posturing\". The parties went on to notch their first failure to elect a Lower House Speaker amid the stalemate. No candidate reached the required 420 votes needed in the first ballot in the 630-seat chamber. That corresponds to two thirds of the seats in the Lower House. The second and third ballots lowers the quorum by counting blank ballots. A two-thirds majority is needed to elect the new Speaker in the first three rounds of voting, after which an absolute majority suffices. Some 620 MPs took part in the vote, 592 filing blank ballots and 18 spoiling their ballots. Votes were cast for Brunetta (2), Muroni (2), Stumpo (2), Bonafede (2), Ermini (1), Lupi (1) and Tripiedi (1). The two winners of the general election were the M5S, which got 32%, and the League, which got 17.5% to become top dog on the centre right, which as a whole got 37%.

And I\u2019m a forward-looking guy who doesn\u2019t spend much time dwelling on whether I should be home again,\u201d says Amsler, born in the north-eastern Swiss canton of Schaffhausen in 1936. On a recent visit to Switzerland, he dropped by swissinfo.ch to talk about his study of a Ticino village with remarkable architecture. \nWithout knowing that he\u2019s an octogenarian, you wouldn\u2019t think to offer the elevator, and Amsler takes the stairs in stride, asking, \u201cIs this a new building?\u201d and looking around with curiosity. Atlantic crossing \nHaving been offered a travel fellowship to see American architecture first-hand, Amsler and his wife and two young children embarked on the five-day cruise from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to New York City. From there they headed up the coast to Duxbury, Massachusetts, where Amsler had a contact. \n\u201cThe idea was to have an experience and then to go back to Switzerland,\u201d laughs Amsler. But it didn\u2019t work out that way \u2013 \u201cprimarily because I immediately got immersed in very interesting and relatively independent work \u2013 even as an employee\u201d. \nOne of his most prominent projects was the control tower at Logan International Airport in Boston. Amsler\u2019s employer, architecture firm Desmond and Lord, assigned him the role of project manager. \n\u201cAt the time it was the highest control tower in the world. It\u2019s unusual because it has two legs and is connected at the top, and that was because Massachusetts required two exits, so there are stairs in each leg,\u201d explains Amsler. Also at Logan Airport, he designed a hangar and worked on the central power plant and international terminal, which was expanding at the time. \nAmsler also designed the Southeastern Massachusetts University campus, which is now the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Later, he and two friends started their own firm, and Amsler acted as an independent contractor as well. At home in Marblehead \nWhile working in Boston, Amsler found a dream house north of the city: a small \u201csummer\u201d home across the street from the ocean in Marblehead. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not unlike a small town in Switzerland. We were lucky to end up in a town that is much more European-feeling than American-feeling. All the houses are wooden and the streets are crooked. So we felt very much at home there,\u201d Amsler says. \nBut it was about five years before he and his family could afford a visit to Switzerland. \nAmsler says he was never homesick, but of course he missed friends \u2013 and certain foods. \n\u201cAt the beginning, you only got spongy bread in America, but we don\u2019t have that problem anymore. Same thing with cheeses. You had maybe two or three in the supermarket then, but that\u2019s changed so we can get everything now. We can even buy Swiss chocolate.\u201d \nWhat Amsler still misses is the traditional Swiss-style sausage, called \u201cBratwurst\u201d in German. He sometimes places an order with a special sausage company in Colorado. \n\u201cWhen we have a big party, I\u2019ll order 50 bratwursts to grill, and people love \u2019em,\u201d Amsler says with relish. \nMeanwhile, he\u2019s come to appreciate the local cuisine; particularly sweet corn sold at local farm stands and seafood from the local waters. \n\u201cWe have great fish restaurants in Marblehead. Great lobster, fish, seafood in general,\u201d Amsler notes. Something special about New England \nExcept for visits, Amsler can\u2019t imagine returning to Switzerland at this point. \n\u201cFor one thing, I can\u2019t afford it \u2013 to live in a place as nice as I live now. That\u2019s the main reason. And the other reason is that all my direct family is now American,\u201d says Amsler, now a dual citizen, divorced, and with a new partner. \nAnd besides, he\u2019s in love with New England, too. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in another country for that long, it\u2019s not only new friends that you make, but it\u2019s just the place itself. I love New England; there\u2019s something very special about it,\u201d Amsler says. He especially likes the rugged countryside and the ocean, and he also loves Cape Cod for its history, beauty, and the beaches where he goes windsurfing. \nIn winter, he\u2019s drawn to the mountains of New England. \n\u201cI still go snowboarding once a week if you can believe it \u2013 at my age! My kids say to me, \u2018You\u2019re crazy \u2013 you should stop\u2019,\u201d chuckles Amsler. You can tell he has no intention of doing so. \n\u00a9 swissinfo.ch The above content produced by swissinfo.ch is not intended for commercial use and may not be republished by third parties either wholly or in part.

The public defence takes place in the Senaatszaal at Erasmus University Rotterdam, at 11.30 a.m. \nThis study focuses on the civil justice system competition in the EU, a form of regulatory competition in which states try to attract parties to litigate in their jurisdictions. In this study, the term civil justice system refers to the whole apparatus involved in the resolution and enforcement of civil disputes. Many institutions and parties are engaged in this process, with courts, lawyers, and governments being the obvious examples. In this context, the present study\u2019s main research question is \u2018How do civil justice systems compete in the EU?\u2019 \nTo arrive at an answer, both a theoretical and an empirical approach are taken. The theoretical part considers various aspects of competition, but most importantly it offers an overview of regulatory competition, an analysis of the legal framework within which Member States operate, and an analysis of the civil justice system market and its elements. Based on the theoretical analysis, the empirical part is divided into two components; the first contains an analysis of data provided by the 2016 EU Justice Scoreboard, while the second analyses a survey on lawyers\u2019 court preferences in the EU that has been conducted for this research. The symbiosis between the theoretical and the empirical part adds more depth to the research, and contributes new data and analyses to the ongoing academic debate.

Photo: @geertwilderspvv / Twitter \nGeert Wilders and his PVV won city council seats seats in each one of the 30 municipalities the party participated in during the municipal elections on Wednesday. In total the PVV currently stands on 74 seats, the Volkskrant reports. \nDuring the previous municipal elections four years ago, the PVV only participated in two municipalities - Almere and The Hague. The party got fewer seats in those two municipalities this time around. In Almere the party dropped from nine to seven seats, and in The Hague from seven to two seats. \nIn Nissewaard, which covers Spijkenisse and its surroundings, the party won five seats. Relatively, the PVV got the most votes in Rucphen - 20.3 percent - giving it four seats. The PVV also won four seats in Terneuzen and in Venlo, and two in Rotterdam. The party is now also in the city councils of cities like Zaanstad, Enschede, Zoetermeer, Arnhem, Maastricht and Den Bosch. \nNot all the votes are counted yet, so the PVV may get a few more seats. In Utrecht the party stands on one so far, and in Stichtse Vecht on two. \n\"Fantastic!\" Wilders wrote on Twitter. \"Great results in Nissewaard, Venlo, Terneuzen, Rucphen, Maastricht, Zaanstad, Emmen, Almelo, Lelystad, Dordrecht and many other municipalities where the PVV sound will be heard from now on! The PVV is growing!!\" Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "geert wilders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "den", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arnhem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spijkenisse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rotterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "almere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaanstad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venlo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terneuzen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duindorp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rucphen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoetermeer", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-22T21:31:41.019+02:00"}], "totalResults": 6, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745836225&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3ANL+location%3ARotterdam&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 918, "extra": {"place": "Rotterdam", "country": "NL", "lat": "51.9244201", "lng": "4.4777326"}}]
