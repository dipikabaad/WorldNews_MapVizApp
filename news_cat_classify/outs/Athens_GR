It is only the latest and most impressive result of feverish, multi-faceted diplomatic efforts by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to achieve a mobilisation of international organisations of which Greece is a member (the EU, Nato, and the UN), but also to draw the support individually of major international players - including the US, Germany and Russia - in order to shield Athens from Turkey\u2019s mounting aggressiveness and expansionist aspirations. Russia card: Putin invites Greek PM to Moscow Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a lengthy telephone conversation yesterday with Alexis Tsipras, invited the Greek PM to visit Moscow, and the two leaders discussed, among other issues, Greek-Turkish affairs and regional developments. Athens had every reason to be satisfied by the solidarity offered by its EU partners in defending Greece\u2019s sovereignty and avoiding a military clash. Solidarity from EU partners In the conclusions of the EU summit, European leaders expressed solidarity with Greece and Cyprus and condemned Turkey\u2019s behaviour with exceptionally strong language. Greek diplomatic sources underlined the EU\u2019s unprecedented use of the word \u201ccondemnation\u201d in responding to Turkeys\u2019 \u201cillegal activities\u201d and hostile behaviour towards Greece and Cyprus. At the same time, Athens received a commitment from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk, that they would push for the release of the two Greek army officers - who were captured by Turkish forces and imprisoned - at an EU-Turkey summit meeting on 26 March, in the Bulgarian city of Varna. Tsipras asked Juncker to request concrete guarantees from Erdogan that he will acknowledge the sovereign rights of Greece and undertake an initiative to free the two Greek army officers. At the summit, Tsipras also expressed solidarity with the UK regarding the recent attack with a nerve agent on its territory, but also stressed the need to maintain open channels of communication with Moscow. He said he supports the engagement of both the EU and Nato with Russia.

Indicatively, scheduled airline seats from Germany are up by 45 percent . SETE President Yiannis Retsos. \nHowever, Retsos underlined that the specific data, which was collected by January 31, is subject to continuous changes, as cancellations or extra flights may be added. A more accurate picture of the scheduled airline seats should be available by late May. \nAccording to SETE Intelligence data, Greece ranks among the top 10 most popular destinations for travelers from 16 from the largest tourism markets (except the United States and Russia). Greece is also in the top 5 Mediterranean destinations preferred by travelers from the same markets. Issues confronting tourism \nDespite announcing encouraging figures for the 2018 tourism season in Greece, SETE\u2019s president referred to issues that may possibility lead to a decline in Greece\u2019s tourism numbers in the coming years. \n\u201cIf the issues that we are constantly referring to \u2014 tourism investments, spatial planning and overtaxation \u2014 are not dealt with (by the government) within the next 18 to 24 months, then we will see an impact on our tourism activity in the coming years,\u201d Retsos stressed. \nHe also referred to the rise in popularity this year of competitor destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, which faced problems in previous years. \nIn regards to talk about geopolitical developments affecting Greece\u2019s tourism progress, Retsos said that \u201cextreme statements\u201d on the issue should be avoided. \u201cThis is a huge issue worldwide and something that is beyond our control\u2026 What we have to do is continue to do our job well and improve our offered services,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAny talk about geopolitics just creates anxiety, without actually leading to any result,\u201d he added. \nReferring to SETE\u2019s aims for Greek tourism, Retsos said the confederation\u2019s strategy includes strengthening ties with Brussels , following its recent visit to the European Commission in February.
