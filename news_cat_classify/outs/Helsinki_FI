Finland's Palm Sunday tradition brings witches to the door Image: Antti Haanp\u00e4\u00e4/Yle \nWitches, cats and bunnies are out this Sunday, carrying willow branches ornamented with bright feathers and tissue paper. They might show up at your door, where they will recite a rhyme wishing you health for the following year. The youngsters will then expect Easter candy in trade for the branch, which you get to keep as a memory of their visit. \nReminiscent of the trick-or-treat tradition in the British Isles and North America, this practice is believed to be a mixture of Orthodox Easter blessing customs from Eastern Finland with pre-Christian rituals from Western Finland and Scandinavia. \nIn the northwestern region of Ostrobothnia, kids wait until the Saturday before Easter to partake in the tradition. \nUnna Nummelin from Helsinki put her costume together in the morning, complete with an apron and a scarf for her head. A bit of red rouge on her cheeks and she is transformed into an Easter witch. The tradition requires that the children dress as witches, but in the last few decades, the dress code has been expanded to include all manner of costumes. \n\"I'm not nervous about it anymore. We'll just knock on doors until we run out of branches,\" she says. \nLaura Larres was part of a three-person team that decorated branches for the big day. \n\"I had intended to prepare them during the youngest child's nap, but he didn't end up sleeping very long, so it ended up being a pretty hectic decorating process. I think this is a great tradition, even so. It is rewarded to see the children having fun,\" she says. Unna Nummelin has several years of Palm Sunday witching under her belt. She is trying her luck this year in the Helsinki district of Maunula. Image: Antti Haanp\u00e4\u00e4/Yle Chocolate eggs seem to be the treat of choice.

Image: Mikko Savolainen/Yle \nA dozen solar panels gleam in the sun on the roof of a semi-detached house in Herttoniemi, eastern Helsinki. In March, some of the panels are still covered with snow, but the homeowner says that the longer, brighter spring days are already spurring a noticeable increase in electricity production. \n\u201cYesterday we had an output of 1,000 watts. Sometimes the summer it gets up to 3,000 watts a day,\u201d says homeowner Timo Juutilainen. \nWith a gently-sloping south-facing roof on the seashore, the location is ideal for solar energy production in northern Europe. Juutilainen installed the panels two years ago and has been satisfied with how they work. \nA month ago, the family put in an electricity storage unit that retains electricity generated by the panels for 3-4 hours. \nStory continues after photo The inverter tracks how much energy is being produced. Image: Ari Tuhkanen / Yle \n\u201cI want to store the electricity that\u2019s produced during the day so that we can use it in the evening and at night. Up until now, most of the electricity we\u2019ve produced has gone back to the power grid for quite a small compensation fee,\u201d explains Juutilainen. \nFinland's energy regulator allows only small tax breaks for the installation of solar capacity by households, and excludes solar power entirely from the feed-in tariff system intended to encourage renewable energy production by offering set prices for electricity generated by some renewable sources. \nThe government has no targets for solar energy production, preferring to focus renewable energy policy on wind power, biogas and forest industry products. Keep your own power for your own use \nSolar energy storage batteries for private homes are a relatively new concept. Juutilainen\u2019s unit was installed by Helsinki city power utility Helen, which only began offering the product to homeowners late last year. The company estimates that such units can boost solar panels\u2019 capacity utilisation factor to more than 90 percent. \n\u201cWith storage, you avoid having to transfer your own production to the network, where you don\u2019t get very good compensation, and there are no signs that you will be able to do so within the foreseeable future,\u201d says Kristiina Siilin, project manager at Helen. \nThe nominal storage capacity of Helen\u2019s solar electricity packages ranges from six to 16 kilowatt-hours (kWh). \nSeveral other storage unit alternatives for small houses are available on the Finnish market. For instance Naps Solar Systems, also based in Helsinki, sells batteries with a capacity of 4-16 kWh. Meanwhile an Espoo firm, Eaton, plans to bring units with 4.2-9.5 kWh storage capacity onto the market this year. \n\u201cThe batteries are the same as those used in Nissan cars,\u201d notes Pasi Pesonen, an executive at the company. \nStory continues after photo The storage unit fits in beside a coat-rack. Image: Ari Tuhkanen / Yle \nThe Juutilainens\u2019 storage unit is about the height and width of a large refrigerator, but only 25 cm deep. The storage unit must always be set up in a warm indoor location. The control unit is on a wall in the front hall, along with the inverter, which gauges how much energy is coming in. Ecological, not financial reasons \nThe Juutilainens have invested about 20,000 euros in their solar system, and have not made exact calculations as to how long it will take to pay for itself. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t dared to figure that out, because I guess that it probably won\u2019t pay off for at least 20 years. The usage costs are nil, though,\u201d says Juutilainen. \nSiilin acknowledges that buying solar panels and a storage unit does not yet make sense in purely financial terms. \n\u201cThe fact that you save on electricity transfer fees and taxes is not enough to make it profitable within the equipment\u2019s lifetime, but generally the values in these investments come from somewhere else besides the payback time,\u201d says Siilin. \nFor Juutilainen, the investment was motivated by a desire for more environmentally sound energy production. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it for business reasons but for ecological reasons. I also wanted to show the others in our housing association that they could install one of these, too,\u201d says Juutilainen. Prices set to drop \nElectricity storage units are still new, expensive products, so sales have been minimal so far. For instance, Helen has only sold a few of them. \n\u201cThere are several installations underway and several other customers are interested. But we expect sales to pick up,\u201d says Siilin. \nNaps Solar Systems says it has installed about 10 storage units for detached houses in the Uusimaa region so far. \n\u201cAt the moment, these are being bought by people who're interested in technology and those who want to produce their own energy,\u201d says sales director Markus Andersen, who also chairs the Finnish solar technology association. \nGrowth expectations are high at Naps too, though. \n\u201cWithin two years, buying solar panels and electricity storage units will become financially viable and demand will rise significantly,\u201d predicts Andersen, based on price trends for solar electricity systems and developments in battery technology.

The topic of the seminar was one of the most complex cross-border transactions in Finnish industrial history, where Konecranes acquired the MHPS Business from Terex after the parties had replaced the Business Combination Agreement signed in August 2015 with a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement signed in May 2016. \nThe speakers, who had central roles throughout the eventful transaction, discussed the key business points and the strategies which helped Konecranes to succeed when Zoomlion surfaced as a bidder for Terex in the middle of the process. \nRainer Hilli , Chairman of the Board at Roschier, opened the event, after which Christoph Vitzthum , Chairman of the Board of Konecranes, gave his opening remarks. Stig Gustavson , Past Chairman of the Board of Konecranes and Chairman of the Konecranes/Terex Transaction Team, explained the background to the transaction.

Simpson , Partner and Co-Head of Global Transactions Practice at Skadden; Ivan A. Schlager , Partner and Head of CFIUS at Skadden; and Jan-Anders Wik , Partner at Roschier, went through the transaction timeline and the key legal points. \nThe seminar ended with an interesting panel discussion on the lessons learned, strategy and key business points of the transaction. The panel, consisting of Christoph Vitzthum, Panu Routila and Stig Gustavson elaborated further on the topic and answered questions from the audience. The discussion was moderated by Arash Massoudi, the M&A and corporate finance correspondent at the Financial Times based in London. \nAfter the seminar, Fredrik Rydin , Managing Partner of Roschier, thanked the speakers and the audience and invited the guests to continue the evening over some food and drinks on the top floor of the new office.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zoomlion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stig gustavson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christoph vitzthum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer hilli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panu routila", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "konecranes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board of konecranes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konecranes/terex transaction team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skadden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roschier", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T15:56:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1f6dc1bdac220df87479fbc8d6127296694255b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neP67qkArV23KvbbwaD8RM.r_5HVg9fFfzqvk82ufXhlP74CNabZo4KThIlzvEYOlgmD27sjCLa7w--", "site_full": "yle.fi", "site": "yle.fi", "site_section": "http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yle News | Tuoreimmat uutiset", "title": "Elderly increasingly targeted by fraud", "title_full": "Elderly increasingly targeted by fraud", "published": "2018-03-23T12:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article10050740.ece/ALTERNATES/w940h529/rollaattori%20vanhus%20muistisairas%20el%C3%A4kel%C3%A4inen%20seniori%20vanhainkoti.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1f6dc1bdac220df87479fbc8d6127296694255b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neP67qkArV23KvbbwaD8RM.r_5HVg9fFfzqvk82ufXhlP74CNabZo4KThIlzvEYOlgmD27sjCLa7w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T12:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Elderly increasingly targeted by fraud", "text": "updated 23.3.2018 15:36 Elderly increasingly targeted by fraud Helsinki police warn that con artists are getting ever more brazen in their efforts defraud older people of money and valuables. Image: AOP \nThe elderly being conned out of their money and jewelry is nothing new. What is new, though, is how brazen criminals have become in exploiting the trust of older people. \nSwindlers have expanded their range of fictitious professional guises beyond the well-known police imposters to include fake social workers, taxi drivers, bank officers, nurses, and repairmen. \nLast week, police in eastern Uusimaa warned the public of frauds targeting the elderly. On Friday, Helsinki police issued a similar warning. \n\"There have been close to 20 cases. They are being investigated as a number of different crimes, including theft, attempted aggravated theft, fraud, payment fraud, minor fraud and attempted fraud,\" Helsinki Police Detective Chief Inspector Kari Martikainen told Yle. \nThese cons have netted perpetrators bank cards, cash, jewelry and bank account security codes. Targeted at shopping centres \nA new trend among these criminals is to use various pretexts to approach elderly people at shopping centres and to follow them home. \nOnce there, the swindler, often impersonating an official or professional some some sort, presents a plausible story to gain entrance and rifle through the senior's belongings. \nOne woman suspected of conning elderly people once used the ruse of offering free incontinence products. Another time, she claimed to need to check a victim's medical alert phone, and once requested money for a medical monitoring bracelet. \n\"They are well behaved the whole time, none of these elderly people have said they were pressured,\" relates Kari Martikainen. \nAccording to Martikainen, the suspects have been fluent Finnish, or in some cases, Swedish speakers. \nPolice recently took two women into custody on suspicion of carrying out these kinds of scams. Both have confessed to some of the charges. \nMartikainen has advice for people involved with care for the elderly about how to protect them from being exploited. \n\"We urge professionals who work with the elderly, as well as volunteers, to be alert to this and to tell seniors about the danger of getting conned.

Protesters at the March 24 event Image: Kimmo Hiltunen / Yle \nIntense discussion of nursery teacher wages in Finland snowballed into a protest in Helsinki on Saturday. A citizens' group that calls itself \"Ei en\u00e4\u00e4 leikkirahaa (No more play money)\" was the instigator of the demonstration in early March on social media. \nThe movement was sparked by a March 5 story from the public broadcaster Yle in which the teachers' union OAJ accused the capital city municipalities of creating an unofficial \"gentleman's agreement\" to not pay higher salaries to hire competent daycare teachers, despite hundreds of vacancies and a severe shortage of skilled professionals. \nThe municipal leaders of Espoo, Helsinki, and Vantaa later denied that any such verbal agreement was in place. \n\"The pact seemed so immoral; we just had to man the barricades. People are very dissatisfied and they feel as if their wages are extremely unfair,\" said Pauliina Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, one of the organizers of the group, which received over 10,000 likes on Facebook after it was established. Average salary: 2,300 euros per month \nThe minimum monthly salary for daycare teachers in the three municipalities currently stands at around 2,300 euros. This payment is often even a few hundred euros smaller per month for workers in private daycare institutions. \nMany people at the Saturday event called for monthly wages in the sector to be raised to 3,000 euros. Some of the banners at the protest read \"A calling doesn't pay the bills\", in reference to arguments that wages have remained low because people tend to think that people who pursue daycare work do so because they answer a calling to their vocation. \nThe union of daycare teachers in Finland has called for a salary increase to 3,000 euros to match that of teachers in primary and secondary schools, and the OAJ has concurred. \n\"Daycare teachers carry out demanding and valuable work that not only benefits the children, but also the entire society,\" OAJ chair Olli Luukkainen said in statement in support of the demonstration on Friday. Future of early childhood education at stake \nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4 said she was pleased that the demonstration attracted so many participants. She says it will give her group the impetus to continue the fight until daycare wages are improved. \nJari Miettinen was one of the people drawn to the protest. He changed careers and abandoned his work as a daycare teacher after he burned out. He says a wage increase is absolutely necessary if Finland wants to develop early childhood education appropriately. \n\"We need a bigger wage so people will listen to us. If daycare teachers earned 3,000 euros a month, we would be better noticed. Only then would we really be able to press for children's best interests,\" he said.

Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nOn 23 March the Parliamentary house opens its doors to 400 students of lower secondary schools across Finland for Youth Parliament day. The event is held once every two years, with 2018 marking the 11th Youth Parliament Day. \nThe Youth Parliament is organised in cooperation between the Parliament of Finland and the Development Centre Opinkirjo. It is the culmination of parliamentary club activities in schools for 15 to 16 year-olds and has been organised since 1998. \nBlack jeans and smart shirts are expected to be sported for the formal event as 15-year old Julietta Nylund walks the steps up to Parliament with a question for the ministers in mind. \nThe question is no small undertaking, as the parliament club of Helsinki\u2019s Porolahti lower secondary school have mulled over the issue since the start of the year. Topics of residency, poverty, and of course the presidential election have been suggested. \nNylund and Olavi Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, another parliamentary club comrade, are avid followers of politics who regularly tune into the evening news and flick through the pages of daily newspapers. \nThe teens enjoy lunchtime discussion topics of world politics and Finnish news at school, but admit the conversations are fairly superficial. \n\u201dI would not lower the voting age limit. Many people our age have a fairly narrow view of politics,\u201d said Nylund. \nStory continues after photograph Julietta Nylund will ask ministers about expensive living conditions. Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nAbove all, the youths hope for candor from politicians. \n\u201dThey are great speakers, that part is obvious, but I wish that they would state their own opinions more clearly,\u201d said Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \nNylund on the other hand would encourage politicians to smile more. \n\u201dPoliticians look so serious. A lot of my friends have the opinion that politicians are quite stuffy with no sense of humor.\u201d A step from schools to politics \nPoliticians will have a chance to hone their facial skills as a record number of students participate in this year\u2019s Parliamentary Youth day. A total of 154 schools will get the chance to send a student representative, as well as one journalism student and one club director. \n\u201dThe new curriculum promotes getting involved and being an influencer, and it shows,\u201d said Tiina Karhuvirta, senior advisor and Youth Parliament organizer at Development Centre Opinkirjo. \nAccording to Karhuvirta, in past years the relationship between schools and politicians has been at times an issue of wary caution, as some teachers still feel reluctant to invite their district MP to their classroom. \nHowever, this mindset is a dwindling notion as the younger generation of teachers approach the topic with progress in mind. \n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that old traumas hamper my job. Civics studies is such a fruitful subject when looking at the development of the real world,\u201d said Laura Parikka, civics teacher at Porolahti school. \nStory continues after photograph Mikael Mikkonen dreams of a politician and musician's career.

A student at Vesala upper secondary school, Mikkonen joined the parliamentary club as soon as it started up. \nMikkonen knows he is the school's odd bird because of his strong political opinions. \n\u201cConservative and Christian values are close to my heart. Home, religion, the mother country, and the preservation of these three are of great importance to me.\u201d \nIn current affairs, Mikkonen has focused on the politics of immigration and economic policies. The progress of Sote, the social and healthcare reform, is also of interest. \n\u201cIt feels like such a maze,\u201d said Mikkonen on the topic of Sote, \u201cI can\u2019t really keep up. But it is interesting to follow.\u201d \nWhile Mikkonen himself is a socially conscious individual, he ponders how politicians could reach the youths of this day and age. \n\u201cPoliticians should go to the youth, go to where they are and read the climate of what\u2019s going on. If they only hang around campaign tents, they will only meet the adult voters.\u201d \nStory continues after photograph Mikael Mikkonen will represent Vesala school in the Youth Parliamentary day. Image: Kalevi Rytk\u00f6l\u00e4 / Yle \nWhen asked about his question for the ministers, Mikkonen said it was one which echoed his own values. \n\u201cThe intention is to ask about Christian traditions in schools and daycares. It is not an attack against any minority, but it really is a disservice to immigrants if we\u2019re constantly toning down our own traditions. It also makes integration more difficult.\u201d \nAfter the question hour planned for the teens, Mikkonen has said he plans to do a bit of networking and hopes he will have a chance to talk with a few cabinet ministers. \n\u201cI hope I could meet Laura Huhtasaari and P\u00e4ivi R\u00e4s\u00e4nen.

It would be disbursed to those who are entitled to unemployment benefits. \nThe task force also argues that the basic security would increase predictability and work incentives by introducing an activity-based supplement and harmonising the concepts and calculation rules of social security benefits. The basic security would decrease as the recipient\u2019s earnings increased but never to the extent that working becomes not worthwhile. \n\u201cThe incentives would be considerably better than the current ones. The proposal would increase social assistance costs by no more than six million euros,\u201d the task force tells. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juho saari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juha sipil\u00e4", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T18:03:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4c0e953c672464a1a6e7f7acb387467362f7e18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neUX6vo5sKrfHjkjUQadjObNums0pZxrjgkYmBonPtvqMMwFAyrFDFBovn9wD8H9rlfVFZe4sbhX._Bw9FesHw3uMHQyN8Epy7uiEAbBg6dQ2fvbendWtODC05141ANLkA-", "site_full": "yle.fi", "site": "yle.fi", "site_section": "http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yle News | Tuoreimmat uutiset", "title": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "title_full": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "published": "2018-03-22T16:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/article10128990.ece/ALTERNATES/w940h529/Jan%20Vapaavuori%20Helsingin%20pormestari%2020180206%20IMG_5079%20EDIT.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2555, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4c0e953c672464a1a6e7f7acb387467362f7e18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRInRBPslGLIkgfGNwDsjksPAxvVmaN.neUX6vo5sKrfHjkjUQadjObNums0pZxrjgkYmBonPtvqMMwFAyrFDFBovn9wD8H9rlfVFZe4sbhX._Bw9FesHw3uMHQyN8Epy7uiEAbBg6dQ2fvbendWtODC05141ANLkA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T16:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care", "text": "updated 22.3.2018 16:44 Municipal leaders up in arms amid projected \u20ac300m cuts to social and health care Finland's most populous province, Uusimaa, faces 300 million euros in budget cuts as part of a planned reform of health and social care. Image: Antti Kolppo / Yle \nMunicipal leaders and decision-makers of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa are pressing hard for changes to the government's planned reform of social and health care, known as ' sote ', as the full scale of funding cuts in the country's most populous region becomes clear. \nSome 300 million euros in spending cuts are projected in the government's preferred model, which aims to expand competition and private provision in healthcare while simultaneously transferring responsibility for it from municipalities to newly-created regional governments to be elected this year. \n\u201dThis kind of planned overhaul is not good. People haven't understood all the risks [involved],\u201d said Juha Metso, Espoo's director of basic social services. \nMarkus Syrj\u00e4inen, Espoo city council's Director of Finance and Administration, produced figures this week projecting that the Uusimaa province, which includes the Helsinki area, will face a 300-million-euro shortfall in the first year of the new system. \nThe figure includes transitional expenses that would accompany the shift away from municipal responsibility for providing health care. Another portion is made up of the increasing demand for services by an ageing population. As thousands of new residents flock to the Helsinki region each year, health and social care provision must grow in proportion. \nLeaders in the Helsinki metropolitan area have said that such transitional costs had not been taken into account in calculations made by the Ministry of Finance. Hunting for cuts \nLeading the rebellion is Jan Vapaavuori, the National Coalition Party Mayor of Helsinki who has declared trenchant opposition to the reform advanced by the government coalition that includes his own party. Vapaavuori's power base is strong, with some 30,000 people voting for him in the last municipal elections, and his party includes other critics of the reform including liberal-minded MP Elina Lepom\u00e4ki . \nTheir critique is two-pronged. The new regional governments, which are dear to the rural Centre Party , have no tax-raising powers and therefore no incentive to reduce costs. Private providers, meanwhile, could be incentivised to cherry-pick young, healthy customers and leaver the older, sicker and more expensive patients for public providers to pick up. \nThe chunk of money cut from budgets in the Uusimaa region will be the most substantial due to its population of 1.6 million--nearly a third of the total population of Finland. \nMunicipal leaders interviewed by Yle estimate that of the 300-million-euro deficit that Uusimaa will face, Helsinki will have to cough up 100 million euros per year, Espoo 50 million, and Vantaa 40 million euros. The remainder would be left for the rest of Uusimaa to come up with. \n\u201dThe equivalent to losing 100 million euros per year in Helsinki would be giving up the entirety of child protection services. That gives you an idea of the scale that we are talking about,\u201d says Helsinki deputy mayor Hanna Vesikansa. \nAccording to the Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council, the financial deficit would decrease over time, but not by much. In 2030 the deficit would still be 100 million euros for the entire Uusimaa region. Baby steps \nThe Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council have agreed with government officials that weekly negotiations will be held to thrash out funding issues. In addition, the leaders of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area said the transition should be carried out with patience and in baby steps. \n\u201dThis should be done in the same manner as the primary education reform was done back in the day. Start from small provinces and proceed step by step,\u201d said Ritva Viljanen, mayor of Vantaa.

Image: Derrick Frilund / Yle \nA citizens\u2019 initiative calling on the government to reverse a Helsinki city decision to build housing on the current location of the Malmi Airport was thrown out of the Parliament on Wednesday. \nMPs did not vote on the motion as Speaker Paula Risikko ruled that the proposal was essentially unconstitutional. \nLate last year, the citizens\u2019 initiative ran into a hurdle when Parliament\u2019s Constitutional Law Committee deemed that reversing the decision by Helsinki city authorities would be unconstitutional, because it would fetter municipal sovereignty. \nLex Malmi, as it came to be known, roiled the parliament and the government during last spring\u2019s local government elections and also spawned a grassroots movement to reverse the decision to build housing on the site of the historic airfield. \nAt the time, Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4 even said that his administration would be willing to step in to preserve the location for light aviation on certain conditions. The main criterion would be finding a suitable area in the city to construct much-needed housing by way of a land swap. Appeals point to cultural importance \nCritics of the plan to construct homes on the airfield have pointed to its historical significance. Completed in 1938, the terminal building designed by architects Dag Englund and Vera Rosendahl is considered a prime example of functionalist architecture. \nIn 2016, the state withdrew its support for the light aircraft airport. Once state airports operator Finavia halted operations at the airfield, the Malmi Airfield Association stepped in to maintain the facility, which is an important site for pilot training. \nThe City of Helsinki has zoned the area for residential development for 25,000 residents. If this scale of housing development were to be implemented, the airfield would not be able to continue in operation. \nOther efforts to preserve the airfield included declaring it a site of historical and cultural significance. On 16 March 2016, Europe's leading cultural heritage organisation Europa Nostra selected Malmi Airport as one of the seven most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe.
