Nony Basco, ABS-CBN News/file photo \nMANILA- Architect and urban planner Felino \"Jun\" Palafox on Saturday criticized the plan to build a casino-resort in Boracay island amid government's efforts to rehabilitate the top tourist destination. \nPalafox said construction should not be allowed on Boracay's white-sand beaches since it will damage the quality of the sand. \n\"It might be the wrong land use at the wrong place at the wrong time on a personal basis and a professional basis,\" Palafox told ANC.

Palace defends $500-M casino-resort plan in Boracay \nBoracay tourism stakeholders have also expressed dismay over the planned casino construction. \nBoracay Foundation board member Connie Helgen said the island, known for its picturesque waters and sunsets, should not be marketed as a gambling destination. \n\"Boracay island is for beach lovers. Boracay is a wholesome destination. Why go to Boracay to play casino? There are so many casinos in Manila and in Macau,\" Helgen said. \nThe government has tapped Palafox's team to help rehabilitate Boracay during the planned shutdown of the island. \nPalafox is proposing a rehabilitation plan which features more eco-friendly structures. \nIf he was to have his way, Palafox said it might be better to build the casino on the mainland in the town of Malay in Aklan. \nThe veteran architect also agreed that there should be a limit to the number of tourists allowed in Boracay. \n\"So many plans have been done in Boracay but the institutions are not in place and there is issue of governance in all hierarchy of government,\" he said. \nThree government agencies have recommended the closure of Boracay island to tourists starting April 26 to give way to rehabilitation efforts. \nThe cleanup comes after President Rodrigo Duterte's criticism of the tourist destination's environmental woes.

Well, one, because this writer loves going to comic conventions when time permits and loves anything involving superheroes. Another reason is that it\u2019s raking in a lot of controversy from netizens, and the event is already happening tomorrow until Sunday.\nWe\u2019re not saying that it\u2019s ultimately a bad event that everyone should boycott altogether. People might still have fun with the activities, find something cool at the booths, and even meet their favorite celebrities. At the same time, you just can\u2019t ignore the ire of people who were either inconvenienced by the event or just observant netizens airing out their concerns. So allow us to break down some of them.\nManny Pacquiao as event ambassador Sen. Manny Pacquiao makes strong pitch as patron of Comicon Asia in Manila on March 2018, showcasing the best in cosplay, gaming, comics, movies, anime and toys. | via @mariovdumaual pic.twitter.com/hzHe55Qnik\n\u2014 ABS-CBN News Channel (@ANCALERTS) January 17, 2018\nWhen ComicCon Asia was revealed last year, they named Sen. Manny Pacquiao as one of their main ambassadors . Apparently because he starred as a superhero that one time in 2009\u2019s Wapakman. Although he isn\u2019t sponsoring the event, the organizers still expressed that his presence will be \u201cinstrumental in presenting the Philippines to foreign exhibitors and investors as \u2018[the] destination of choice for international conventions.'\u201d\nStill, this announcement struck a nerve to many people because of Pacquiao\u2019s views on same-sex marriage , among other issues. One of them was comics artist Gerry Alinguilan, who canceled his appearance at the convention because of the senator\u2019s involvement. \u201cI cannot forget the statements made by Manny Pacquiao in the past. He called same sex couples worse than animals. Worse, in a now deleted Instagram post, he posted Bible Quote: s that preach that gays should be put to death. As someone who believes in equality for all, I find these statements reprehensible and dangerous. Dangerous because Manny Pacquiao is in a position of political power that would enable him to make his personal beliefs a matter of national policy. That is something I cannot abide,\u201d he said in his blog .\nA questionable copyright clause and here's the fucked up part: they're holding a contest called project x where participants submit ideas for new pinoy superheroes. the catch? oh they just get perpetual rights to the winner's creation which THEY can profit off of and the winners won't be able to sue them for it pic.twitter.com/NitzFGQLz7\n\u2014 \ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcbd | the evil is defeated (@thranduilien) January 15, 2018\nComicCon Asia is holding a contest called \u201c Project X ,\u201d which encourages Filipinos to create original superheroes. According to the Terms and Conditions, all copyright goes to the participant. But the catch is that the organizers will also get the rights to use the character for reproduction and distribution, and they can profit from the creation. Although they will properly credit the participant, people still find it a bit sketchy that the organizers will get money out of someone else\u2019s original work.\nHayley Atwell\u2019s cancellation A post shared by Hayley Atwell (@wellhayley) on Mar 22, 2018 at 7:51am PDT\nAgent Carter star Hayley Atwell recently called off her appearance at the convention , but the reasons were conflicting. The initial statement that ComicCon Asia released said that she canceled due to the \u201cpolitical unrest\u201d in the country. However, Hayley clarified that it was not her words and that the real reason was her work schedule. The same reason she gave when she turned down AsiaPOP Comicon Manila in 2016 .\nBecause of this, people are asking why ComicCon Asia made the assumption and why they made it political. Most especially after presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that it was \u201cher loss\u201d for canceling and that there\u2019s no political unrest here. (Let\u2019s be real: there is .) As of writing, there\u2019s still no statement from the organizers regarding the issue.\nFranco Mabanta is one of the hosts Shame for organizers of ComicCon Asia for choosing Manny Pacquiao, a known bigot and DDS Senator, as the event\u2019s ambassador. And also Franco Mabanta, a BBM/DDS propagandist, as emcee?!\nCome on guys, you can do better!\n\u2014 Ted Pylon (@TedPylon) March 22, 2018\nSome netizens aren\u2019t happy about Franco Mabanta\u2019s presence, mostly because of the contents of his Facebook page . Another reason we\u2019re putting out there is that he made fun of the #MeToo movement and called Jover Laurio of Pinoy Ako Blog an \u201cOgre Lady.\u201d So we\u2019re giving a thumbs down for this part.\nProblems with refunds\nDue to the cancellations of Stan Lee and Hayley Atwell, several fans asked for refunds. Yesterday, ComicCon Asia released instructions that all refunds can be claimed on March 24 and 25, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. This raised a few concerns like if they\u2019re giving back the payment in cash or check. Those who won\u2019t attend the event also asked if there\u2019s another option.\nMeanwhile, many aren\u2019t pleased that it took ComicCon Asia a week to address the Stan Lee refunds. ( He canceled on March 16 .) Fans said that they were told by a certain \u201cAnthony\u201d that their refunds will deposited to their bank accounts. They said that they\u2019ve given their details but nothing has happened. (To be honest, it\u2019s also very sketchy that they asked for personal bank details.)\nWhat do you think?

Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News \nMANILA - Nearly three decades and some 16,000 liposuction procedures later, beauty doctor to the stars Vicki Belo said she still gets excited drawing fat from clients to reveal a sexier and more confident frame, drawing from her own struggles with insecurity. \nLiposuction is still one of the most popular treatments at Belo Medical Group, where 30 percent involve going under the knife and 70 percent are non-surgical. By her own account, Belo said she spent 45,000 hours doing liposuction. \n\"My tip is always find what you love to do, so you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re working. Like ako, I get excited pa rin to do a liposuction. If it makes you a happier person, then I\u2019ve done my calling. It\u2019s a vocation,\" Belo told ABS-CBN News. \nBelo credits late 90s bombshell Rosanna Roces for destroying taboos over liposuction. The sex symbol turned liposuction into a status symbol, she said. \n\"Rosanna Roces was my turning point when you ask when did you become more popular,\" Belo said. \n\"She went on TV and she\u2019s so maingay. 'Nagpa-lipo ako kay Dra Belo, sosyal 'yan at mayaman. Ako kasi nakapunta ako dyan,'\" she said. \n(She went on TV and she's so loud that 'I had lipo with Dr Belo, who is a rich socialite. I go to her.') Beauty doctor to the stars Vicki Belo is shown in one of her clinics on the sidelines of an interview with ABS-CBN News. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News \nINSPIRATION \nBullied as a child for being fat and adopted, Belo said she channeled such insecurities into building her business, which now has 13 branches. \n\"Other kids would ask 'Why did they give you away, because you\u2019re fat?'. Then other kids would say \u2018No, she\u2019s not fat, she\u2019s just ugly'. They would do that to me and I would cry,\" Belo told ABS CBN News. \n\"So the message that came to me was 'Ah ganon pala \u2018yon' (that's how it is), if you\u2019re fat and you\u2019re ugly they give you away,'\" she said. \nShe said she struggled with acne from when she was 11 until she reached 26, even during medical school. \n\"Sabi ko, 'pretty girls don\u2019t know what it feels like, eh ako I have suffered all my life,' so I have empathy and I really want to be the best anti-acne doctor in the world,\" she said. \nBelo counts singer Regine Velasquez as one of her earlier clients, whose back acne problem she cured. How Belo beauty empire started with Regine Velasquez, pimple fight \n\"If somebody tells me not to do it, then the more I want to do it. So if somebody said 'You can\u2019t be a derma because your skin is bad.' I\u2019ll say 'No, I can!',\" she said. \nA constant figure in society pages, Belo got married late last year to fellow doctor Hayden Kho in opulent style in Paris. \nThe couple's 3-year-old daughter, Scarlet Snow, is an Instagram celebrity.

There were feelings between the two of us,\" she said.\nThe pair met in 2006, shortly after Trump's wife Melania gave birth to their son Baron.\nTrump only mentioned Melania once, and \"obviously, there's a reason I don't bring her up, because I felt guilty about it,\" McDougal said.\nWhile the alleged affair dates to 2006, the agreement with American Media Inc was only made in 2016, when Trump was running for the presidency.\nMcDougal's story echoes allegations of an affair between Trump and the porn actress Stephanie Clifford -- known as Stormy Daniels -- during the same period.\nDaniels has filed suit seeking to be released from a non-disclosure agreement she signed in 2016, for which she was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal lawyer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bullit marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdougal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen mcdougal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national enquirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american media inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asean", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly hills hotel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T07:40:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b2fcfd79f6d7fcc07b96499b5a9890567aa27ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4I6hQcrRk5uLzwsmwnkwf85c8JMY4vQ3yFfPQPDfrLotQE3JSVFrv4xTTXIbSfOYVkZAe8hUO0Mh25BC709I8.nxMmOmusMc5", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://news.abs-cbn.com/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business | ABS-CBN News ", "title": "3 Tips for a Stress-Free Driver\u2019s License Renewal", "title_full": "3 Tips for a Stress-Free Driver\u2019s License Renewal | ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-22T03:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.408, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/news/03/23/121816_license.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5950, "comments": 0, "shares": 5950}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b2fcfd79f6d7fcc07b96499b5a9890567aa27ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4I6hQcrRk5uLzwsmwnkwf85c8JMY4vQ3yFfPQPDfrLotQE3JSVFrv4xTTXIbSfOYVkZAe8hUO0Mh25BC709I8.nxMmOmusMc5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MoneyMax.ph", "published": "2018-03-22T03:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "3 Tips for a Stress-Free Driver\u2019s License Renewal", "text": "3 Tips for a Stress-Free Driver\u2019s License Renewal MoneyMax.ph Posted at Mar 23 2018 05:48 AM \nShare Facebook \nMANILA - Renewing one's driver's license is inescapable, but it should be easier compared to applying for a new one. \nIs your driver's license up for renewal?

That changed last month when she was branded a \"terrorist\" by President Rodrigo Duterte's government. \nThe special advisor to the United Nations on indigenous rights since 2014 was among 600 people accused of terrorism over their alleged links to Maoist rebels in a government document filed in a Manila court in February. \nThe activist, who had condemned alleged rights abuses in the southern Mindanao region where the state is battling an Islamic insurgency and leftist guerrillas, denies the allegations and says she feels like a marked woman. \n\"This is like a target list basically,\" the slightly built, bespectacled 65-year-old from the Kankanaey Igorot ethnic group said in an interview at the UN cultural body UNESCO in Paris. \nWhile waiting to see if the state brings charges, she said she has decided to stay out of the Philippines on the advice of her lawyers. \nTauli-Corpuz is one of several left-wing activists accused by Duterte's government of links to the Maoist rebels with whom he broke off talks last year, after initially saying he would \"walk the extra mile\" for peace. \nDuterte blamed the rebels, whose insurgency has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since 1969, for ongoing attacks on the security forces. \n'Virtual hit list' \nIn its court petition, the justice department asked for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), to be declared \"terrorist organisations\". \nAttached to the submission, seen by AFP, were 600 names of suspected rebels, including Tauli-Corpuz and two other prominent indigenous leaders -- Joan Carling and Jose Molintas -- who have previously advised the United Nations. \nThe targeting of the trio came after Duterte last year accused indigenous Lumad schools of grooming children to become insurgents and threatened to bomb them. \nReacting to the case, U.N. rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said it was \"unacceptable for a special rapporteur acting on behalf of the international community whose expertise is sought by the (U.N.) Human Rights Council to be treated in this way\". \nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said those on the \"virtual government hit list\" were \"at grave risk\". \nTauli-Corpuz, who began campaigning for indigenous rights in her native Cordillera region during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, compared the government list to the lists of suspects used to prosecute Duterte's deadly anti-drugs war. \nPhilippine police say they have killed more than 4,000 drug suspects who resisted arrest, but rights groups estimate there have been more than three times that, including people murdered by vigilante groups. \n\"The president has his police and his death squads who can easily kill people whom they accuse of being terrorists,\" Tauli-Corpuz said. \n'Embarrassing the government' \nThe activist who helped draft the seminal 2007 U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples said she believed she was targeted over her condemnation in December of alleged rights abuses in the southern region of Mindanao, where Duterte is battling pro-Islamic State gunmen. \n\"They (indigenous people) are being displaced, they are being killed, their lands are being taken over, so I made a statement which came out in the newspapers and the government immediately came out and said I was embarrassing the government internationally,\" she said. \nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has insisted there is evidence linking Tauli-Corpuz to the rebels and said she and others on the list \"should see this as an opportunity to clear their names\". \nDuterte, who enjoys wide popularity despite his rights record, has repeatedly lashed out at his domestic and foreign critics. \nLast week, he announced he was pulling the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court, which is examining his crackdown on drugs. \nHe also recently vowed not to cooperate with the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, Agnes Callamard. \n\"You're investigating us, fact finding? Well sorry, do not f*** with me,\" he said, in remarks aimed at Callamard. \nShare ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/03/23/18/un-expert-at-grave-risk-in-philippines&text=U.N.%20expert%20"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vicky tauli-c", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tauli-corpuz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines victoria tauli-corpuz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mindanao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kankanaey igorot", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:51:38.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b53a177b299da1516d6c8022ad0b08ce974ad886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4jm8RaR3bLqKuWrKVtT_W_qdBwirHnNB6RR.1F7sWdRe8oFOW.lNGf5da3cnSL6RddIyiceD41aIY7IYbNXFqzyNkOogOIXsQQvQ9e002zT4LmnEKJ2T2nw--", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entertainment | ABS-CBN News ", "title": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans", "title_full": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans | ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-21T22:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/tvpatrol/03/20/hayley-atwell.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3336, "comments": 6, "shares": 3336}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b53a177b299da1516d6c8022ad0b08ce974ad886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4jm8RaR3bLqKuWrKVtT_W_qdBwirHnNB6RR.1F7sWdRe8oFOW.lNGf5da3cnSL6RddIyiceD41aIY7IYbNXFqzyNkOogOIXsQQvQ9e002zT4LmnEKJ2T2nw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABS-CBN News", "published": "2018-03-21T22:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "'In my own words': Hayley Atwell pens letter to Pinoy ComicCon fans", "text": "\"Agent Carter\" star Hayley Atwell has penned a letter to Filipino fans -- \"in my own words\" -- after ComicCon Asia announced that she had cancelled her appearance at the weekend event, citing \"political unrest.\" Mar 6, 2018 at 5:05am PST \nThe British actress shared the letter on Instagram Thursday, with the caption: \"My statement.

Photo by author MANILA -- Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen is one of the most loved restaurants in Tagaytay. People line up just to have their fill of authentic Vietnamese food. And since it's only open from Thursday to Sunday, days when Tagaytay is brimming with tourists, diners find it difficult to get a table.\nFortunately, guests who come all the way from Manila, don't need to travel to Tagaytay to satisfy their Bawai's food cravings. Because unknown to a lot of the restaurant's loyal patrons, it actually opened a branch at the ground floor of Uptown Parade in Taguig last year.\n\u201cPeople are surprised we have a branch in BGC,\u201d shared Bawai's owner Virgilio \u201cVer\u201d Tatlonghari.\nThe interiors of Bawai's at Uptown Parade. Photo by author The Tatlonghari family partnered with businessman Anderson Hao, his wife Rhea, and their business partners to open a branch in one of the metro's central business districts. They did not do a formal media launch back then that's why diners were unaware of the new location.\nApart from the branches in Tagaytay and Taguig, Bawai's is also in Nuvali in Sta. Rosa in Laguna, and another one along Katipunan Ave. in Quezon City.\nThis family business is going big, planning to branch out to other areas in Metro Manila. And this success all started from humble beginnings.\nVer Tatlonghari and wife My or more fondly called \u201cBawai Dung\u201d started the restaurant in 2007 after friends and family gave them an idea to offer their home-cooked meals to the public. Bawai Dung is from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and even formally studied Vietnamese cooking in 2006.\n(From left) Anderson Hao and wife Rhea, Bawai Dung and Ver Tatlonghari. Photo by author \"Bawai\" translates to grandmother and the restaurant was named after the family's matriarch because all the recipes come from her.\n\u201cAfter I finished my formal Vietnamese culinary education, I was ready to share my personal recipes. We sought help of our neighbors and their families, trained them to be our cooks, servers, and staff. Then, we opened Bawai's Vietnamese Kitchen right in our home in Tagaytay in 2007,\u201d Bawai Dung recalled.\nIt was a small operation back then. The couple converted part of their home into a small restaurant with 36 seats, serving lunch and dinner from Friday to Sunday. Soon, the news spread around Tagaytay about this small restaurant that serves delicious authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Then people, from tourists to politicians, started flocking to the Vietnamese eatery.\nToday, the Tagaytay restaurant expanded its business, opening more tables in the garden area to accommodate more guest and including Thursdays in their weekly operations. The whole family is now involved in the growing business including the couple's five children.\nThe Uptown branch has a seating capacity of 50 guests. It has modern and simple interior with a striking Vietnamese mural on one wall.\nPho Bo or traditional Vietnamese beef noodle soup. Photo by author The menu is the same as the original restaurant. To keep everything authentic, the ingredients are mostly sourced from suppliers in Tagaytay and Vietnam as well. Most sauces, noodles, and other specialty ingredients must be sourced from Vietnam.\n\u201cOur chef here actually trained for six months in Tagaytay before we opened,\u201d Anderson Hao explained.\nGoi Cuon or fresh spring rolls. Photo by author Must-tries are the classic Vietnamese dishes like the Goi Cuon or fresh spring rolls (vermicelli noodles, vegetables, pork, and shrimp wrapped in thin rice paper wrapper and served with peanut sauce), Banh Mi or Vietnamese sandwich, and Pho Bo or traditional Vietnamese beef noodle soup.\nCa Phe Sua Da or iced milk coffee. Photo by author They also serve Ca Phe Sua Nuong and Ca Phe Sua Da or Vietnamese hot and iced coffee. These drinks uses Vietnamese coffee and condensed milk.\nBut probably the restaurant's best dishes come from the entree menu. The Curry Ga or chicken curry is the Vietnamese version of the classic Indian dish. It has a more subtle curry flavor and perfectly seasoned with traditional spices.\nTom Rang Me or black tiger prawns in sweet tamarind paste. Photo by author The Tom Rang Me on the other hand, is pan-cooked black tiger prawns served with a flavorful sweet tamarind paste.\nThe Bo Kho is a beef stew like no other. The restaurant uses top round cut, 12 different spices, potatoes, and carrots. The stew is cooked for eight hours until the meat is fork tender and the sauce has a rich and robust flavor.\nBo Kho or Vietnamese beef stew.
