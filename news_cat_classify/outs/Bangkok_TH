Their dust emissions have exceeded \"harmful\" levels in the capital since last month. \nPM2.5 is a major concern as these particles are smaller than the width of a single human hair and bury deep inside the lungs, causing serious respiratory problems. \nThey can also \"enter veins and instigate some [negative] reactions\" causing high blood pressure and deep vein thrombosis, Disease Control Department chief Suwanchai Watthanayingcharoenchai warned Friday. \nThese conditions can lead to coronary artery disease, strokes and, in the long term, become a precursor to cancer. \nCars, mostly with diesel-powered engines, and factories contribute 52% of the pollutants in the capital, followed by 35% from outdoor burning, Mr Supat said. The rest is brought on by freak weather conditions and other sources. \nMr Supat, an air environment expert and Thammasat University lecturer, insisted Bangkok must limit the number of lorries in city areas and better cope with poorly managed traffic congestion, fuelled by the increasing number of vehicles. \nHe suggested authorities adopt a three-month measure, from February to April every year, to extend areas where lorries are allowed to run only during certain hours. \nPM2.5 levels often peak during the dry season, especially in the first few months of the year. \nIf the measure fails to curb dust levels, officials should intensify vehicle controls to cover small trucks during rush hours and even private cars. The latter with even, or odd, number plates should be barred from some city roads on alternate days, he said. \nThe ultimate solution would see a complete ban on outdoor burning especially in Bangkok's suburbs and neighbouring provinces, pundits say. \nMr Supat said more drastic efforts would be needed in the future to improve the traffic flow and better control emissions from construction sites in the capital. \nSome have called to ban temple crematoria that emit smoke.

The dog was then taken to the house on March 15. \nIt became aggressive on March 17 and bit a local resident. The dog was taken to a clinic on Monday and died on Tuesday. A test confirmed it was infected with rabies. There were four more dogs at the same house. \nRabies control zones remained in place in 25 provinces on Friday.

Known for his unapologetic political and social commentary, one should be prepared to be shocked by his colourful yet graphic works that communicate his social responsibility towards the community and the nation. With sarcasm, satire and implicit comparisons, this may be one of the most controversial exhibitions the BACC has ever hosted. \"I Am You\" is a retrospective from the artists' works from 1975 to the present day, split into five topics: \"Ideals And Ideology\", \"Powerful Vs Powerless\", \"Raw Aesthetic As A Weapon\", \"Face, Figure and Liberty\", and \"Protest And Making The World A Better Place\". In this political climate, we'll have to see if the exhibition will even last the week. \"I Am You\" is exhibited on the 8th Floor, BACC, until May 27, 2018. For more information, go to bacc.or.th.

(Reuters file photo) - + FUKUSHIMA, Japan: Fishery workers in Fukushima were shocked and saddened after an event serving fish from the northeastern Japan prefecture was cancelled in Bangkok earlier this month due to strong opposition from a local consumer group. The cancellation, made despite the fish having obtained Thai health authorities' safety approval, highlights the difficulty faced by the region in convincing consumers about the safety of its food products even seven years after it was devastated by the 2011 killer tsunami and ensuing nuclear disaster. \"I felt like I was pushed down the stairs,\" said Kanji Tachiya, a fishery cooperative official in the prefecture, referring to his feelings when learning about the news from Bangkok. A dish using flatfish from Fukushima, a local specialty, was supposed to be served at 11 Japanese restaurants in the Thai capital from March 10 through the end of the month in an event that would have boosted the morale of fishermen and helped Fukushima rebuild its reputation. The prefectural government had spent a year and a half preparing for the event, including inviting chefs and restaurant owners in Bangkok to a fishing port in Soma, Fukushima, to see the quality of the fish and how rigidly radiation checks are conducted. \"We are confident about the safety of our fish,\" Tachiya said. At the port, a catch of fish undergoes radiation checks with strict safety standards set by the Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations. While the Japanese government has set a maximum limit for radioactive cesium in sea produce and other food items of 100 becquerels per kilogramme, which it says is stricter than international standards, the upper limit set by the Fukushima fisheries group is 50 becquerels per kg. If fish is found to contain radioactive cesium exceeding the 50 becquerel-limit, the catch will not be shipped to market. \"We are spending time and effort on the tests. I'm very sad that the scare (about the fish) continues even though its safety is confirmed,\" said a female worker who slices fish for radiation checks. Fukushima shipped flatfish to Thailand for the aborted event, marking the first export of local fresh fish since meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"We can't just give up. We will tenaciously keep telling people of the safety and tastiness (of the local fish),\" said Takahiro Ichimura, an official of the prefectural government. The prefecture is now considering inviting Thai journalists to Fukushima so they can learn about the local fishing and radiation tests at first hand. Thailand has been the largest overseas purchaser of Fukushima fruit, including peaches and persimmons, and the prefecture has held promotional events every year in the country. While there has been no negative response to the events promoting fruit from Fukushima, officials are concerned that the cancellation of the fish-serving event could have a negative impact on fruit exports to the kingdom.

The group's industrial unit, located in Bangplee will be an investment of EUR47.4 million for the company. \nIts offices and production center together employ more than 700 staff and manufacture products for two of its brands, NIVEA and Eucerin, for the Thai market and export to 43 other countries. This expansion is reflective of the continued growth this cosmetics giant has enjoyed within the region. \nMr. Markus Daburger, Beiersdorf Thailand says: \"The Pailin Project is Beiersdorf's commitment towards doubling production performance in order to support the demand of the region. As a representative of Beiersdorf Thailand, we appreciate the on-going support of the Government and local agencies in our expansion project, which not only sees the production line expand, but also our Beiersdorf family, as up to 200 jobs new will be created in the next years. We are proud to say that the Pailin Project in Thailand is now the second biggest hub of the company after Germany.\" \nA key target of the project is to improve the working environment for all employees, with cutting-edge innovation, structured offices, optimized work ergonomics and CE-standard machines as well as a refurbishment of the existing production building. The compounding area will be renewed with four mixers replaced while the factory entrance, canteen, offices and recreation area will all be refurbished, too. \nEfficiency is also a key consideration. Line performance will be improved to see production peak at 240 bottles per minute on a single line. The expansion will include a solar-paneled roof with the capability to produce 500kW of power, and is on target to achieve a gold LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) certification. The U.S Green Building Council's prestigious certification serves as a project management tool to achieve more sustainable, high-performance green buildings. \nThe expansion, due to house new production lines for Deo Roll-Ons, has a building footprint dimension of 72m x 97m and a construction area of 9,679m2. This vast project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2019 and will begin production of Roll-Ons in the following quarter. The existing building will be refurbished to accommodate Lip Care production which will begin in the middle of 2020.
