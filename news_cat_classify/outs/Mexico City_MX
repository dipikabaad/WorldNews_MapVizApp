pesos are invested in hydroagricultural infrastructure in Yucatan Aa Aa A Merida, Mexico, Mar. 22 (Notimex).- The National Water Commission (Conagua, for its acronym in Spanish) has allocated approximately two thousand 500 million pesos in the execution of various actions in the area of \u200b\u200bdrinking water, drainage, sanitation and hydro-agricultural infrastructure in the state.\nThe director of the Basin Agency of the Yucatan Peninsula under the Conagua, Ignacio Mendicuti Priego, stressed that of these resources some 1,600 million pesos have been channeled by the government of the Republic through the body it represents.\nIn the framework of the celebrations for the World Water Day in this entity, whose motto this year is \"Nature for water\", he indicated that this level of investment was achieved thanks to the coordinated work between government and society \"which is essential to facing the challenges and problems that the water resource has not only locally but also nationally\".\nIn his speech, Mendicuti Priego said that March 22 is one of the most important dates for the water sector and \"is becoming aware of the importance of taking care of water for the benefit not only of current, but of future generations\".\n\"This year's motto tells us that efforts should also be focused on protecting and caring for the environment, because that is how we can overcome the challenges around water in the century that is running,\" he said.\nOn the other hand, on behalf of the Yucatecan governor, the head of the Department of Urban Development and Environment of Yucatan, Eduardo Batllori Sampedro, thanked the coordination that exists at all levels of government to protect and care for water in the state.\nThe director of the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks in Yucatan, Miguel \u00c1ngel Soberanis Luna, stressed that among families the application of good practices for the use of water is essential, as this not only protects the resource, but also the presence of diseases is avoided.\nThe commemorative event for the World Water Day 2018 also included the inauguration of a Water Culture Space (ECA) in the municipality of Uc\u00fa, as well as the signing of the delivery of that space to the city hall of this site.\nNTX/TAM/LTS/AEG/JCG\n259 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Easter holiday period, the Federal Commission for Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris, for its acronym in Spanish) anticipated that the quality of Mexican beaches is good for tourists to enjoy them.\nIn a press conference, after inaugurating the Symposium in Regulatory Sciences \"Contribution to the Improvement of the Health System in Mexico\", the head of the Cofepris, Julio S\u00e1nchez y T\u00e9poz, indicated that the water quality of more than 250 Mexican beaches is analyzed, and so far no indications of contamination have been found.\n\"So far we have not found any negative beach or high levels of pollution, we want to conclude the analysis and in this week we will release the results, but we can anticipate that all can be used,\" he said.\nOn the issue of the alleged poor quality of abortion pills distributed in clinics for the Legal Interruption of Pregnancy (ILE), under the Government of Mexico City, S\u00e1nchez y T\u00e9poz considered that the failure is perhaps due to an administration or misuse by of health professionals and the women who ingested it.\nAlthough he did not rule out that the more than 200 cases in which the abortion with these medications did not take place, could be a result of the range of effectiveness of the same pill.\nThe official stressed that according to the review made by Cofepris, the generic medicine Mefaprix has a current sanitary registry and bioequivalence studies, so it can continue to be used.\nNTX/MPG/MAG/JCG\n228 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Mexico City on April 21 and 22.\nTwo days, 100 buildings, seven zones and a free festival is what Open House CDMX will offer. The premise is simple, the meeting invites to celebrate the existing heritage and the architecture that is being made, to know what is behind the fa\u00e7ade, to learn to love and care for this city.\nIn a press conference, the organizers Mariela Martinez, Victoria Escalante and Mar Thomas detailed that Open House CDMX is a celebration of design and architecture in the city, is aimed at citizens to know the places that surround them.\nThis festival is an opportunity to know the buildings that are not commonly accessed. The tours will have an ally, an application called \"Iconus\", which will be launched in parallel with the festival and will help attendees obtain a map and detailed information about the buildings that are part of the Open House CDMX.\nThe seven zones that comprise the routes are the Rome-Condesa Circuit, Polanco, Pedregal-CU, Santa Maria La Ribera, Reforma Corridor, Historic Center and the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood.\nAmong the hundred buildings that can be visited are the Architecture and Design Archive, the Rivas Mercado House, the Vizca\u00ednas School, the \"Esperanza Iris\" City Theater, the Wabi House, the Mexico Fronton, the Cultural Center Rule, the Rabid Gallery, the Folkloric Ballet School of Mexico by \"Amalia Hernandez\", the Bacardi Plant and the Museum of Popular Art.\nThese sites are adapted factories, white elephants, towering towers, neighborhood gardens; spaces that make Mexico City unique. Most of these places have gone through an architectural rescue process, which provides a unique experience for visitors.\nIn addition, the celebration will have parallel programs that will enrich this experience, such as the photo competition for those attending the \"Open Photo\" event, a series of conferences with four talks about Mexico City, its identity, heritage, morphology and visions for the future.\nAs well as \"Architect on Site\", an open invitation to the architects of the participating buildings to encourage conversations on site and a market made up of several exhibitors that will offer products related to art, design and fashion.\nThe presentation of this meeting that invites to a weekend of architectural discovery, was unveiled during a press conference organized by the Polychrome Group and Open House Worldwide.\nOpen House CDMX is organized as part of the Open House Worldwide family, a global network of cities working to foster appreciation and understanding for architecture, with presence in 39 cities around the world, including London, New York, Monterrey, Barcelona and Buenos Aires.\nNTX/AGZ/ACJ/ISG\n715 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

Dom\u00ednguez Galv\u00e1n. Envoy\nMunich, Mar. 22 (Notimex).- The BMW plant in Mexico will be able to produce electric vehicles to meet the goal of the German automaker to increase its global production of electrified units to half a million in the short term.\nThe premium vehicle brand, which is in the final phase of construction of its plant in the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, installed a \"flexible\" production line, that is, with the capacity to manufacture any unit of their portfolio.\nAs part of the BMW AG Annual Results Conference, Production Manager Oliver Zipse told Notimex that the plant in Mexico will start producing the 3 Series Sedan in April 2019.\nHe stressed that although it is planned to manufacture vehicles with internal combustion, when the markets ask for it, it is possible to manufacture electric units. \"The production of fully electrified cars is not available at the moment, but it would be possible to do so\".\nRegarding the \"i\" range of BMW, electrified vehicles, the CEO of the company, Harald Kr\u00fcger, revealed that by 2020 it will be the iX3 SUV, and in 2019 the first electrified MINI will be revealed to the market.\nMeanwhile, the new BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coup\u00e9 will be available in the markets from next May, and within the framework of this strategy, the iNext that combines autonomy in driving, connectivity and electrification will be launched in 2021 .\n\"We are clear about our objectives of sustainable mobility\" and only this year the sale of 140 thousand electrified units is foreseen, and at the end of 2019 it is estimated to increase the number to half a million in the world.\nHe stressed that there are countries like Norway that have grown very important in the acquisition of electric units that in 2011 when there were no electric, now they already have a 15 percent share.\nThis, he said, is the result of the introduction of these units, but also of the facilities offered by governments and the change in the culture of society.\nIn the framework of the world conference, the spokesperson for BMWI, Paloma Brunchkhorst, said that in view of the needs for sustainable mobility of people in the world, BMW began again with its plans for people to have electric, efficient and friendly units with the environment\nShe recalled that since 2006, when no one imagined electric mobility in the world, the shipowner started with the project, at which point they realized that only electrifying the unit was unsustainable due to the weight of it.\nAnd this is how the BMWi working group \"said, as the battery is heavy, the car should not weigh much and be very agile\" and that its production is sustainable, then began to look for carbon material options.\nShe indicated that in the investigation they realized that they could produce coal with the force of water and wind energy, therefore they do it with a minimum quantity of CO2, in addition to the battery is manufactured by modules to make it functional the longest possible.\nThe vehicles also have other materials inside such as the pet, seeds and leather that are made from olive oil waste and kena plant that leaves the rivers and nobody uses, but now it is being used for the production of the i3, the all-electric BMW, he explained.\nFinally, she stressed that although the production of electric i3 is for cities, not to travel large cities, the plan of BMW is to be directed to this type of vehicles, so it makes large annual investments in research and development.\nNTX/DDG/TVA/AUTOS17/ISG\n225 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diana dom\u00ednguez galv\u00e1n", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "harald kr\u00fcg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver zipse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "notimex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san luis potos\u00ed", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T00:53:56.076+02:00"}], "totalResults": 5, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746635854&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AMX+location%3AMexico+City&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 841, "extra": {"place": "Mexico City", "country": "MX", "lat": "19.4326077", "lng": "-99.133208"}}
