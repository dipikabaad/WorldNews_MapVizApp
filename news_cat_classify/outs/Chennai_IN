We intend to bring something to the table that simply doesn\u2019t exist in India today, but is very much warranted for the India of the future,\u201d Raghuram Rajan, former RBI Governor and advisor to the Krea Governing Council, said at a press conference in Mumbai today. \nThe first batch will commence in July 2019, with admissions opening in November this year. The four-year residential undergraduate programmes in Liberal Arts and Sciences will offer immersive learning experiences through real world projects and internships to prepare the students for a holistic approach to face challenges and opportunities. \n\u201cKrea will bring great global and Indian minds together to create an institution of global prominence,\u201d said Jindal. \n\u201cThe fact that so many like-minded and eminent personalities have enthusiastically come together is ample proof of how much the new paradigm is the need of this day,\u201d said former banker and philanthropist N Vaghul, also Chairman of the governing council. \nMahindra, reiterating the value of the university, said Krea\u2019s graduates will undoubtedly be the most sought after candidates both in the corporate world and in other chosen vocations. \nCorporate leaders were unanimous that the university would enable high potential individuals learn to create a positive, catalytic impact ethically in a dynamic and diverse world. \n\u201cKrea University has a unique \u2018interwoven learning\u2019 approach that weaves creativity and action, arts and sciences, theory and practice, Eastern and Western perspectives as also the learnings of the past with the readiness for the future,\u201d said Seshasayee, chairman of the university\u2019s supervisory board.

Abhishek of Vysarpadi was riding the bike back home, after finishing the board exams at his school in north Chennai. P. Raj was riding pillion. \nCrashing into the lorry, the duo was thrown off and came under the wheels of the vehicle, and died on the spot. \nTraffic Investigation Officer Chitra said, \u201cThe parents told us that the boys did not pay heed to their words. At least the school could have prevented them from driving the vehicle to the school premises. The accident could have been prevented.\u201d \nOn March 4, a 17-year-old boy, who was riding a high-end bike, knocked down senior citizen who was walking in Tiruninravur, resulting in his death. \nOn January 12, a 16-year-old boy who took his father\u2019s bike hit a 61-year-old woman in Tirumangalam. She was badly injured. \nCause of snarls \nUnderage driving is a major cause of traffic snarls in the city and causes danger to other motorists and pedestrians on the roads. The menace continues unabated, despite efforts by police to spread awareness among students, schools and parents. \nYoung boys in school uniforms are often found driving high-end bikes in a reckless manner, criss-crossing arterial roads and exhibiting their daredevilry, say police. \nThey hide behind big cars or heavy vehicles to escape the attention of the police at signals. \nSchool girls ride bikes too, but they do not race and are not reckless, police officers said. \nM. Radhakrishnan, co-ordinator of Thozhan Foundation, an non-governmental organisation that works for traffic awareness, said, \u201cMany parents feel proud of their children driving motor vehicles on public roads. They think that if their wards learn to drive a vehicle, they can help in doing household chores by running errands and also drive family members to where they want to go. There are many who buy two-wheelers for their children after they pass Class X and four-wheelers after Class XII. Many parents are not aware of the traffic rule that their wards who are under 18 should not drive any motor vehicle above 50 cc.\u201d \nNot an easy task \nRoad users and activists blame police personnel for their inaction in nabbing errant underage drivers but police personnel have different accounts. \nA traffic police inspector said: \u201cNabbing the minor riding a bike is not an easy task. If we chase them, they may fall or skid. That can result in injuries, even death. Also, juveniles cannot be prosecuted like adults. So most youngsters do not understand the seriousness of the issue at all.\u201d \nGiving various suggestions, Vijay Mehta, secretary of Citizens for Safe Roads, a voluntary organisation, said, \u201cParents are providing vehicles to their school-going children and encouraging them to ride. This is very dangerous behaviour. The heads of schools or educational institutions do not bother about law or safety. Police ask the school authorities to prevent the menace. Schools are a better place to check this practice, not the roads. Their parents can be summoned and prosecuted for the offence.\u201d \nAccident compensation \nV.S. Suresh, an advocate, pointed out that it is usually a Herculean task to get compensation for road accident victims in cases of accidents involving vehicles driven by underage persons. \nOn their part, teachers say parents should also be held responsible. \nAjeeth Prasad Jain, adviser, Chennai Sahodaya Schools, said: \u201cMany students park their vehicles at least half a kilometre away from the school and walk. If they bring the vehicles to school, we certainly will take action against them. Parents must be educated first on this and police should initiate action against the owners of the vehicles.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chitra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. abhishek of vysarpadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p. raj", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ennore express highway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tiruninravur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-22T22:29:56.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ceeb1d46ecf4f99ea24adfcc1b8658c24707f8a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXpRWbKZZiPxvV9jmX_8X26mT_0PetBLV6ihsmPo.8FYiXj3qxy2LhddzN8Z.mr1hpxzAwe8NdokYEvlml0bnzqr_VzOrZvQCyDf0aW_efD5PJnNQgKlr_ERk9Q.GjgOZ8BxoQ3c3K9g--", "site_full": "www.thehindubusinessline.com", "site": "thehindubusinessline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/?service=rss#", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Line - Home", "title": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "title_full": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "published": "2018-03-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/article23325072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BL23STATESCENTRALMUMBAI", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ceeb1d46ecf4f99ea24adfcc1b8658c24707f8a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXpRWbKZZiPxvV9jmX_8X26mT_0PetBLV6ihsmPo.8FYiXj3qxy2LhddzN8Z.mr1hpxzAwe8NdokYEvlml0bnzqr_VzOrZvQCyDf0aW_efD5PJnNQgKlr_ERk9Q.GjgOZ8BxoQ3c3K9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rashmi Pratap", "published": "2018-03-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mumbai, NCR most affected by real estate slowdown", "text": "Developers offering attractive discounts to woo buyers Mumbai, March 22 \nIndia\u2019s two sought-after living destinations \u2013 NCR and Mumbai \u2013 have been the worst hit by the current real estate meltdown. While property prices in Mumbai have fallen for the first time in recent history, NCR has seen the rates plummeting by 6 per cent since 2015 amid waning investor interest and builders sitting over incomplete projects. \nBengaluru and Hyderabad have seen some appreciation, while in Chennai, the price rise has been less than 5 per cent, according to data from the real-estate consultancy, Liases Foras. \u201cNCR has been the worst affected because investor participation, as well as black money deployment, was very high. Prices were absolutely speculative as Delhi has enormous land availability. Moreover, uninhabitable locations were being sold at high prices. The bubble had to burst,\u201d Pankaj Kapoor, founder and MD, Liases Foras, told BusinessLine . \nAmit Oberoi, National Director at Colliers International, points out that investors made up for almost 50 per cent of the buyers in NCR until 2013. \u201cEven before a project was completed, it was flipped twice or thrice between investors, leading to an increase in rates. These people are no longer participating in the market. So sales are shrinking,\u201d he says. \n\n\nSanjay Sharma, Managing Director of Gurgaon-based real-estate consultancy, Qubrex, says the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has not been effectively implemented in NCR. \u201cHence, that injection of confidence has not happened. In many places, the property is ready but physical and social infrastructure around it has not developed, depressing the prices,\u201d he says. \nMumbai\u2019s woes \nHowever, Mumbai Metropolitan Region\u2019s (MMR) story has been different. The financial capital saw a rapid rise in new launches from 2009 to 2014, with slum rehabilitation projects bringing in new supply. The proposed Navi Mumbai airport fuelled a real estate boom in the twin city and, along with new development beyond the suburbs, led to a supply glut. \n\u201cIn MMR, the unsold inventory is the highest in the country (2,69,230 units or 48 months). An efficient market maintains 8 to 12 months of inventory, indicating a downward pressure on prices,\u201d said Kapoor. Put simply, MMR requires four years to sell off the existing unsold units. \nSamantak Das, chief economist and national director at Knight Frank India, says: \u201cFor the first time, we have seen a fall in quoted/asking price in Mumbai in 2017. The asking rate in Delhi fell in 2016 itself. The effective price discount through waivers in GST, stamp duty and registration is 10 to 12 per cent in Mumbai and 15 to 17 per cent in Delhi.\u201d \nHe points out that while only 10 to 15 per cent of the projects were earlier giving this discount, now about 85 per cent of the projects are doling them out to improve sales. \u201cDevelopers are trying to complete the projects for which they need to clock sales. There is price resistance in Mumbai, and this price has cracked for the first time. This will infuse a lot of demand,\u201d he says. \nEconomic condition \nSharma says the overall economy is slowing down. \u201cThere is not much money with individuals or businesses to invest. As 2019 elections are approaching, the uncertainty in the market will increase and property prices will be in a limbo,\u201d he says. \nKapoor believes that prices will not rise for the next two years. \u201cI don\u2019t see price rise across markets, as prices are still unaffordable and the pace has to grow further for the market to be sustainable,\u201d he says. \nAccording Knight Frank\u2019s affordability index, the price of a house should not be more than 4.5 times the family income. In Mumbai, it is 7.5 times, and even in Gurugram, it is more than 5 times. These indicators point to a long overdue correction in the market and it seems to be happening finally.

According to the space agency, the satellite with a life span of around 10 years will be put into orbit by the Indian rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F08). The rocket is expected to blast off from the second launch pad at the Sriharikota rocket port in Andhra Pradesh at 4.56 p.m., on March 29. The ISRO said that the GSAT-6A was similar to the GSAT-6. The satellite will provide a platform for developing technologies such as demonstration of 6m S-Band Unfurlable Antenna, handheld ground terminals and network management techniques. These are useful in satellite-based mobile communication applications.

Kolukkumalai is 7,130 ft above sea level.\nBut for a forester S.Jeyasingh who was suspended for negligence, the state government seems to have washed its hands off the incident by putting the blame on the trekkers. The state government said the trekkers didn't get permission from the forest department and took a route which was prohibited for trekking.\nSome serious grievances of the forest department such as staff shortage didn't get a due mention in government statements.\nThe Belgium national Peter Van Geit of the Chennai Trekking Club which organized the trekking for a team of 27 is yet to be questioned by the police in connection with the incident.\nHowever, the Atulya Misra commission constituted to probe the tragedy has started inquiries with officials and people.\nAtulya Misra is Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management Department.\nThe panel is supposed to complete the probe and submit a report to the government in two months.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "r.nivya prakruthi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k.sai vasumathi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government rajaji hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolukkumalai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coimbatore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madurai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurangani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theni", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T12:30:18.014+03:00"}], "totalResults": 283, "moreResultsAvailable": 273, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746417807&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AIN+location%3AChennai&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 862, "extra": {"place": "Chennai", "country": "IN", "lat": "13.0826802", "lng": "80.2707184"}}
