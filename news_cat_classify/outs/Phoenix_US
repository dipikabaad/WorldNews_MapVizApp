Inside Devin Booker's 70-Point Game, One Year Later", "text": "B/R Devin Booker was fatigued. The Phoenix Suns guard didn't express it, but then-head coach Earl Watson could read it on his face before the game. The Suns arrived in Boston on the final leg of a back-to-back, the fourth stop of a six-game road trip. They had just suffered a 28-point trouncing from the Brooklyn Nets \u2014their sixth straight loss. Nearly half of Phoenix's roster was out because of injury or \"rest.\"\nWatson, sensing Booker's exhaustion, kept his pregame message brief. \"Be legendary,\" he said. Booker was familiar with the phrase: Lakers legend Kobe Bryant wrote those two words on a pair of Kobe 11s that he signed and gifted the Phoenix prodigy the previous season. Booker looked at Watson and nodded. \"It was a tired nod, but like, I'm here to be a professional ,\" Watson recalled.\nWhat transpired next on TD Garden's parquet floor would generate a leaguewide buzz that is still felt a year later: Booker dropped 70. It was the most points scored by a NBA player since Bryant scored 81 on the Toronto Raptors in 2006. But unlike Bryant's outing, Booker's performance came in a loss. It was just the fifth time in NBA history that a player scored 70 points or more in a losing effort. Wilt Chamberlain did it three times. David Thompson, at 23, scored 73 points with the Denver Nuggets in a two-point loss to the Detroit Pistons on April 9, 1978.\nIn the year since last March 24, many have debated the performance's legacy. Booker became the youngest player in league history to reach that mark, but the game's outcome never hung in the balance. Was it a legitimate 70 points or does the performance deserve an asterisk? Was it just an exceptional offensive night or was it the arrival of a budding young star?\n\nAs those at the game tell it, Booker's 70-point effort was a moment worth celebrating. It just wasn't expected on this particular night and at this particular point in his career. Booker was in his second season and just 20 years old. His team boasted the youngest lineup in NBA\u2014according to Elias Sports Bureau, the Suns' average age was just 21 years, 14 days. Marquese Chriss was 19. Derrick Jones Jr. was 20. Tyler Ulis was 21. Alex Len, the team's center, was the starting lineup's elder statesman, at 23 years old. \"Phoenix pretty much had no other option,\" Doug Haller, who covered the game for the Arizona Republic , said. \"It was just Devin.\"\nBooker got off to a slow start. He missed his first three shots and didn't convert on his first field goal until 4:40 was left in the first quarter. The Celtics made it a priority to hinder Booker's offense from the outset. They ran a steady rotation of Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart, two of their best on-ball defenders, against Phoenix's only scoring threat, and it proved highly effective. By halftime, Boston had opened up a 23-point lead. Booker had 19 points.\nTim Kempton, the Suns' radio color analyst who also played eight years in the NBA, remembered the mood going into the half. \"You're sitting there not really expecting anything,\" he said. \"We're getting drilled by the Celtics. You're just kind of like, Uh-oh. Devin Booker is obviously our best player. He's playing well, but we're getting throttled by the Boston Celtics.\"\n\nEarl Watson Matt York/Associated Press To switch it up, Watson decided to shift Booker over from shooting to point guard\u2014a position normally occupied by Eric Bledsoe, who was sidelined with knee soreness. Phoenix ran a heavy dose of pick-and-roll action, and the Celtics' bigs\u2014Amir Johnson and Kelly Olynyk\u2014struggled to defend it. Booker's numbers soared. He scored 23 points on 5-of-9 shooting in the third, with 11 coming at the foul line. Suddenly, with a quarter left, he had 42 points.\nBut Booker had also taken a beating, physically, against Smart, an aggressive defender who can irritate the opposing team's best player. Booker showed signs of frustration. He complained to the officials that Smart was walking underneath his jumper. At one point, Booker nearly turned his ankle.\nWatson was already low on bodies, and he didn't want to see Booker get hurt, down 97-80 heading into the fourth. \"I kind of looked at [Booker] at the end of the third quarter\u2014it was a look to say, You're done for the game ,\" Watson said. \"He looked at me and shook his head no. I think Marcus Smart kind of got him going. He came out in the fourth quarter, and he just went to work.\"\nBooker took 16 of the team's 27 shots in the final period, and as his numbers climbed, the mood in the arena appeared to shift. \"I remember as he's getting close to 50, I turned and looked at [Kempton] like, Where is this going? \" Haller recalled.\nGary Washburn, a longtime NBA writer for the Boston Globe , was shocked when he looked at the box score during the fourth. \"I saw [Michael] Jordan score 49 on the Clippers way back in the day, and he was just a one-man team,\" he said. \"This was a little different. It was kind like it snuck up on you. All of a sudden he had 55, and you're like, Whoa! Wait a minute. \"\n\nDevin Booker Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press The night took a historic turn with 1:48 left, when a Booker putback gave him 61 points\u2014a new franchise record. (Tom Chambers had set the previous mark of 60 against the Seattle SuperSonics in 1990.) The Boston crowd, normally hostile to opposing players, cheered Booker on. The entire Suns bench was on its feet.\nBut Watson was unaware of the individual performance taking place. During a pair of Booker free throws, Watson turned to his assistant, Nate Bjorkgren, and asked, \"What are they cheering for?\"\n\"Book has 65,\" Bjorkgren responded.\n\"No shit?!\"\n\"Yes, coach.\"\n\"Oh shit. Stay in the game,\" Watson said. In the contest's final 45 seconds, the Suns began intentionally fouling and calling timeouts to stop the clock. Then Watson, during the stoppages, would draw up plays for Booker.\nThe Celtics weren't pleased. Players and coaching staff shouted their disapproval from the bench. The game was already decided, so what was Watson doing?\nHe insisted he was just trying to \"keep chipping the score\"\u2014a lesson he learned from Hubie Brown, whom he considers a mentor. \"If you lose with a young team, you really want those losses to be less than seven,\" Watson said. \"So at the end of the year, you get on the board and you give them a chance to believe.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "devin booker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "earl wa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kobe bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "booker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "phoenix suns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "suns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto raptors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "td garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:05:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "640624b536d26e47334d718467e4511150592d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4onWBjpgEIiygOGVM0gBWMTp3qtvTs.TWjbLdAUVlU4TNkKWdiuDGmeUaLtf5YLcL_h8hC.aaGMmmKImQIa0rZQ--", "site_full": "news.abs-cbn.com", "site": "abs-cbn.com", "site_section": "http://abs-cbnnews.com//sports/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports", "title": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "title_full": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "published": "2018-03-24T06:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/news/03/24/lebron.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 323, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1330, "comments": 0, "shares": 1330}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "640624b536d26e47334d718467e4511150592d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWQVrhJhMuK3wMTuGG0kfz4onWBjpgEIiygOGVM0gBWMTp3qtvTs.TWjbLdAUVlU4TNkKWdiuDGmeUaLtf5YLcL_h8hC.aaGMmmKImQIa0rZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2018-03-24T06:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "NBA: James scores 27 points as Cavs rout Suns", "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) drives to the basket against Phoenix Suns guard Josh Jackson (20) during the first half at Quicken Loans Arena.

Terrified passengers say that driver was falling asleep and it led to a confrontation caught on video, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports .\nThree of the passengers who were on the bus arrived in Dallas seven hours late from Phoenix.\nSome said they weren't so sure they'd make it in one piece after they caught the driver pinching her cheeks with tweezers just to stay awake. At this point in the bus trip from Phoenix to Dallas, passengers had had enough.\n\"We politely asked her four times to pull over,\" said Jasmine McLellan, who said she was among as many as 60 people who were on board a Greyhound bus who noticed their driver falling asleep behind the wheel.\n\"I got to the point where we saw her going like this and just dozing off,\" said McLellan.\n\"The bus was leaning little and that's when people started to really worry,\" said passenger Philip Hurd. \"She was using techniques to try and stay awake and I think that was the initial concern ... We would go over the white line and everybody would be like wake up and she had tweezers she was poking herself with tweezers to keep herself awake it was awful. It got to the point where we had to raise our voice pull over we have children on this bus pull over.\"\nA confrontation happened while passengers said the bus was still moving and the driver stood up to argue with them.\nPassengers said they got a Border Patrol escort to a safe location where Greyhound replaced the driver.\nThe incident raises serious questions about whether a nationwide shortage of bus drivers is pushing current ones to drive without proper rest.\nDallas-based Greyhound responded with a statement from Senior Communications Specialist Lanesha Gipson:\nOur schedules are now running on time and we're back on schedule. However, we were experiencing delays at the Dallas station earlier today as we waited for drivers to become available once they completed their federally mandated rest. With resources as tight as they have been, any delay that occurs elsewhere can create a domino effect, which can have an impact on a driver's hours of service. We work diligently to accommodate our customers with the limited resources we have available, and we've been actively hiring drivers in order to meet the increasing demand for our service so these types of delays are minimized. All delayed customers have departed the station are now en route to their destinations. \nRegarding the specific incident on the bus headed to Dallas, Gipson issued this statement:\nWe are currently looking into these allegations, as we take the issue of driver fatigue very seriously. Because safety is the cornerstone of our business, we take necessary precautions to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving and we make it easy for drivers to be reassigned if they do feel fatigued or don't feel confident that they can operate the bus safely for any reason. Our drivers are in regular contact with our dispatch office, and if they state they are feeling tired or fatigued, they are immediately removed from the schedule for at least 12 hours to allow them to get some rest. Once they feel alert and able to return to work, they may do so. \nSome of these passengers said they paid more than $200 for their tickets and would like a refund.\nGreyhound has promised a refund after this potentially dangerous incident, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mclellan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasmine mclellan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hurd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs dallas/fort worth", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T04:38:59.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9676306ae2b932140eeaf62a970e7510abff3c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWgm7cbfsR3u08zxrIMGhlRWTiRomhO1wfyHhNPa1X0Jo42dlM02a_81vxBwsc6YHltWm.a7sF_3S9AudUTdE3107PP5CXtstkPbqh6QDtBv8045N_ugO_3o7YDJTvR8U998H1Ge62c6dgGq2MT9fBd3jGLXjF5xc7OStl3U8Q1lULj1fn5235UwiGGeYsEiJ2Bagc3i2oqMx4zQHnnXSZGS639g6Vh3Y-", "site_full": "www.azcentral.com", "site": "azcentral.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Maricopa County sees biggest population growth in nation", "title_full": "Maricopa County sees biggest population growth in nation", "published": "2018-03-22T17:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5579e6eb809d393a7188693da585cbff7e89464c/c=0-125-3000-1820&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/03/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/636573215004248732-PNIBrd2-07-13-2017-Republic-1-A003--2017-07-12-IMG-PNI-Monsoon-1-1-1EJ02H83-L1062937293-IMG-PNI-Monsoon-1-1-1EJ02H83.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 3741, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3567, "comments": 1, "shares": 3567}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9676306ae2b932140eeaf62a970e7510abff3c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWgm7cbfsR3u08zxrIMGhlRWTiRomhO1wfyHhNPa1X0Jo42dlM02a_81vxBwsc6YHltWm.a7sF_3S9AudUTdE3107PP5CXtstkPbqh6QDtBv8045N_ugO_3o7YDJTvR8U998H1Ge62c6dgGq2MT9fBd3jGLXjF5xc7OStl3U8Q1lULj1fn5235UwiGGeYsEiJ2Bagc3i2oqMx4zQHnnXSZGS639g6Vh3Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jessica Boehm", "published": "2018-03-22T17:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Maricopa County sees biggest population growth in nation", "text": "More people moved to Maricopa County than any other county in the country last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates released Thursday.\nMaricopa County's population jumped by nearly 74,000 people \u2014 a 1.7 percent increase.

There were no arrests, they reported. \nMore: At 1 million plus strong, March for Our Lives rallies crush expectations \nLikewise, in Salt Lake City, about 8,000 protesters collided with 1,000 pro-gun counter-demonstrators, exchanged shouts but remaining peaceful, according to police. \nUtah, a state that also allows open-carry, hosted some in the pro-gun rally carrying pistols on their hips and AR-style weapons slung over their shoulders, \"because I can. It's our right,\" Mark Stewart, a counter protester told the Salt Lake Tribune . \nIn Helena, Mont., a March for Our Guns counter event drew about 150 people. Attendees held signs that said \"No guns, No freedom\" and \"Montana treasures God, guns and family.\" \nMike Opie, 32, of Helena, said he felt sorry for the Florida victims, most of whom were high school students. \n\u201cI\u2019m upset kids got shot,\u201d said Opie, who said he served with in the Marines in Iraq. \u201cBut to take guns away is not constitutional.\u201d About 150 attend March for our Guns rally in Helena. #mtnews pic.twitter.com/aYO0zEJFwv \u2014 Phil Drake (@GFTrib_PDrake) March 24, 2018 \nIn Los Angeles, there were only about a dozen counter protesters.

They are behind police tape as the main march starts to approach. pic.twitter.com/fOjUo4H9Nx \nHours after an anti-gun violence rally in Lansing, Mich., a pro-Second Amendment group hosted speakers on the Michigan Capitol's steps. \n\"If we do not assert our rights, we will lose them,\" said state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, a Republican candidate for governor, \n\"Where was all this when we were having all these shootings years ago?\" asked Hope Coleman, 40, who said she is affiliated with the Patriot movement for President Trump in Phoenix. \"Why should everyone get punished because of someone else's negligence?\" \nIn Phoenix, marcher Sharon Bedney, 77, of Mesa engaged with some of the protesters. \n\"If you can't shoot, you can't teach?\" she asked in response to a protester. \"Teachers are there to teach. They don't need the added pressure.\" \nWilliam Cairnes, 63, of Phoenix, a U.S. Navy veteran, argued with some of the protesters carrying guns. \n\"We want rational control, that's what we want,\" he said. \"This is happening far too often. If we can control their means for mass shootings, shouldn't we at least look into it?\" \nCasey Goble, 19, was among the counterprotesters at the march. He said he was carrying an unloaded AR-15 to make a statement and to exercise his right to do so. \nHe said he supports some measures of gun reform, such as stricter background checks to keep criminals and those with mental-health issues from accessing guns. But he said he came because he supports the Second Amendment. \n\"I support their (protesters') right to have a gun even if they don't like it,\" he said, saying he brought his unloaded AR-15 \"just in case.\" \nJamila Rahim, 20, an Arizona State University sophomore, came to the march with friends. \n\"I get that this is our Second Amendment,\" she said. \"We're not trying to revoke it or take anything away. We just want common-sense gun laws.\" \nShe said she was surprised to find so many like-minded people at the march. \n\"Being here is reassuring,\" she said, adding that if gun reform doesn't happen, \"we'll be back.\" \nBut Rahim said there was a disconnect between those like-minded marchers and the handful of counterprotesters. She feared people may have missed an opportunity to have one-on-one conversations to further discussions on such a controversial issue. \nPeople may be reluctant to have those conversations because they're \"scared of what they're going to hear,\" she said. \n\"Coming out here, we're kind of preaching to the choir anyways,\" Rahim said. \"But going up to them, talking with them, that's where the real change begins.\" \nVan Gutier, 29, said he was there \"standing up for the Bill of Rights.\" \n\"You're playing the blame game,\" he said to a marcher. \"I don't want the government coming up with definitions of who is mentally ill. The government overreaches. The government cares about power. It will try to retain that power by disarming its citizens.\" \nHe said banning guns won't stop mass shootings. \n\u201cWe need to take ownership over ourselves,\" he said. \nKen and Linda Bielek, both 76, were among the marchers. They said they were fed up with a lack of progress on the issue of gun control. They said they don't want to \"take away anybody's guns,\" but do want to see universal background checks and assault-rifle bans. \n\"I don't know of anybody that's saying take away guns from people who have shotguns, a revolver or pistol for home protection or target shooting,\" Ken Bielek said. \"We're not asking the politicians, we're demanding that they ban assault weapons. There's gun violence happening every day. We're fed up with it.\" \nAt one point, Ken Bielek pulled out his pocket Constitution. As a U.S. Army veteran, he said he supports the Second Amendment. But he said the founders couldn't have predicted the rapid change in gun technology. \n\"They had muskets back then,\" he said. \"Today, they're killing machines.\" \nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY, Matt Mencarini, Lansing (Mich.)

Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents. Early on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed. A larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document. Around October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Around the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety. Waymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location. But Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers. Mr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven. When Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role. Uber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions. Waymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode. Not all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Uber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \u201clonger-term financial viability.\u201d Already, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber\u2019s plans for autonomous vehicles. \u201cThe collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cEvery other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven. For Uber, it\u2019s going to be hard to shake.\u201d \nFollow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka \nMike Isaac and Cade Metz contributed reporting.

Shame on you!\u201d \n  The marchers passed several Mormon Church buildings, with the man in orange still heckling her, and then climbed a hill to the Capitol, where they ascended a series of white steps. A man in camouflage turned his attention to a woman on the steps who appeared to be part of a gun control group. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he shouted at her. \u201cAre you even from this country?\u201d The counterprotest in Salt Lake City was organized by Bryan Melchior, co-owner of the Utah Gun Exchange, a website that sells firearms. Mr. Melchior said he recently had met many young people who felt that the growing call for stricter gun laws did not represent their views. Among them was Cody Frandsen, 17, a high school senior wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap. \u201cI feel like an outsider,\u201d said Mr. Frandsen, standing with friends who nodded in agreement. \u201cA lot of the millennials, our age group, is left-leaning.\u201d The group began talking about gun laws it might be able to support. \u201cI\u2019m totally for a background check,\u201d said Mr. Frandsen, noting that he supported universal checks. \u201cI think there should be a mental health check\u201d before purchasing a gun, said his friend Logan Coffey, 17. \u201cAnd the government should know where every single firearm is.\u201d Of those who marched in Washington in support of gun control, Mr. Frandsen said he did not agree with anything \u201cthey have to say,\u201d adding, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we could come up with some kind of compromise.\u201d \nKatharine Seelye and Jeffery C.
