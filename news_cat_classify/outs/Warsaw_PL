A suitable app and a configured central system are needed for the service. The next step is to use specific voice commands that the software responds to. \u201cA voice receiver like Amazon Echo or a smartphone receives words spoken by us. Then it directs the command to a special central control unit. The control panel, on the other hand, transmits the command further until the final impulse reaches the mounted drive, which, for example, opens the door or closes the blinds on the window. Therefore, our voice triggers an action the final effect of which will be the physical movement of the home fixture. Of course, these stages take place in a flash,\u201d explains Grzegorz Bu\u0142at, the head of technological processes at Oknoplast.

A suitable app and a configured central system are needed for the service. The next step is to use specific voice commands that the software responds to. \u201cA voice receiver like Amazon Echo or a smartphone receives words spoken by us. Then it directs the command to a special central control unit. The control panel, on the other hand, transmits the command further until the final impulse reaches the mounted drive, which, for example, opens the door or closes the blinds on the window. Therefore, our voice triggers an action the final effect of which will be the physical movement of the home fixture. Of course, these stages take place in a flash,\u201d explains Grzegorz Bu\u0142at, the head of technological processes at Oknoplast.

Jacek Czaputowicz. Picture: Polish Radio \nJacek Czaputowicz was speaking after the country\u2019s ruling conservatives on Thursday signalled they would accommodate some of the EU executive\u2019s recommendations over sweeping changes to the court system in Poland. \nCzaputowicz told public Polish Radio 1 on Friday that a new piece of legislation drafted by MPs from Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party was designed to modify contested laws reforming the judiciary in a way that would \u201crespond to the European Commission\u2019s expectations.\u201d \nHe also said that Poland was seeking a compromise with the European Commission over sweeping judicial reforms. \n\u201cWe are working for the Commission to withdraw its proposal [over Article 7] and we would not want it to be put to a vote,\u201d he said. \nIn a similar statement, Czaputowicz told public broadcaster TVP on Thursday evening that he would like to see an end to Warsaw\u2019s dispute with Brussels over judicial changes and that Poland was doing everything to make that happen. \nThe European Commission in December took the unprecedented step of triggering Article 7 of the EU Treaty against Poland , stepping up pressure on Warsaw over the controversial changes to Poland\u2019s justice system. \n\"We need to meet [the Commission\u2019s] expectations halfway,\u201d Czaputowicz told TVP. \nHe also said that the authorities in Warsaw were working to bring about a halt to the Commission\u2019s Article 7 proceedings against Poland. \nEarlier on Thursday, Poland\u2019s ruling conservative Law and Justice party came forward with a legislative initiative to modify disputed laws regulating the work of the country's common court system and the Supreme Court. \nUnder the draft, the justice minister would no longer be able to dismiss court presidents and deputy presidents without consulting judges and the powerful National Council of the Judiciary, PiS MP Marek Ast told reporters. \nIn a further modification of existing regulations which politicians said was intended to accommodate the European Commission\u2019s recommendations, the retirement age of male and female judges would be set at an equal level of 65 years of age. \nAnd in what appeared to be another step designed to help reach an agreement with Brussels, the country\u2019s ruling conservatives said they were ready to publish three Constitutional Tribunal judgments that the ruling party argues the top court issued in violation of the law in 2016. \n(gs/pk)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zagranicy grzegorz s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacek czaputowicz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czaputowicz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polish radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warsaw", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T15:54:35.035+03:00"}], "totalResults": 23, "moreResultsAvailable": 13, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521745961199&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3APL+location%3AWarsaw&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 906, "extra": {"place": "Warsaw", "country": "PL", "lat": "52.2296756", "lng": "21.0122287"}}
