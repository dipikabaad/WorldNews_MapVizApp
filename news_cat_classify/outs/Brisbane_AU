But the pool is filled with dirt and scattered with weeds.\nBorn and raised in the Western Downs, Mr Brown is a full-time bus driver. Today, he\u2019s showing a group of farmers around his hometown, Miles, 330km northwest of Brisbane.\nUnlike Mr Brown, these farmers are not from Queensland. They live on properties in New South Wales and South Australia that may soon be impacted by coal seam or shale gas infrastructure. Many are on the high pressure pipeline route from Santos\u2019 controversial proposed Narrabri Gas Project.\nAwaiting the approval of such projects, the farmers are embarking on a four-day tour of southwest Queensland for a first-hand look at its gas infrastructure and the social consequences of boom-bust mining economies.\nmedia_camera Unfortunately for Miles, abandoned houses (and pools) are now common. Picture: Gemma Clarke\nThough it\u2019s not a mining town, Miles was part of southwest Queensland\u2019s coal seam gas construction boom. The explosion in exploration and mining activity in its surrounding areas saw a huge influx in workforce demand and fly-in-fly-out workers from around 2010.\n\u201cGISERA (The CSIRO\u2019s Gas Industry Social & Environmental Research Alliance) put out these fantastic figures,\u201d said David Sweetapple. He\u2019s a real estate agent and land developer in Miles, and has lived in the region for 60 years.\n\u201cThey said they would need accommodation and infrastructure built, and feeding and entertaining. They said we will live locally and buy locally. So the town went wild. The banks lent us all money \u2014 the council spent $30 million in Miles alone on water sewerage and waste management,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said, referring to the time around 2008 when the initial presentation from APLNG (Australia Pacific LNG, Origin Energy\u2019s joint venture with ConocoPhillips and Sinopec) was made.\nExisting homeowners with a patch of backyard to spare subdivided their blocks into two, and towers of flats began to loom over old Queenslanders. Developers and investors flooded in from all over Australia, and there was a surge in new housing with 1500 new homes approved.\nmedia_camera Even new homes have little chance of being sold, at least for nowhere near what they were purchased for. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cIt was like being caught in a gold rush,\u201d said local Rachel Kerwick. She\u2019s president of the Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce, a role she has shared since its inception in 2005 with fellow community member John Hoffman.\n\u201cThere were investors from Melbourne and Sydney, well-educated people who did their homework and believed the literature the government and the CSIRO all put out,\u201d Ms Kerwick said.\nThat literature included an environmental impact statement, a future directions statement, and a social impact management plan, a detailed document that outlines how APLNG would mitigate the social impacts that arise from their work in the Western Downs region.\nMiles\u2019s population was projected to increase to 5000 people, and a growth in the workforce was predicted to continue until 2034.\n\u201cThey were talking about the town of Miles and Chinchilla actually merging,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple.\nFor locals leasing housing, the immediate effect of the boom was a rent increase.\nMr Brown set a scene as the bus winds through a half-finished estate behind the racecourse.\n\u201cImagine you\u2019ve got a son who finishes school and wants to stay around. He gets a job at the local council, where he can make a weekly salary of $700, and he doesn\u2019t bother buying, because he can rent for $300 a week. His wife works at the tuckshop; the kids are in the swimming club. Then the miners move in, and the agent knocks on his door and says, \u2018Sorry mate, but we can get $800 for this place now.\u2019 So your son and his family leave town.\u201d\nAccording to Mr Sweetapple, one look at property and housing prices during the boom will show that Mr Brown\u2019s scenario is not hard to picture.\n\u201cYou\u2019d buy a block for $200,000,\u201d Mr Sweetapple explained, \u201cand spend $450,000 on a really nice house; put in Colorbond fencing and paving. The rent at the time was $800 to $1000 a week.\u201d\nAt the peak of the boom, even a space at one of the local caravan parks crept up to nearly $1000 per week. Long-term residents who could no longer afford the rent moved out.\nBut when the construction phase of all major coal seam gas projects progressed to the export phase, many mining contractors and employees were laid off. And once the Condabri workers camp that many of them were living in was emptied, the overflow of those renting in Miles were shifted to fill the camp\u2019s 400 beds.\nmedia_camera Not only have houses been abandoned, but businesses as well. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cOrigin walked into our real estate office one day at the end of 2013 and said, \u2018We\u2019re cancelling every lease of the houses we have. If anyone wants a job, they have to live in the camp,\u2019\u201d said Mr Sweetapple. \u201cVirtually overnight, in December 2013, the town just drained out of people and they never came back.\u201d\nAs per APLNG\u2019s social impact management plan, construction workers are often accommodated in temporary facilities like Condabri to help ensure that community demographics in regional towns are not negatively impacted from an influx of new residents. But given that more than 100 workers were initially housed in Miles to begin with, their absence was felt immediately.\n\u201cWe had hundreds living in a camp less than 25km from our town for years,\u201d Ms Kerwick said, \u201cand they never even came in. They might have driven through the community on their way to work, and occasionally, if we were doing a community event like the races, they\u2019d send a busload of people in, but that was it.\u201d\nMr Sweetapple too is frustrated about the mining companies\u2019 failure to engage with the town in the way they promised in the APLNG documents published in 2010 and 2011.\n\u201cHaving told us they were going to live local and buy local, they then said, \u2018Local for us is camps out of town. We\u2019re living in the area.\u2019 As for buy local, they said, \u2018We\u2019re a multinational company. We\u2019re APLNG and local for us is Australia and New Zealand, not Miles and Chinchilla.\u201d\nFor its part, an Origin spokesman told news.com.au: \u201cOrigin, as Upstream Operator of Australia Pacific LNG, is proud to have committed tens of millions of dollars to support local communities such as Miles, and remains committed to the region by continuing to provide incentives for our staff to live locally and by sourcing local goods and services through our \u2018Regional Buy\u2019 program.\u201d\nHe added Origin has spent millions of dollars to benefit the local community, including investing $2,000,000 into a community skills scholarship, providing up to $13,500 to apprentices within the gas fields region to help them complete their apprenticeships locally. Since 2007, more than 150 scholarships have been awarded. Origin has also invested in housing, plus water and sewage upgrades in the region, and upgraded the local airport to the tune of $20 million among other projects.\nAccording to Mr Brown, the only people who will benefit from a boom are publicans, local councillors, real estate agents and investors.\n\u201cThe local drapery store won\u2019t, [the mining workers] won\u2019t buy shirts from there. They\u2019re nomadic. They move around all the time and follow the work. And if someone does bring his family, do you think his wife is going to work in the school tuckshop?\u201d\nAfter the last of the mining workers were shifted out to Condabri, the vacancy rate in Miles rose to 45 per cent, where it stayed at for several years.\n\u201cRents were down to $150 a week for those fortunate to have it,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said. \u201cThat was furnished apartments, furnished houses.\u201d\nAccording to Ms Kerwick, some people just walked out, and those who stayed all suffered financially.\nmedia_camera Farmers from NSW and SA inspecting the coal seam projects near Miles. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cWe\u2019re left with people whose businesses went bankrupt and who lost their homes because they took the punt and invested in building another one. Mortgages and repossessions are happening at least once a week,\u201d she said.\nThe incomplete estate behind the racecourse Mr Brown drives through is owned by Mr Sweetapple. It still has four stages of completion to go, but construction has halted.\n\u201cIn my estate, there have been three of four mortgage and repossession sales, and they\u2019ve sold for $20,000 to $22,000 a block,\u201d the real estate agent said.\nToday, Miles\u2019 population stands at just 1800, a number that now has to front the cost for the $30 million worth of infrastructure they no longer actually need. Mr Sweetapple said the rates on the properties he owns in town have doubled in the last four years.\n\u201cWe have even less people than we did before [the boom],\u201d said Ms Kerwick. \u201cThe Miles community itself was almost decimated. Brand new homes that cost the investor $700,000 to build are being sold for $200,000.\u201d\nMr Brown tells a story about his neighbour, a woman from interstate who bought the house next door to his for $400,000.\n\u201cShe subdivided the block and developed it, then just sold them both: one for $200,000 and the other for $160,000,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Mr Sweetapple, the aftermath of the mining boom completely killed the market.\n\u201cThe rents plummeted, the property values plummeted and they kept the camp full. That\u2019s when I read very carefully through all the Origin lease documents and the approvals granted by the Coordinator-General,\u201d he said.\nIn 2016, Mr Sweetapple discovered a condition in Origin\u2019s 2010 Environmental Impact Statement that said under no circumstances can a temporary workers accommodation facility exist beyond five years.\nmedia_camera The town has been left with plenty of vacant lots when businesses left town. Picture: Gemma Clarke\n\u201cThey were in breach already. [The Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce] got more and more politically active, and we met with [Origin\u2019s] CEO eight times. He basically said that if you make it difficult for us, we\u2019ll make it doubly difficult for you.\u201d\nThen in May 2017, after months of negotiations, the multinational corporation announced that it would close its Condabri workers camp for good later that year. Origin\u2019s remaining operations staff would have to move into local accommodation arrangements in Miles, as well as in neighbouring towns such as Chinchilla.\n\u201cHad we not as a community fought that very hard, they\u2019d still be in that camp,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple.\nIn August last year, the Queensland government legislated against workforces on large resource projects within 125km of regional communities being 100 per cent fly-in-fly-out workers.\nAccording to the government\u2019s social impact statement, the Strong and Sustainable Resource Communities Act was introduced to \u201censure that residents of communities in the vicinity of large resource projects benefit from their construction and operation\u201d.\n\u201cStraight away you could see the difference,\u201d said Ms Kerwick. \u201cThey can still build a camp, but it has to be within the town. In Chinchilla, the camp is in the fringes of the community, so the people can go to the town gym, use the town pool, go to the pub a couple of nights a week if they don\u2019t want to have tea at the camp.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive positive,\u201d said Mr Sweetapple, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t come without its own problems.\u201d\nWhile in the camp, a worker\u2019s living expenses are completely covered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re flown in and out, you\u2019re given whatever you want to eat or drink. Your electricity, your cleaning, your internet is all covered. You want for nothing.\u201d\nBut now that workers in the Miles region are no longer allowed to reside in a camp away from town, living away from home allowances have been slashed.\n\u201cBy the time [the workers] pay tax, they end up with $153 extra a week. That\u2019s got to provide [everything]. They come into our office and say, \u2018How the hell am I going to survive on this money?\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s already hard \u2014 they\u2019re away from their families trying to make a living, and suddenly they\u2019ve got to come up with this extra money to compensate for what they had in the camp.\u201d\nWhen Mr Brown is asked who is left in Miles, and what he thinks of the town\u2019s future, he is largely optimistic, though complains about the lack of social services in place to support many of the low-income earners who have moved in to take advantage of the cheap rent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good vibe mostly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are just too many empty houses. Who is going to live in them? There\u2019s no work.\u201d\nmedia_camera The town is more than half an hour drive from Chinchilla, and with little work in town, many locals have abandoned Miles.\nBut Mr Sweetapple said new projects are on the horizon.\n\u201cMiles is in the Goldilocks zone \u2014 we\u2019re very close to the power grid and we get the most sunlight. All those substations are in place to receive some of the renewable energy that\u2019s being produced by the solar farms,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got massive upgrades to the power infrastructure to receive all this solar energy. The rail line has to be built from Miles to Banana, Nathan Dam has to be constructed and a big pipeline is needed to droughtproof the town.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a bit of optimism around again \u2014 not enough for spectators, but enough.\u201d\nAs for the gas industry?\n\u201cOrigin has offered [its workers] a very generous incentive,\u201d Mr Sweetapple said. \u201cThe average guy will get about $35,000 extra a year if he buys locally. But no one is doing it because they don\u2019t know week to week if they\u2019ll have a job. There\u2019s been a big restructuring \u2014 Origin is trying to wind back its costs, so they\u2019ve laid off hundreds of staff. The last thing any workers want to do then is buy a house in Miles and get caught with it.\n\u201cUnless [the workers] are forced to pay for their flights in and out or the government intervenes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any change. [The coal seam gas industry] has been a complete and utter disaster for the town.\u201d\nMr Sweetapple said he recently received a survey from a company contracted by Santos to assess its community impacts. In 2007, Santos created the GLNG project, which converts natural gas from the Surat and Bowen Basins into LNG for export to Asia.\n\u201cIt said, \u2018Santos has donated $630,000 to the region. Do you agree, disagree or strongly disagree?\u2019 If they\u2019d said, \u2018Santos has spent $630,000 \u2014 can you see where it\u2019s gone?\u2019 or, \u2018What impact has this company had on your community?\u2019 it would have been good, but there was nothing like that.\u201d\nmedia_camera Tony van Lubeck and Tony Smith inspecting a property outside Miles while researching what can happen to a former boom town.\nInstead, Mr Sweetapple made his own survey, and circulated it among 100 people in Miles. Using a company statement that discussed the mitigation of impact on communities, he apportioned the exact wording of the text with a line down the middle.\n\u201cI asked \u20181 out 10, how well did this company do in Miles?\u2019 The highest score they got was a 4. I sent that to the Coordinator-General. He said, \u2018Oh no, that\u2019s not an official survey.\u2019\u201d\nAccording to the APLNG\u2019s community investment action plan, the multinational corporation is dedicated to funding social infrastructure, as well as sponsoring and donating to local organisations\u2019 projects or events. They also aim to foster dialogue with communities, which is a commitment Mr Sweetapple said Origin\u2019s regional manager, Tim Ogilvie, has fulfilled.\n\u201cTim has been very understanding of [Miles\u2019] cause \u2026 he attends Chamber meetings and has met with us regularly. It\u2019s directives from senior executives that have caused so much financial and emotional hardship.\u201d\nMs Kerwick said big players like Origin have failed to adequately assist the community.\n\u201cThey splashed their money and gave some clubs laptops, but they never built any sustainable projects,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly now that [The Miles & Districts Chamber of Commerce] has fought for money we can do a few legacy projects, but the whole thing was handled very poorly.\u201d\n\u201cYou can see why the community feels like it does,\u201d said David. \u201cThe gas companies have damaged the very fabric of our town. We were all encouraged to gear up to provide for 40 years of partnership with the resource companies. But they only use tier-1 and tier-2 contractors \u2014 they don\u2019t use the locals.\u201d\nAs the bus tour winds down, Mr Brown returns his passenger to the local museum so they can continue on to Roma. The mood in the car is sombre.\n\u201cThe gas industry\u2019s claims are pretty false that there\u2019s not much impact,\u201d said Tony Smith of Broadwater in Warren, NSW. \u201cIt\u2019s as much social as it is environmental. If you look at the town of Tara, it didn\u2019t seem to gain. The destruction of Miles is terrible.

Referee Ashley Klein penalised Tigers forward Robbie Rochow for not standing square at marker in the sixth minute of golden point. Broncos winger Jamayne Isaako kicked the penalty goal to hand his side a 9-7 victory. The decision stunned Tigers coach Ivan Cleary and shattered his side\u2019s hopes of an unbeaten start to the season. Play Video Having reviewed the decision, referees\u2019 boss Bernard Sutton declared his officials got it wrong. \"Ultimately, the penalty was incorrect,\" Sutton told Fairfax Media. \"There are a couple of contributing factors to how the referees came to that decision. Advertisement \"Initially, Robbie Rochow doesn\u2019t start square, but he does adjust as the play-the-ball happens. \"The other thing is when [Joe] Ofahengaue plays the ball, after playing it he steps towards the left. It gives the illusion to the referees that [Robbie] Rochow is standing standing beside, but he actually does adjust to the point where the ball is to be played. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s incorrect.\u201d Sutton contacted Cleary on Saturday morning to inform the club of the NRL\u2019s verdict on the call. \u201cIvan and I have a reasonable relationship, we talk on a regular basis. We will continue to chat,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cEveryone (Klein and assistant referee Matt Noyen) matched up their information in arriving to that decision. There is no one person responsible.\u201d Asked if either whistleblower was facing the axe given it was a match-deciding blunder, Sutton said: \u201cCertainly we are not considering that at this point. We have another five games to go from the weekend. The big thing for us is to get through the weekend and then sit down on Monday and assess how we have come through each of the eight games. \"Then we can set some direction going forward. We won\u2019t make any consideration on that until we get to the end of the weekend.\" The other man at the centre of the storm, Robbie Rochow, conceded he wasn\u2019t sure if he had transgressed. \"I played every minute of that game and you just don't know,\" Rochow said after the game. \"You're out on your feet - especially during golden point - and I just did my best to get to the kicker. Whether I left early or wasn't square I'm not sure. I didn't know if someone was offside and it's just the decision on the day, isn't it? An exciting finish ended up a fizzer after a penalty, now deemed incorrect, was given. Photo: Dean Lewins \"Once the decision is made - whether it's right or wrong - you can't change the decision. The game was over. Whether he justifies it or not it doesn't matter. \"Just winning off a penalty in golden point is not a thrilling way to win I guess. \"A game like that, the way we played and the way it went at the end I would have been happy with a draw. [Golden point] has obviously got a place in our game, but whether it's during our week to week rounds is up to the game to decide.\" The Broncos were the beneficiaries of another close call when Isaako may have put his foot on the sideline. Sutton said, on the evidence available, he was satisfied with the decision for the touch judge not to put up his flag. There has been a spate of penalties in the opening rounds as officials crack down on the play-the-ball and the 10 metres. The stoppages have upset fans and commentators who feel free-flowing footy has been stifled. However, Sutton remained unapologetic. Loading \"The work they have done on the 10 metres has been really good and what the competition committee has asked us to do,\" Sutton said. \"We\u2019re actually enforcing the rules and have had the same approach to the play-the-balls. What he have seen over three weeks is that the play-the-balls have improved. They are the standards we need to maintain and keep the referees making decisions and refereeing with confidence.\" Sutton said he was still reviewing the Panthers-Bulldogs game and that a verdict hadn\u2019t been reached on whether Moses Mbye\u2019s opening try was the result of an obstruction. Frustrated Panthers coach Anthony Griffin said players would be left with no choice but to take dives to ensure the call went their way.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adrian proszenko larg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashley klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie rochow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamayne isaako", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean lewins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan cleary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nrl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fairfax media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wests tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-24T04:37:25.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03ccf29dfc8f78cfaed3c8fb40985afd1046013c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_RtBZbHhoY6cSXS7GBfwPeGDWVwOWJ7_ROFKdTy14MxvZ0vQXnzwRbZXW9NLLjkKQuDTEuEmi_Rv", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au/homepage/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "ABC Homepage", "title": "Insect numbers in decline", "title_full": "Insect numbers in decline", "published": "2018-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/7979722-16x9-large.jpg?v=2", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1031, "comments": 0, "shares": 1031}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03ccf29dfc8f78cfaed3c8fb40985afd1046013c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_RtBZbHhoY6cSXS7GBfwPeGDWVwOWJ7_ROFKdTy14MxvZ0vQXnzwRbZXW9NLLjkKQuDTEuEmi_Rv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Insect numbers in decline", "text": "Try to Download directly (18.10 MB) Play Press play then disable your screen reader.

It\u2019s a savvy legal move that will compel the AFL to completely rethink its approach to sanctioning women.\n\nAFLW grand final 2018: Lions out to capitalise on Brennan absence Read more \nBrennan\u2019s two-game ban raised immediate allegations of sex-based discrimination . The reason was simple: were Brennan were a man, she would have been asked to pay a fine, instead of being suspended. The sole reason women do not get the option of paying a fine is wage disparity (the average wage for a men\u2019s AFL player is $371,000, whereas AFLW rookies receive just $10,500). Rather than opting to have the women pay smaller fines on a pro rata basis, the AFL went with a different system that results in them being sanctioned more severely.\nThere has been an explosion of public interest in the case this week. There have also been many misconceptions about the relationship between elite sporting competitions and the law. Although sporting competitions are entitled to develop their own rules, those rules must comply with overarching legal obligations. In Australia this includes the Federal Sex Discrimination Act, which prevents discrimination against people on the basis of their sex, except in very specific circumstances.\nBrennan twice appealed the suspension. Surprisingly, her legal team didn\u2019t pursue this line of argument at the first hearing. At the second hearing , she did, represented by a team of lawyers including Jack Rush QC and Bulldogs president, Peter Gordon. The AFL argued that Brennan\u2019s legal team should have raised those arguments the first time around, were barred from raising entirely new arguments the second time around, and were simply trying to have a second bite at the cherry. Disappointingly, the appeals board deliberated for just 15 minutes, gave no reasons for its decision, and dismissed the appeal. The failure to provide an explanation for its decision raised even more legal questions, including the possibility that this was itself a denial of a fundamental legal principle \u2013 that of procedural fairness. \nKatie Brennan falls victim to gender pay gap with AFLW grand final ban | Kate O'Halloran Read more \nAll eyes were on the Bulldogs\u2019 next move. Gordon is a renowned litigator who rarely shies away from a fight and as social media exploded with speculation, a #FreeKatieBrennan movement was launched, including a petition . There was growing recognition that Brennan was a victim of circumstance, and an imperfect system which yielded a result only made possible because there are different \u2013 and more severe \u2013 rules for women.\nOn Friday morning, the Dogs announced that they would not seek an injunction in the supreme or federal court. But then came the kicker. In an unexpected move, the club announced that Brennan is lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the suspension was unlawful on human rights grounds.\nThe Commission will not deal with the case before the grand final this weekend. Brennan will not play. But the lodging of a human rights complaint is a strategic masterstroke that forces the AFL into an impossible position. Here\u2019s why: the Commission is an independent third party, whose job is to investigate human rights complaints and to help parties resolve their disputes. The Commission will ask the AFL to consider the specifics of Brennan\u2019s complaint, before overseeing a conciliation. There, Brennan will sit down with the AFL to air her concerns and the Commission will try to help them both come to a resolution.\nBrennan will almost certainly demand three things from the AFL: that they admit the tribunal system unfairly discriminates against women; that they overhaul the system so that the rules are fair and no other woman will be put in Brennan\u2019s position again; and finally, that her suspension be wiped from the historic record, as a matter of principle.\nIf the AFL does not accede, Brennan can go to the federal court and seek a hearing. The AFL will be taking a huge risk if it allows things to go that far. It cannot afford a formal court hearing where such arguments are thrashed out by teams of lawyers, with QCs getting paid hourly rates comparable to an entire season\u2019s wage for many of the women. \nBrennan grand final suspension shows AFLW needs stand-alone tribunal Read more \nIt would be a public relations disaster for the AFL, and generate significant bad blood with players and fans, including the new audience it has found through the AFLW. Most of all, the AFL cannot afford to risk the chance of a formal federal court finding that its fledgling AFLW competition \u2013 a pillar of its putative commitment to gender equality and equal opportunity for women \u2013 is inherently discriminatory. It would be a disastrous result for CEO Gil McLachlan, and one that he will be desperate to avoid.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s almost certain that the AFL will capitulate at the first hurdle, and accede to some \u2013 and perhaps all \u2013 of Brennan\u2019s demands at conciliation. The AFL will be asked to admit that its system \u2013 while well-intentioned \u2013 wasn\u2019t perfect and produced a perverse result that has left Brennan on the wrong side of history. Her move is a hugely significant one, not just for current AFLW footballers, but for future generations of girls and women who will play the game. A star on the field, Brennan has now laid down a huge challenge to the code off it. The ball is now in the AFL\u2019s court. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics AFLW Australian rules football Australia sport comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie brennan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriet cordner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sport western bulldogs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "human rights commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aflw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T03:23:56.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44940e0691748b3e331ba0d45e9ac14340e7b7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i_EGca3Aw3P7S2DLLEMrfppFjS77XtSnUbvApbb0NNrILZpW5dVxhAGjk96oaWcHgOKTpKf3.UYQVD9ngBd46sPTEZJ3pu9UHYsgvkiTYUXgw--", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au//news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "title_full": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "published": "2018-03-25T02:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9128120-16x9-700x394.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 722, "comments": 0, "shares": 722}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44940e0691748b3e331ba0d45e9ac14340e7b7e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80.l2Zef1N_T6zeCFQfEmRi7zMxr5z2i_EGca3Aw3P7S2DLLEMrfppFjS77XtSnUbvApbb0NNrILZpW5dVxhAGjk96oaWcHgOKTpKf3.UYQVD9ngBd46sPTEZJ3pu9UHYsgvkiTYUXgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Conifer", "published": "2018-03-25T02:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Government commits almost $70 million to fight against paedophiles", "text": "The ACCCE will also include members of the financial intelligence agency AusTrac and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. \nThe AFP's child protection operations will also grow from about 100 to 170 staff by mid-2020. \n\"This will have a big impact,\" Mr Dutton said. \n\"As any parent knows, we want to make sure we take care of our children, we want to make sure that we eliminate this threat from our society.\" \nThe $68.6 million boost will be included in May's budget. \nShadow Justice Minister Clare O'Neil said Labor welcomed any extra funding to protect children. \n\"Labor is absolutely committed to keeping children safe,\" Ms O'Neil said \n\"We were very concerned by cuts to the AFP in recent years, which the commissioner himself said were affecting the AFP's discretionary work, including their child exploitation work.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan conifer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter dutton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turnbull government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commonwealth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian federal police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "criminal intelligence commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T04:43:47.096+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e371974af900a89abddde1ce7ab0dd740c3e5879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5XXeFXTk11mTUs7NkZF3X6llCpdpJdkoB2CoyrwqvvDQ0P5o4H7dER8BOnpWFK9MDDdvPlghiUqCQPuumKSdLKBZv0IZwj12xOs9c1Q7p7MJfJCcWmFRsqpQpQtTsJkXntlCUfYe2Xa.9y1.UEOfQIoSGkw4G3sLOQpxgrVKxmt6uD5E86x9NHeexYgS.IoQ10x9HJGjH80yoaOVvoINY", "site_full": "www.foxsports.com.au", "site": "foxsports.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl", "site_categories": ["rugby", "sports"], "section_title": "NRL | NRL Live Scores | NRL Ladder &amp;

For the 61-year-old, his day revolves around a single six hour \u201ceating window\u201d between 1pm and 7pm, where he will consume around 2500 calories. \nThe remaining 18 hours of the day is for fasting \u2014 where only water, black coffee and green tea is allowed. \n\u201cThe underlying problem with obesity is insulin,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBy eating regularly throughout the day, the body isn\u2019t given an opportunity to bring insulin levels back down to zero. Instead, the levels are always elated. Carbohydrates, which turn in to sugar, keep that level up. \n\u201cThis leads to insulin intolerance which means to receive that spike in energy levels, the body needs to have more glucose.\u201d media_camera Dr Renaut says forget breakfast, and use the time in the morning to work out. \nInsulin is produced by the pancreas, and is a main regulator for sugar levels in the blood. When we eat, glucose levels rise, and insulin is released into the bloodstream. Often, insulin is dubbed as the \u2018key\u2019 to energy levels, because it opens up cells so they can take in the sugar and use it as an energy source. \nDr Renaut said we need to allow our body to stop insulin production for a large potion of the day to allow our cells to use up the fatty acids instead. \n\u201cAll the diets concentrate on the amount of food we eat, and that is the least important because that\u2019s not what\u2019s increasing insulin,\u201d he said. \n\u201cOnce upon a time, man would go days without food. They wouldn\u2019t wake up and say \u2018what\u2019s for breakfast\u2019. \n\u201cNow, some people have around six meals a day which means the insulin levels never drop to zero. \n\u201cWhen it comes to food, there are three main factors: How much do we eat, what type of food we eat, and the amount that we eat. Of those three, the most important is when we eat it.\u201d media_camera Dr Renaut said to restrict eating to a six hour window. \nA recent study by the University of Surrey, which was published in the British Journal of Nutrition this month , showed that not only can intermittent energy restriction assist with weight loss, it will also clear fat from the blood quicker after eating meals than daily calorie restriction diets. \nThe study, which only used a very small sample size of participants, the group were assigned to either the 5:2 diet or a daily calorie restriction diet and were required to lose five per cent of their weight. \nThose on the 5:2 diet ate normally for five days and for their two fasting days consumed just 600 calories. Those on the daily diet were advised to eat 600 calories less per day than their estimated requirements for weight maintenance (in the study women ate approx. 1400 calories and men ate approx. 1900 calories each day). \nThe research showed that those on the 5:2 diet achieved 5 per cent weight-loss in 59 days compared to those on the daily calorie restriction diet who achieved their goal in 73 days. \nAccording to the Australian Food Standards Code , a balanced diet for an average adult is made up of 8,700 kilojoules of energy, 50 grams of protein, 70g of fat, 24g of saturated fatty acids, 310g of carbohydrates, 90g of sugars, 2.3g of sodium (salt) and 30g of fibre. media_camera Dr Andrew Renaut says the key to losing weight is by only eating six hours daily. \nBut as part of the plan, which Dr Renaut said is not a \u2018diet\u2019 but rather a \u2018method of eating\u2019, means breakfast is off the menu. \n\u201cPeople need to stop eating for a significant amount of the day and stop eating refined carbs,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when you do the feeding window, but later in the day tends to be easier for people. You still need to consume the same amount of calories you normally would \u2014 so 2000 for women and 2500 for men \u2014 and you\u2019re not restricting anything except for carbohydrates.\u201d \nFor Dr Renaut, a day on a plate usually consists of fresh fish, meat and poultry, cheese, vegetables and dairy. He doesn\u2019t include any for of carbohydrate, including bread and pasta. \n\u201cI think this eating plan is something everyone could do,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBy not restricting, you\u2019re not running the risk of running in to deficiency because there\u2019s nothing out of the diet except for carbohydrates.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vanessa brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renaut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew renaut", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T02:37:08.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 563, "moreResultsAvailable": 553, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=e0e8b2b9-80ce-4cdc-bde9-b730ada6c3f9&format=json&ts=1521746604492&q=language%3Aenglish+site_type%3Anews+thread.country%3AAU+location%3ABrisbane&sort=relevancy&from=10&size=10", "requestsLeft": 844, "extra": {"place": "Brisbane", "country": "AU", "lat": "-27.4697707", "lng": "153.0251235"}}
