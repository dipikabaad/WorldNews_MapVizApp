The survey operated from August 2017 to February 2018, covering more than 500 airports and evaluating traveller experiences across different airport service and product key performance indicators - from check-in, arrivals, transfers, shopping, security and immigration through to departure at the gate.\u00b4 Photo: The award was handed out in Passenger Terminal Expo in Stockholm, Sweden on 21 March 2018 to Finavias Chief Digital Officer Heikki Koski.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "northern europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "best airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern europe helsinki airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:36:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfa77916b4683d6c288b0b5fa8ddb99b066ac235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JBGOR4EFzssoHjtk.l040w.oEk5K5f_8oqp0iIM3G6xeJL2BJcYlMdqTgKqevcXt8-", "site_full": "eleanorclaudie.com", "site": "eleanorclaudie.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "what I learnt from going on a new clothes ban | eleanor claudie | Bloglovin\u2019", "title_full": "what I learnt from going on a new clothes ban | eleanor claudie | Bloglovin\u2019", "published": "2018-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/eleanorclaudie.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ootd.jpg?fit=242%2C350", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfa77916b4683d6c288b0b5fa8ddb99b066ac235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JBGOR4EFzssoHjtk.l040w.oEk5K5f_8oqp0iIM3G6xeJL2BJcYlMdqTgKqevcXt8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "what I learnt from going on a new clothes ban | eleanor claudie | Bloglovin\u2019", "text": "what I learnt from going on a new clothes ban \nThis spending ban that I have partaken in since the start of January (in fact the last piece of new clothing that made its way into my wardrobe was on Christmas Day thanks to a few Paloma Wool goodies) was partly as a result of a need to save up for a Stockholm trip that has now been bought for May ahhh, but also because I know I don\u2019t need any new pieces in my wardrobe and I know there are more than enough unloved items of clothing that I don\u2019t wear to college or at the weekend for work that could be so easily integrated into my everyday wear. \nIt was around this time last year, or perhaps a bit before, when I started to get more serious about where I was actually buying from, why and the long term use of garments that I would buy in the future. Six months on I wrote a post about where my ethical buying had bought me, in terms of what I was buying and what I still wanted to change in terms of my buying habits. One aspect that I know I did find harder was to stop buying pieces that I knew I wasn\u2019t going to wear for years to come, not necessarily trend-led but either the material wasn\u2019t as long lasting as I wanted it to be or I knew I would look at it in a year or so and question: now why did I buy that piece again? \nNow I\u2019m wearing my own clothes everyday for college I actually thought it would be a lot harder not to buy any new clothes but actually it\u2019s reinforced how many clothes I actually own. When I used to go on a \u2018clothing haul\u2019 I used to go for the one in, one out but I think that probably showed me, more than anything that I had too many clothes in my wardrobe and whilst the \u2018one in, one out\u2019 rule did limit my spending because I didn\u2019t have a need to get rid of clothes, I really didn\u2019t actually need to buy them either \u2013 the argument for buying new clothes became somewhat circular for me (much like Descartes\u2019 argument for God being circular and succumbing to the Cartesian circle, philosophy revision right there). So alas this clothing ban began\u2026 and what have I learnt from it? Clothing ban results analysis (because this could be considered an experiment?) I spend a lot of money on books and food. After I decided I was going on a clothing ban and bought the trip to Stockholm, the money that I have saved up since and consequently spent have seemed to have disappear down a foodie hole or indeed provide a means to propagate my reading addiction further. Upon reflection, if I want to save I need to make use of my school library more and perhaps bring packed lunch instead of buying from the college cafeteria (I may even have to resist the butternut squash and sweet potato soup). Needless to say, I think I\u2019m more likely to start getting books from the school library than I am to bring in food. The ban worked! I actually stuck to it and it\u2019s been a nice refresher in my wardrobe, I\u2019ve rediscovered pieces I haven\u2019t worn in a while, made use of the clothes I already own and I didn\u2019t come to the common dilemma of \u2018I have no clothes to wear\u2019 when I\u2019m planning my outfits for college, fab times. It\u2019s made me more reflective about my purchases going forward. The next time I buy a piece of clothing, I think/know/hope it\u2019ll be a long lasting piece among the clothes I already own whether it be a seasonal buy for summer or a versatile garment. If you\u2019re not sure whether you want to buy ethically or not, I think giving yourself time to assess what you wear already is the perfect opportunity to think about what you\u2019d like, or perhaps need to buy in the future. yellow gingham trousers , short sleeved bodysuit , wavy ring , striped dungarees , white denim jacket , blou t-shirt \nThere are a few things that have been on my mind to buy for a while although I am trying to save up for shopping in Stockholm because I know they have some really nice vintage and ethical stores there and I am SO looking forward to try on before I buy because shopping online is always a gamble even if it has been so far so good with purchases I have bought. The Acey have a new spring collection out and I adore these striped dungarees , they could be worn as trousers under a jumper for colder months or under a t-shirt in spring and I <3 them. Also, a little shout out to Lima Lima for creating the most gorgeous ring, it\u2019s so cute and I\u2019ve had my eye on it for a while so I may have to cave in. \nHave you ever been on a clothing ban and what has it taught you? Or, if you\u2019re currently on one \u2013 are you finding it hard at all and how long do you want it to last? I think a new clothes ban is always good to find out what you really want out of your wardrobe and assess why you buy clothes, I know it certainly has confirmed that when I do buy new pieces for my wardrobe they\u2019re going to be much more loved than my new purchases were before. \nlots of love, eleanor xx ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-03-25T15:00:34.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4242e254f159389cb94e448ca280ff5736b07aa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6xmjGCLhD.kHDJtdcX_GiNLe5mTWifXVN3CIaeUeZ5MXYldTYcifW7F7u4Lx3t7c-", "site_full": "www.diamyd.com", "site": "diamyd.com", "site_section": "http://www.diamyd.com/rssNews.aspx", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Diamyd Events & Mediawatch", "title": "Fri, 23 Mar, 2018 - Sweden - Videoinspelning fr\u00e5n Feminvests H\u00e5llbarhetsturn\u00e9 i Stockholm", "title_full": "Fri, 23 Mar, 2018 - Sweden - Videoinspelning fr\u00e5n Feminvests H\u00e5llbarhetsturn\u00e9 i Stockholm", "published": "2018-03-23T19:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4242e254f159389cb94e448ca280ff5736b07aa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6xmjGCLhD.kHDJtdcX_GiNLe5mTWifXVN3CIaeUeZ5MXYldTYcifW7F7u4Lx3t7c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-03-23T19:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fri, 23 Mar, 2018 - Sweden - Videoinspelning fr\u00e5n Feminvests H\u00e5llbarhetsturn\u00e9 i Stockholm", "text": "March 23, 2018 Sweden Videoinspelning fr\u00e5n Feminvests H\u00e5llbarhetsturn\u00e9 i Stockholm Bolagspresentation med Diamyd Medicals vd Ulf Hannelius inspelad den 8/3 2017 p\u00e5 Feminvests H\u00e5llbarhetsturn\u00e9 i Stockholm.

In her speech, Mrs Andersson emphasised the importance of establishing global legal mechanisms regarding supply chain information for hazardous chemicals in products and production. \nReferring to ChemSec\u2019s experience from working with chemically progressive companies like Apple, IKEA and H&M, she explained how legally binding agreement would improve the situation immensely. Having such mechanisms in place, these companies at the end of the supply chain can do more than merely asking what chemicals are used in their products and supply chains; they can demand to know, which is a big difference. \n\u201cThe possibility to make demands along the supply chain regarding unwanted substances would not only benefit the finished product and the people who buy it \u2013 it would also create a much safer working environment and reduce health issues connected to chemicals in the producing countries. It really is a win-win scenario for everyone\u201d , Andersson said. \nThe high-level meeting included selected environmental ministers, CEOs of leading companies and scientists, and was held in conjunction with the SAICM working group meeting, where the global \u2018Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management\u2019 after 2020 was discussed. \nAndersson also stressed the need to get the issue of hazardous chemicals higher on policy and corporate agendas. The issue should have the same attention as climate change, also at events such as the World Economic Forum. While acknowledging the need for globally binding regulation she also emphasised the continued need for improving national and regional regulations. \n\u201cWe all agree that the world needs to act now, that the ambition level must be raised and that a global deal is needed. Strong and committed leadership from both the political area and the business sector is required to achieve this. The cost of inaction is enormous and many lives can be saved through global measures in the area\u201d , the minister Karolina Skog said in a press release from the Swedish government following the event.
