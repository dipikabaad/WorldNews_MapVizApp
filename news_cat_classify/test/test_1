Congratulations are in order! Stanley Tucci is going to be a dad again, as his wife, Felicity Blunt, is pregnant with the couple's second child. 
The duo has not publicly spoken out about their baby on the way, so it's unclear how far along the literary agent is. Instead of making a verbal public announcement, the couple let Felicity's baby bump speak for itself during Guggenheim Museum's screening of Final Portrait in NYC on Thursday, March 22. At the special event, Felicity's sister Emily Blunt and her good friend Blake Lively were seen rubbing her pregnant belly. 
Stanley, 57, and Felicity, 36, previously met at Emily's wedding to John Krasinski in 2010, just one year after Stanley's first wife, Kate Tucci, sadly died. They got engaged in Berlin a year after Emily and John's nuptials and exchanged vows in a private ceremony in 2012. They welcomed their son, Matteo, 3, in January 2015. The Devil Wears Prada star is also a dad to three older children, twins Nicolo and Isabel, and daughter Camilla from his previous marriage. 
In a previous interview with Reuters , Stanley joked he wishes parenthood was a simple as his father role in Easy A . "As a parent, it would be great if I could be as relaxed as these people in the movie are," he laughed. "It’ll never happen. But a thing that I have in common with Dill is that I do joke around with my kids. We laugh a lot. But again, I couldn’t let go that much — no way." (Photo Credit: Getty Images) 
However, Stanley's kids tend not to watch their famous dad in his films. "My kids don’t really like to watch me in movies," he added. "They just want me to be me. They’re great kids. They’re incredible. And they’re all really funny. Thank God." We can't wait to meet his fifth bundle of joy very soon! More from Closer Weekly
