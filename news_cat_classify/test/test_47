FASHION photographer Oliver Blohm is offering portrait sessions at the Lobby at Ace Hotel London Shoreditch next week. The Berlin-based photographer is known for his surreal portraits that look as if they have been painted. His images have been exhibited worldwide and he was named as one of Berlin’s new artists to watch by Zitty Magazine in 2016 for his unconventional approach to analog photography.

In addition to being able to keep one original polaroid, Blohm will save a copy of their picture to be featured in a future exhibition.
