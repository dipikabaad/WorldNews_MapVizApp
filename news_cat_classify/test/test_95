Wes Anderson and His Collaborators Talk 'Isle of Dogs' and Pretending to Be Someone You're Not
11 hours ago The auteur and Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura on their latest, and maybe best, film. 
It’s the day after the premiere of Isle of Dogs, and the Hotel Adlon in Berlin is overrun with the people who made it. Jeff Goldblum is appearing and reappearing in increasingly garish shirts. Bill Murray is talking about the arduousness of this press trip with the wild coif of a man who hasn’t gotten much post–premiere party sleep. Bob Balaban is sarcastically describing his shoes as “vintage.” People keep crossing paths as they make their way in and out of the GQ photo shoot and the rest of their obligations at the Berlin Film Festival, familially bumping each other and continuing on to their next tasks like extremely glamorous ants. Bryan Cranston needs to duck next door to be photographed with the puppet for his character, Chief, surprisingly heavy from the fully articulated metal dog skeleton beneath its matted fur. Greta Gerwig is en route to the BAFTAs, where her film Lady Bird is up for a bunch of awards. And lucky Tilda Swinton is getting ready to hop on a train to Zurich with the man who brought everyone here: Wes Anderson . But before that happens, the most meticulous auteur in cinema needs to sit down with co-creators Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura to discuss Isle of Dogs, his most ambitious film yet. 
GQ : Your live-action work can have the feeling of being autobiographical—like, you’re from Texas, and Bottle Rocket and Rushmore were filmed or set there. But I wonder if it’s actually more personal to do something that’s wholly from your brain, like Isle of Dogs, rather than re-creating or evoking things that really happened to you. 
Wes Anderson: When Jason and I did Rushmore together, the setting was my [alma mater, St. John's School in Houston], and it's very close-to-home kind of stuff. But over the years, it's sort of like the story kind of takes you where it takes you. 
Roman Coppola: What came into my mind is that oftentimes, when we're beginning, we'll say, "Do you ever have this kind of experience or that kind of experience?" I guess we don't see it as making this thing that's a flight of fancy from your imagination, but as rather personal. 
But Wes, when you're asked, "What does this clearly autobiographical detail from one of your films mean about your life?" you respond with something like, "Well, just because Anjelica Huston had the same profession as my mother and wore my mother's actual glasses in The Royal Tenenbaums —" 
Anderson: "Doesn't mean she's my mother." 
Yeah. And it reminded me of Jason Schwartzman's character in The Darjeeling Limited, where he keeps, obviously somewhat untruthfully, insisting— 
Anderson: "The characters are all fictional." Yes. 
I feel like Isle of Dogs is maybe the first movie where no one's going to be like, "Was that your dog? What does this say about you, Wes?" 
Anderson: Yes. Well, I actually did have a dog named Chief. A black dog named Chief. [ Jason Schwartzman enters and, despite the ample seating available, sits cross-legged on the floor. ] I'm sure there are lots of characters that draw something from our own experience, but I think you're right. There's not any character in Isle of Dogs who you could say, "This one is this person" or something like that. 
But I'm not sure. In Moonrise Kingdom , which Roman and I worked on together, I'm not sure who is from [real life]—I mean, Suzy Bishop is the name of a girl I knew in the second grade. And Sammy Shakusky is real. He was a kid who was younger than I was, but in our carpool. 
A bit of an odd bird? 
Anderson: He was odd. But my recollection of Sammy Shakusky is very blurry and faint and distant. Like, I probably knew him when he was five. 
Coppola: In Moonrise Kingdom, there was kind of a fantasy element of recalling when you were 11 or 12 and how you felt and what you wished would have happened rather than what actually happened. But it's true— Isle of Dogs is a little more fanciful and not so, so, so many elements that I can think of are linked to experience. 
Anderson: In Moonrise Kingdom, we didn't say [the way we had to with Isle of Dogs ], "Where does the government convene?" We didn't have a police force to invent. 
Coppola: But we did have the sheriff. 
Anderson: Yeah, we had Bruce Willis. 
"So often in movies, the tradition is just to work and then separate between takes or between days. You just don't even get to know anybody, which is the whole joy of it." 
Your movies all do have this quality of invented realism, where you're making something that's not faithful to reality but feels realer than the real thing. The Royal Tenenbaums is more New York than New York. Moonrise Kingdom is more island town than an island town, or more Boy Scouts than the Boy Scouts. 
Jason Schwartzman: A bit exaggerated, probably. 
It's like re-creating your memory of something, rather than doing the research, almost makes it more vivid. 
Schwartzman: Have you seen the app where they were taking kids' drawings and animate them? Or heard of the fantastic organization Story Parts? 
Is that when a kid writes a play and adults come and act it out with great seriousness? 
Schwartzman: Yeah! 
That's exactly how Wes's movies feel. You know, it's so nice to have all four of you here, because so many of the films are about groups of people—the Boy Scouts or a family or a ship's crew or, in the case of Isle of Dogs, a dog pack. You seem to be a pack creature in real life, Wes. 
Anderson: I don't even know if I am. I tend to often just stay home. Making Isle of Dogs , I worked mostly from my computer, usually alone. Sometimes I would have my editor or a music editor or someone work with me. I went off to work with the composer [Alexandre Desplat]. I sometimes had to go to the studio. But really, I'm kind of usually on my own. Watch Bill Hader Remembers the Time He Met Tom Cruise 
Every time I've heard you talk about working alone, you've described it as torturous. 
Anderson: Well, writing alone is very challenging for me. Sometimes I am working on the script alone, but with the Moonrise Kingdom script, I had started on my own and was really stuck. I asked Roman to help me because of two things. First, Roman is very analytical. He just has a very quick read and then usually a menu of ideas. And when we are all together working, it keeps me in the game. It keeps us focused or something. 
Coppola: You said "pack animal." Wes will often get a house. Like in Görlitz [where The Grand Budapest Hotel was shot], we all took over a hotel and had a chef. 
Anderson: We were at the Hotel Versa. 
Coppola: There's a—I don't want to say instinct, but a pleasure taken in having a group of people. Being on this trip [to the Berlin Film Festival] and seeing Jeff Goldblum and Bill Murray and everyone gathered, there is a nice camaraderie. 
Schwartzman: Wes goes through a great effort. So often in movies, the tradition is just to work and then separate between takes or between days. You just don't even get to know anybody, which is the whole joy of it. I remember the first movie, Rushmore , working together and how great it was. We all lived down the hall from each other. When I worked after that, I felt such a vacancy. 
And [on Grand Budapest ], Wes got that little hotel in Görlitz instead of having all of these people staying in apartments or however a traditional movie would do it. The actors get to know each other. You're sort of living in the world of the movie as a unit. 
Anderson: I think all that stuff came from when we were doing Darjeeling Limited . Roman had some particular ideas at the beginning, like no makeup department—it should be like the theater, where the actors do their own makeup. We tried to do that, but we didn't entirely because some people want makeup. 
Coppola: We wired mics into the clothing. 
Schwartzman: We had to be somewhat responsible for our own continuity. Like, "Adrien [Brody], your glasses were on your head in this scene." 
Anderson: Also we started doing the thing where your costume is in your room. It's been pressed overnight, and when you wake up, it's there. You get dressed into your clothes and go to the set in character. You don't have a trailer. You don't have any place to go before. You just go straight to the set and you stay there. That was a good thing we started doing then, which we still do. 
Schwartzman: For my brain, it's the best, because you don't have to force yourself to be focused. He creates the whole environment. 
Jeff Goldblum had a really beautiful line about this. He said, "The communal enjoyment of all these actors and artisans is an art piece in itself." 
Schwartzman: Well, I guess that's basically what I said, but in one sentence. 
Wes, you said everybody keeps you going and you're in it together, but what are the rest of your roles in this little group? 
Coppola: I like to be the control tower whenever possible. We just learned this term recently. When Kurosawa did his writing, there'd be a group of people, and some people would be concerned with the dialogue, and others idea generation. And one of the writers was called the control tower, who would kind of vet ideas or guide it and shape it as you tried to get it past him. 
Anderson: Redirect. 
Coppola: Yeah, kind of redirect some straight ideas. 
Anderson: But I feel like we don't really have different roles; we just work together. I mean, in Isle of Dogs we have a different thing. When Kun became a part of it, suddenly we had one person among the four who actually speaks the language [Japanese] that half of the movie is going to be in. 
No pressure. 
Nomura: It was really a burden in a way. Because if I explained, "This is how it should be," the only thing he could say was, "Okay, I trust you." Maybe if I said it in English, he would say, "I've got to talk to Jason or Roman. Kun, you are wrong." But this one, he can't do that. I'm the only Japanese [person] he would communicate to, so I had to double-check everything. 
Anderson: He told me as soon as he read the first pass [on Isle of Dogs 's screenplay], "This is a perfectly reasonable translation, but it does not sound like your work." And so at a certain point, I only trust Kun to really know what's right for us. But I never felt like, "Oh, I'm uncomfortable with him having this power." I mean, Kun directed a lot of the performances that are in Japanese. 
Nomura: Wes doesn't understand what they are actually saying. 
Anderson: It could be a whole different movie! 
Nomura: I was really worried. 
Schwartzman: Is this a cry for help? 
Nomura: No, it's not. But when somebody really trusts you, you want to pay them back for that trust. 
Anderson: You want to get it right. [But] don't worry. GET THE
