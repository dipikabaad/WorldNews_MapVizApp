German Chancellor Wants Sovereignty for Individuals after Facebook Data Leak
BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Wednesday for individuals to be placed at the center of the debate in the aftermath of a Facebook data breach, and proposed giving each internet user sovereignty over their personal data.
Merkel made her comments during her first speech after securing her fourth mandate as chancellor in which she outlined the guidelines of the legislature and her cabinet.
Germany and the European Union must place the individual at the center of the debate, said Merkel, adding that individuals should have sovereignty over their personal data as well as a right to decide how it is used.
The social network was under fire after it was revealed it allegedly supplied the personal data of 50 million users to a company linked to United States President Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign.
Merkel considered the EU had a long road ahead regarding the matter and that recently passed EU legislation was merely a first step.
