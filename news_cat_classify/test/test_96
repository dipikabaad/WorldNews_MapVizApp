Why Trump’s Trade Policies May Resurrect COMECON
Editor’s note: To listen click here 5:06 David Brancaccio 
Note that when the White House hit China yesterday with as much as $60 billion in trade sanctions, at the same time the United States said the recent steel and aluminum tariffs will not apply to some allies – including the the European Union and Brazil. 
Securing ad hoc custom deals on trade has a retro, Cold-War feel to some. In Berlin, Stephan Richter is editor-in-chief of the online publication The Globalist, and he has a reminder that something called COMECON was more than just a comic book trade show. Hi Stephan. 5:36 Stephan Richter 
Hi David. 5:38 David Brancaccio 
Alright, so one terms bilateral two countries working out their trade rules. But you think there is a kind of “Back to the Future” aspect to this? 5:45 Stephan Richter 
Well it’s back to the past, of course. This is almost Old Testament. It’s called the COMECON. Few people will remember, but it was a very powerful economic organization that the Soviet Union set up, the so-called Council for Mutual Economic Assistance where the Soviets called all the shots on all the product flows. Everything was bilateral. 
And if you were Cuba you were told to deliver 90% of your grapefruit production to Moscow, and for that you got maybe some trucks out of East German production or something. 
But we know that the Soviet Union collapsed, and one big part was that it was never productive in terms of export goods and all the like. So it’s really something one shouldn’t go to, but Donald Trump seems to be hell-bent on going there and that’s a worry for people all over the world. 6:38 David Brancaccio 
Alright, but these are not vassal countries the United States wants to deal with. There has to be some level of two-way street, an actual negotiation. 6:46 Stephan Richter 
Correct. And the big hope right now is, that with regard to China, if after the overture with aluminum and steel they focused on finding smart ways to tell the Chinese we live in a global market and they need to keep up their side of the bargain. Then it would all of a sudden turn into a big hooray for Donald Trump. 7:07 David Brancaccio 
Stephan Richter, editor-in-chief of The Globalist. He’s in Berlin. Stephan — always good to talk to you. 7:11 Stephan Richter
