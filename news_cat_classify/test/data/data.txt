      "text": "Get our Fabulous Newsletter Did you mean: ? By signing up I agree to the Privacy Policy . I also agree to receive periodic emails from Closer Weekly based on my interests. \nWoo hoo! \nYour life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits! \nCongratulations are in order! Stanley Tucci is going to be a dad again, as his wife, Felicity Blunt, is pregnant with the couple's second child. \nThe duo has not publicly spoken out about their baby on the way, so it's unclear how far along the literary agent is. Instead of making a verbal public announcement, the couple let Felicity's baby bump speak for itself during Guggenheim Museum's screening of Final Portrait in NYC on Thursday, March 22. At the special event, Felicity's sister Emily Blunt and her good friend Blake Lively were seen rubbing her pregnant belly. \nStanley, 57, and Felicity, 36, previously met at Emily's wedding to John Krasinski in 2010, just one year after Stanley's first wife, Kate Tucci, sadly died. They got engaged in Berlin a year after Emily and John's nuptials and exchanged vows in a private ceremony in 2012. They welcomed their son, Matteo, 3, in January 2015. The Devil Wears Prada star is also a dad to three older children, twins Nicolo and Isabel, and daughter Camilla from his previous marriage. \nIn a previous interview with Reuters , Stanley joked he wishes parenthood was a simple as his father role in Easy A . \"As a parent, it would be great if I could be as relaxed as these people in the movie are,\" he laughed. \"It’ll never happen. But a thing that I have in common with Dill is that I do joke around with my kids. We laugh a lot. But again, I couldn’t let go that much — no way.\" (Photo Credit: Getty Images) \nHowever, Stanley's kids tend not to watch their famous dad in his films. \"My kids don’t really like to watch me in movies,\" he added. \"They just want me to be me. They’re great kids. They’re incredible. And they’re all really funny. Thank God.\" We can't wait to meet his fifth bundle of joy very soon! More from Closer Weekly",

      "text": "Turkey rejects Angela Merkel’s criticism over Afrin offensive Deutsche Welle March 23, 2018\n10:00 am After Angela Merkel broke her silence on Turkey’s Afrin offensive and condemned the attack, Ankara rejected her stance as “unacceptable.” Merkel also decried the assault on Ghouta ahead of reports of evacuations.\nTurkey dismissed Angela Merkel’s statements on the Afrin offensive as “far from reality” and “based on disinformation” after the German chancellor slammed Turkey in Germany’s parliament.\nOn Wednesday, Merkel criticized Turkey’s attack on Kurdish forces in Syria’s Afrin, which Ankara describes as an anti-terror offensive.\n“Despite all justified security interests of Turkey, it’s unacceptable what’s happening in Afrin, where thousands and thousands of civilians are being pursued, are dying or have to flee,” Merkel told German lawmakers.\nWhile Berlin has repeatedly hinted at its displeasure since the Afrin offensive started two months ago, Merkel’s Wednesday remarks were the first time the chancellor herself clearly condemned the attack.\nMerkel also decried the attack on rebel strongholds in eastern Ghouta conducted by the Syrian regime forces. Specifically, she slammed Moscow for “just watching” the offensive that had reportedly claimed over 1,500 lives.\n“We also condemn this in the strongest possible terms,” she said.\nTurkish attack a ‘model’ operation\nResponding to Merkel’s comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely strange” that “some of our allies are looking at the situation through the eyes of terrorists.”\nTurkish diplomats said Merkel’s statement was “unacceptable.”\n“Operation Olive Branch is a role model on how to fight terrorism without inflicting civilian causalities,” the ministry said in a statement.\nTurkish forces and their allies seized Afrin on Sunday, but announced they would continue their offensive east of the town.\nRussian ultimatum\nMeanwhile, the Syrian regime was making gains in Ghouta as rebels agreed to give up the town of Harasta and evacuate after weeks of rocket fire and airstrikes. Damascus’ ally Russia negotiated the deal with the rebel group Ahrar al-Sham.\nDamascus was not directly involved in the talks, Syrian Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar told the AFP news agency. The agency also cited analyst Nawar Oliver, who claimed rebels were “not able to impose a single one of their conditions” on the evacuation agreement.\n“Russia told them: that’s what’s on the table. If you like it, welcome. If you don’t like it, we’ll carry on with our ground offensive,” he said.\nThousands evacuated from eastern Ghouta\nOn Thursday, Russia representative Vladimir Zolotukhin said over 5,000 civilians left eastern Ghouta through the specially arranged corridor. Separately, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said over 4,000 people fled from Douma, another rebel-controlled town in Ghouta, and entered into government territory.\nOn Thursday, a Syrian army officer urged all rebels in the area to give up their resistance.",

      "text": "Sports Football, power and politics at the 11mm Film Festival The opening night of the festival's 15th edition featured the screening of \"The Workers Cup.\" The film is a documentary about the lives of the migrants building the facilities for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. \nFootball is an extremely powerful tool that can be used to build bridges between cultures, but it can also be used as part of a propaganda machine in the hands of dodgy governments. The focus of this edition of the 11mm Football Film Festival in Berlin is \"football and power.\" \nHoping for change \nThe Workers Cup , a documentary directed by the American filmmaker Adam Sobel, was chosen for the opening ceremony. The audience packed into the Babylon cinema watched the story of migrants working in appalling conditions to build the stadiums for the 2020 World Cup in Qatar. \nWith intimate access and a sensitive approach, the film depicts the contrast between the shiny, luxurious world of the Qatari elite longing for the World Cup and the harsh reality of those men. \n\"We also showed it to the wives and families of the people in the film. I know for some of them it was quite shocking and sad, but they are still happy the story has been told and they hope it will create change,\" Rosie Garthwaite, one of the film's producers, told DW. \nGarthwaite and other members of the crew were experienced the state of human rights in Qatar first hand as they spent time in jail while trying to do their job. She said that the country had been coming under a lot of international pressure in recent years, and that the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency, was now active in Qatar through a technical cooperation program. \n\"However, we have seen before a lot of promises and no change, so now we just have to wait and see if these promises are put into action,\" Garthwaite added. \nRosie Garthwaite, producer of The Workers Cup \nCapitalism and diplomacy \nThe world’s biggest football film festival is to screen more than 60 films over five days. Among the documentaries on show are stories originating from or dealing with Argentina, Brazil, the former East Germany, Iran, Qatar, North Korea and Russia. \n\"I think you can separate football and politics at the amateur level, but it is impossible to do so when it comes to the professional game,\" Birger Schmidt, one of the directors of the festival, said. \"Football is a very honest art of capitalism, so there’s always politics in it.\" \n\"Football is also about diplomacy. For some countries, it is very important to be good at football because of the difficulties their citizens endure in their daily lives.\" \nAs the most popular sport in countless countries, football isn't just a reflection of people’s wishes and dreams but also their fears and animosities. In Turkey, for example, the ongoing tension between Turks and Kurds is depicted in Yesil Kirmizi (Green Red), a documentary by Ersin Kana focused on Amedspor, the local club of Turkey’s main Kurdish city, Diyarbakir. \n\"Football plays a huge role in the politics of Turkey,\" said Recep Bozgöz, author of Ronaldo , a Turkish short film that is also to be shown . He cites the example of the 2013 Gezi Park protests , where the fans of Istanbul’s three biggest clubs, Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, came together for the first time to express their opposition to the politics of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who at the time was Turkey's prime minister. \nOffside , a 2006 documentary by Jafar Pahani in which a woman dresses up like a man in order to watch an international match, highlights the dreadful state of women’s rights in Iran. \nBirger Schmidt addresses the audience \nAutocratic regimes and football \nGiven the fact that the World Cup in Russia is just weeks away, the 11mm Festival has a strong Russian presence. As part of the festival, the series \"Football in Russian Films\" - a set of films from historic and romantic comedies to social dramas - is to be screened at the Russian House for Culture and Science in Berlin. \nConcerns have been raised about how safe it is to attend football matches in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, where allegations of racism, homophobia and corruption are not uncommon. These concerns grew in light of incidents of violence involving Russian hooligans in Marseille during Euro 2016 . The short film Should you be afraid of the Russian World Cup? focuses on the issue. Another film dealing with hooliganism in Russia is Okolafutbola , a controversial documentary that was excluded from the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. \nFootball can be a powerful tool when it comes to winning the hearts and minds of a population - as autocratic leaders well know. \nOne of the most dramatic examples of this was the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, when the military junta that had taken over the country two years previously south to use the tournament as a PR stunt to legitimize its brutal regime. \nSimilarly, the German documentary WM-Sieg unter Folter (World Cup victory under torture) documents the memories of victims of the dictatorship from that World Cup, which Argentina won. \nThis year’s 11mm Football Film Festival brings together films from all around the world. \"We never thought we could get to the 15th edition when we started back in 2004,\" Schmidt. \"Football and films are still very interesting and now we have partners on every continent with festivals from Sydney to Oklahoma to Rio de Janeiro.\" DW recommends",

      "text": "Chris Ward Software Developer in Berlin, writing about tech, politics and mental health THE BLOG Remainers Need To Come Clean: A 'Deal Or Remain' Referendum Is Impossible Remainers may have never brazenly printed lies onto a bus, but if they dream of bringing the UK back into the European fold, they must do so with honesty 23/03/2018 16:03 GMT | Updated 22 hours ago Peter Nicholls / Reuters \nIt has been Liberal Democrat policy right from the beginning. Yet now Remainers across the political divide are slowly coalescing upon a “deal or remain” referendum as one of the few avenues to oppose Brexit without outright demanding for the referendum vote to be annulled. Today, Owen Smith has become the latest to demand the British people get a final say on the final deal. \nIt is a very politically-attractive strategy: they can legitimately dodge accusations that instead of frustrating democracy, they’re in fact demanding more of it. The only problem, obviously a tiny one, is that such a referendum would be impossible. \nFree trade agreements don’t happen quickly, as Remainers rightly argued in the referendum. The “final deal” will certainly not be available by March 2019, never mind months prior to that in time for a referendum. The transitional deal which, if it happens, will amount to “EU membership without a say” might be, but nobody is asking for a referendum on that. The EU’s deal with Canada took seven years from the beginning of negotiations to the conclusion and it was famously nearly killed off when a region of Belgium refused to sign up to it. Whatever Liam Fox says, negotiating a free-trade deal will be anything but “the easiest in human history”. \nThis leaves Remainers with two viable options. The first is to campaign for an extension of Article 50, which would of course have to be mutually agreed by the British government and the EU27. Currently, not even the Lib Dems are pursuing this. The second is to accept that by the time any deal will be near completion, Brexit will have already happened. There is, in that scenario, no possible way it can be “cancelled”. \nBecoming a member of the European Union following Brexit means reapplying under the provisions of Article 49 - the same article under which any other country applies to become a member of the EU. This will take years and any suggestion of a fast-track relies upon the goodwill of those running the Union at that time. It’s no good pointing to the generous words of Juncker and Barnier when in 2019 the EU27 will appoint an entirely new Commission, the people will elect an entirely new Parliament and that Parliament will elect an entirely new EU Commission President. \nUnder the “reapplication” scenario, there is absolutely no way Britain will enjoy the very generous exemptions and rebates it had previously as an EU member and, if it tries to negotiate them, they’ll find more opposition than just the Walloon region of Belgium. \nToday’s good soundbite means very little if it achieves nothing in the long run. If Remainer politicians want to oppose Brexit, there are means of doing so, but not one of them will give them the political ease of this logically impossible demand for a “Deal or Remain” referendum. Remainers may have never brazenly printed lies onto a bus, but if they dream of bringing the UK back into the European fold, they must do so with honesty.

He has become such a fan favorite that he now makes his own red carpet appearances, rich owner in tow.\nGidget, the 12-pound chihuahua known for the ubiquitous catchphrase, “Yo quiero Taco Bell!” was propelled to stardom after landing the lucrative fast-food campaign in the late ’90s. She also starred as Bruiser’s mom in 2003’s “Legally Blonde 2” alongside Reese Witherspoon .\nBrigitte, a five-year-old French bulldog “actress,” best known for her role as Stella on ABC’s hit comedy “Modern Family,” won Best Dog in a Television Series at the inaugural Golden Collar Awards in 2012. Yes, that’s a thing.\nRecommended Video: Now Playing: Lisa Rinna of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills let loose on Erika in the streets of Berlin, Germany during their cast trip. Lisa's partner in crime Eileen Davidson recently left the show to focus on her acting career but Lisa is proving she can handle her role on the show and all the drama solo. The street explosion between Lisa and Erika was caught in pictures and was enough to cause Kyle to break it up between the pair. Could Lisa be the reason that married Erika began flirting with a mystery man in the bar? We hope Lisa spills the tea on the Berlin trip this coming season.\nMedia: Wochit Even though Sadie isn’t exactly a TV star, Oprah Winfrey ‘s cocker spaniel has been mentioned so many times on her show, she’s almost as famous as her gazillionaire owner. In 2009, Dogtime.com reported that Oprah set aside $30 million for her five dogs, including Sadie.\nCookie Frankel, “Real Housewives of New York” star Bethenny Frankel’s dog, has more than 25,000 followers on Twitter . The Lhasa apso gets regular massages and is constantly fed antioxidant-rich carrots. “Everyday is a spa day for her,” Bethenny has said.\n“Million Dollar Listing” star Fredrik Eklund insists his miniature dachshund, Fritzy, needs a big living room to play in. But Eklund is realistic, insisting he would never spend more than $2 million on his dog’s digs. Moderation is key, people.\nPal, the original Lassie, made $4,000 a week in 1954 or $51,000 in today’s world. Lassie has since been played by 10 generations of Pal’s descendants.\nMoose, the Jack Russell terrier who played Eddie on “Frasier,” earned a cool $10,000 per episode. In total, Eddie earned $3.2 million in his 11-year run. He also received more fan mail than any of his costars! Fun fact: Eddie’s biological son, Enzo, took over the role after his dad retired.\nFlame Jr., also known as Rin Tin Tin IV, starred in the TV hit ABC show “The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin” from 1954-59. The famed dog was responsible for increasing the popularity of German shepherds as family pets and was nominated for the American Humane Association’s PATSY Award for animal performers.\nFamous dogs on TV\nRead original story From Wags to Riches: 9 of TV’s Most Famous Dogs (Photos) At TheWrap",

With an enjoyable mix of melodic instruments and angelic singing delicately put together in its arrangement, the track consists of a soft and mellow chorus which combines naturally with the production.\nPromoting self-love and embracing who you are, this song is part of a journey towards an EP that will be recorded between London and Berlin, featuring vocalists such as Novaa, L Devine and B O K E H. Speaking on the track and the decision to work with CHU, the duo told Complex: \"We wanted to show the versatility of our productions. With the instrumental we had created, we needed someone who would fit perfectly with what we were trying to do—CHU was that person! What she added to the track was amazing, and we hope everyone likes it.\"\nTags: News , R&B , Complex UK , Blyne , Chu",

      "text": "DJ List is Revealed for the Infamous and Debaucherous Black Party Instinct Staff | March 23, 2018 @dannykrivit @djeddieelias @chriscruise @saintatlarge #blackparty2018 \nThe Saint at Large® presents Rites XXXIX: The Black Party® 2018 \"PIGTOPIA: I Want to Break Free\" is arriving in New York City in less than a month (April 21st), and the DJ's for one of the most infamous nights of the year has just been released. \nIn a world increasingly threatened by small minds and big politics, The Black Party steamrolls into its 39th year. Legendary, welcoming, intimidating and exclusive, Rites XXXIX: The Black Party continues to pierce the boundaries of queer culture. In other words, its a night that you truly will not remember, as it goes beyond anything you will find at a local gay bar and party. It's an extravaganza of dancing, insane performances, and so much more that is something to be tried out at least once in your life. \nThe five DJ's selected span the globe, with stateside appearances from men based in New York City all the way to Berlin, Germany. Take a look. \nFATHERHOOD (Batty Bass) New York City \nFatherhood is the perfect union of Michael Magnan and Physical Therapy; wherein two New York stalwarts join together to play a joyous high-energy take on house and techno. With many years of experience between the two, Fatherhood provides responsible selecting prowess and parental party guidance. They are known for their long ecstatic sets in NYC and in Europe at venues like Berlin's Panorama Bar. ( SoundCloud link here ). \nCHRIS CRUSE (SPOTLIGHT) Los Angeles \nChris Cruse is a Los Angeles-based DJ whose sound is equally influenced by dark warehouses and West Coast sunshine. Frequently playing events in the US and Europe, his mainstay is a party of his own creation, Spotlight, which aims to reclaim and celebrate the queer roots of house, techno, disco, and other forms of dance music. Despite abstaining from social media promotion and discouraging dance floor photography, Cruse’s Spotlight has quietly become the go-to event for underground music in LA thanks to its anything-goes vibe and consistent global bookings. ( SoundCloud link here ). \nEDDIE ELIAS (VERVE) San Diego \nEver since Eddie Elias played his first professional gig in 2000, the now San Diego-based, Dominican-born DJ has been wowing audiences in New York City and around the country with his unique sound and masterful mixing. Deep, progressive grooves are the foundation upon which Eddie builds his sets; where he goes from there depends on the crowd and his remarkably keen instincts. Whether he’s dramatically layering an improbable number of tracks during a peak hour performance before a crowd of thousands or working a single favorite record with focused precision at a more intimate after-hours, a night on his dance floor is one that won’t soon be forgotten. ( SoundCloud link here ). \nMASSIMILIANO PAGLIARA (Ostgut Ton) Berlin \nMassimiliano Pagliara was born in Tricase (Lecce) in the deep south of Italy. As a child, he listened to diverse types of music: rap, classical, reggae, dub and 60s rock’n’roll. Coming from this small village, he and his friends created a small musical world for themselves, spending time every day playing records in his basement and at private parties. Today, Massi spins at some of the most popular underground venues in Germany (among them Tape Club, Berghain/Panorama Bar, SchwuZ, Tresor (Berlin) as well as playing across the world. Massi describes his style as an eclectic mix of house, disco, electro and techno – one may call it current-yet-classic. DJing has since led to production, these days Massi has been collaborating with luminaries such as Gui.Tar, Snax, Lemercier & The Lala by, Molly Nilsson and Discodromo. ( SoundCloud link here ). \nDANNY KRIVIT (718 SESSIONS) New York City \nA New York DJ veteran with an endless list of credentials, Danny Krivit has been involved in his city's dance/club scene since childhood, and has had a profound impact upon it. In 1971, he began DJing at The Ninth Circle in the West Village and, as a regular at The Loft, began lifelong friendships with with DJs David Mancuso and Larry Levan. Throughout the 80s the list of clubs he played at grew to include Area, Danceteria, The Limelight, Save The Robots, Tracks, The Tunnel, The World, and a guest spot at the legendary Paradise Garage. Moving into the 90s, Danny commanded legendary status amongst young and old, DJing at Mars, Palladium, Shelter, Sound Factory Bar, Twilo, and The Loft. At its inception in 1996, Danny joined the Body and Soul team and has regularly played the party ever since. Since 2002, Krivit has been resident DJ at NYC’s soulful phenomenon, 718 Sessions.

(Photo: AFP) Berlin: Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has been linked to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich as a possible replacement for Jupp Heynckes next season.\nAccording to reports, Bayern's director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic has recommended Pochettino to club bosses Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness.\nCurrent head coach Heynckes, 72, has implied he will leave at the end of the season and magazine Sport Bild claims Salihamidzic has approached the Spurs boss.\n\"I know that Bayern have contacted Mauricio Pochettino,\" Sky pundit Didier Hamann told the German magazine.\n\"He was an option and possibly still is.\"\nHighly-rated Argentinian Pochettino, 46, has a contract at Spurs until 2021 and Tottenham president Daniel Levy is unlikely to let him go after nearly four years.\nBayern had been thought to want to hire a German-speaking coach.\n\"That doesn't have to be the case, if we said that we would automatically close a door -- and it's not closed,\" Salihamidzic has said on the matter.\nOther possible candidates to succeed Heynckes include ex-Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, currently without a club, and RB Leipzig handler Ralph Hasenhuettl.\nThe Austrian has been offered a contract extension past 2019, but negotiations with Leipzig are currently on ice.\nBayern chairman Rummenigge is also said to admire Nice coach Lucien Favre, who has a buy-out clause in his contract with the French Ligue 1 club.\nSwiss coach Favre, who has coached Bundesliga sides Hertha Berlin and Borussia Moenchengladbach, has proven he can work with big name stars, such as Mario Balotelli, who has scored 14 French league goals this season for Nice.",

      "text": "Bilingual Music: Kaleidoscopic soundscape — Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos 雙語音樂：千變萬化的聲音地景 巴赫《布蘭登堡協奏曲》 Holographic picture showing the title page of Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos in its original French title, meaning “Six concertos for several instruments.”這張全像圖展示出巴赫《布蘭登堡協奏曲》的標題頁，包含以法文寫下的原始標題「寫給幾把樂器的六首協奏曲」。 Photo: Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Public Domain圖片：柏林國家圖書館 \nOn March 24, 1721, Johann Sebastian Bach completed the Brandenburg Concertos for the Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt. \nThe concertos belong to the genre of concerto grosso, popular during the Baroque period. This was structured as the concertino small group of soloists playing instruments selected for their distinct color, accompanied by a larger group of instruments known as the ripieno. Playing together in contrast or in combination, the concertino section and the ripieno ensemble created a mixture of musical colors. \nBach is revered as the greatest composer of all time for his ability to consistently break the mold of tradition in ingenious ways. By selecting a wide range of instruments to stand out in different pieces within the collection, Bach was able to demonstrate his command of the distinctive voice of the instruments commonly used in court ensembles. \nIn Concerto No. 1, Bach immediately parts with convention by starting the whole collection with all instruments playing in concert, and achieves a sublime symphonic opening where the more intimate atmosphere typical of court chamber music would traditionally have been employed. The piece closes with a minuet, reminiscent of the elegance of traditional Baroque court music. \nBeing closest to the concerto grosso form, the concertino section in No. 2 is an eclectic selection of four instruments with very different sounds — a valveless natural trumpet with the sound of a hunting horn, the recorder, the oboe and the violin — creating a unique effect. \nIntriguingly, Concerto No. 3 is without a concertino, being a string ensemble accompanied by basso continuo: violin, viola, cello, with three of each, interweaving and conversing with one another. \nThe concertino section in Concerto No. 4 comprises two flauti d’echo (echo flutes) and a violin: The two woodwind instruments play in sequence and follow the violin melody, creating an echo effect. \nPerhaps Bach’s most audacious innovation appears in Concerto No. 5, in which the harpsichord, traditionally serving as accompaniment, takes the lead. In this, the whole piece paves the way for subsequent concertos for keyboard instruments. \nConcerto No. 6 once again lacks a concertino section, but this time is even without violins. The combination of violas and a variety of different Baroque viols creates a dark, brooding effect. \nThe Brandenburg Concertos were, essentially, Bach’s resume for applying to a position in the Prussian court to further his career. Once received, however, the manuscript was stored in the Margrave’s library, and was not to be published until more than a hundred years later, when the manuscript was rediscovered. They never would be played in the Margrave’s court. \n(Paul Cooper and Chang Ho-ming, Taipei Times) \n約翰‧塞巴斯蒂安‧巴赫在一七二一年三月二十四日完成《布蘭登堡協奏曲》，並將其獻給布蘭登堡-施韋特的伯爵。 \n就樂曲類型而言，這組協奏曲作品屬於巴洛克時期盛行的「大協奏曲」，由一小組樂器音色較為突出的獨奏家組成「獨奏部」，搭配規模較大的另一組「伴奏部」組成。兩個聲部一起演奏時，「獨奏部」與「伴奏部」既呈現出彼此音色的對比，時而合力齊奏，創造出千變萬化的音樂色彩。 \n巴赫之所以受後人尊崇為最偉大的作曲家，原因來自他屢屢能在陳舊的形式中另闢蹊徑。巴赫在整組作品裡面選用了各式各樣的樂器，讓它們在各曲中展現突出的音色，同時以此呈現自己對於宮廷樂團裡各種常見樂器的充分掌握。 \n在第一號協奏曲的開頭，巴赫率先跳出傳統框架，讓所有樂器一起演奏，塑造出宛如交響曲般的崇高氣質，藉以展開整組作品，迥異於宮廷室內樂典型的親密氛圍。音樂最後以小步舞曲收尾，讓人懷想傳統巴洛克宮廷音樂的優雅性格。 \n第二號協奏曲就形式而言最接近於「大協奏曲」，獨奏部卻特異地選擇四把音色截然不同的樂器──宛如狩獵號角、沒有音栓的自然小號，加上直笛、雙簧管，以及小提琴──創造出獨特的聲響效果。 \n第三號協奏曲令人玩味地不含獨奏部，取而代之的是一組弦樂團，附帶「數字低音」的伴奏：小提琴、中提琴，與大提琴各三把，互相交織、對話。 \n第四號協奏曲的獨奏部由兩把「回聲的笛子」與一把小提琴組成。在音樂中，兩把木管樂器互相應和，偶亦追隨小提琴的旋律，製造出回音般的效果。",

      "text": "European Union member states agreed at a summit in Brussels to take further punitive steps against Russia in the coming days for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, U.K., as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it.\nLate on Thursday, in a boost for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack on a former Russian spy and said it was \"highly likely\" Moscow was responsible. They also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia.\n\nRussian embassy calls Trudeau's criticism of Putin 'confrontational' EU recalls ambassador from Moscow over spy attack \n\"Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,\" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Paris and Berlin would be among countries taking further rapid and coordinated measures which other leaders said would include the expulsion of Russian officials and possible other retaliatory actions.\nStanding beside Macron and echoing his view that Russia had breached the sovereignty and security of the Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a joint news conference that EU countries would debate what measures to take \"and then act.\"\nU.K., German leaders on Moscow's alleged involvement in nerve agent attack 1:43\nOne senior official familiar with discussions said the extent of measures in the coming weeks could be \"surprising\" and not confined to expulsions. There is no talk of more economic sanctions, whose enforcement has divided the EU in the past.\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was likely to announce the expulsion of several people on Monday, after returning to Prague and consulting with his foreign minister.\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was ready to expel Russian spies, whose activities she said were deeply harmful: \"It is certain that a co-ordinated action will be taken next week, maybe at the start of it,\" she said. \"It's absolutely obvious that the network exists and that it acts aggressively.\"\n\n#EUCO agrees with UK government that highly likely Russia is responsible for #SalisburyAttack and that there is no other plausible explanation.\n— @eucopresident Romanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that national governments wanted to retain control of the details in an area where they guard their sovereignty from Brussels. But most of those present would go home and prepare suitable steps.\nRussia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since the Second World War. A U.K. judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack.\nDiplomats expelled Moscow retaliated against May's move to expel 23 Russians by announcing the expulsion of the same number of Britons.\nOn Friday, the Russian foreign ministry described the EU accusation as \"baseless\" and accused the bloc of spurning co-operation with Moscow and joining \"another anti-Russian campaign deployed by London and its allies overseas with an obvious goal: to put another obstacle on the path to the normalization of the situation on the European continent\".\nIn Moscow, the expulsion of British diplomats went ahead, a convoy of minibuses speeding out of the embassy compound to applause after British embassy staff said their goodbyes in the courtyard under a light snowfall.\nA bus reportedly carrying British diplomats expelled by Russia leave the U.K. Embassy in Moscow on Friday. The Kremlin retaliated against May's move to expel 23 Russians by announcing the expulsion of the same number of Britons. (Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)\nA special charter flight is expected to fly the diplomats back to Britain later on Friday.\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on a visit to Kiev, signalled that Paris was considering expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. \"You will see,\" he said.\nThe summit statement hardened previous EU language on Russia's alleged role as Macron and others helped May overcome hesitation on the part of some of Moscow's friendlier states, some of whom questioned how definitive Britain's evidence is.\nStanding beside France's president and echoing his view that Russia had breached the sovereignty and security of the Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU countries would debate what measures to take 'and then act.' (Geert Vanden Wijngaert/Associated Press)\n\"What we will now consider in the coming days is whether we want to take individual action relating to Russian diplomats in Ireland,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters. \"We're not going to expel people randomly.\"\nWelcoming the solidarity she secured from the summit, May told reporters on leaving: \"The threat from Russia is one that respects no borders and I think it is clear that Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans and it is right that we stand together in defence of those values.\"\nStill, some said they could ill afford Russian retaliation against their own Moscow embassies, some of which employ barely a handful of accredited diplomats.\nAustria said it did not plan to expel Russians.\n© Thomson Reuters, 2018",

      "text": "Europe should use a reprieve with President Donald Trump in a simmering trade conflict to convince the U.S. to team up against China’s potentially “unfair” trade practices, according to a German government official.\nJuergen Hardt, who oversees transatlantic coordination for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led coalition, said the EU’s exemption from U.S. steel and aluminum levies will win “time to talk” about the risks presented by a more assertive China in global commerce.\nHardt discusses global trade tensions and the impact on the EU.\n(Source: Bloomberg) “One of our proposals to the U.S. side is that we should go into talks on how we can face probably unfair trade practices from China,” Hardt said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Berlin on Friday. “If you look at our economies -- the U.S. plus the European Union’s economy -- it’s double and therefore also our leverage is double.”\nGerman Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a close Merkel confidante who held talks this week with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, expressed relief that diplomatic overtures made an impact, defusing the risk of a tit-for-tat trade conflict. He said the German government stood by its criticism of Trump’s “unilateral” measures.\n“We confronted the question of whether there would be a trade war between the U.S. and Europe,” Altmaier told reporters in the German capital. He said he made no counter-offers to the U.S. to secure an exemption on tariffs.\nThe Trump administration opted to sidestep a trade conflict with the EU for now, while announcing levies worth $50 billion on Chinese imports. Expressing the free-trade stance of Merkel’s new government, Hardt said it was crucial to prevent a “race to the top” on tariffs -- and that a trade conflict would translate into a “lose-lose competition.”\n‘Sovereign Decision’ The EU has an opportunity to open a “new dialogue” with the U.S. on trade, even as Trump and his officials have singled out Germany’s yawning surplus as unfair to the U.S. economy and its workers. Hardt, who held talks with U.S. officials in Washington two weeks ago, said there is “strong support” among U.S. lawmakers for a multilateral trade approach.\nOn China, Hardt expressed optimism that Beijing would eventually back the global trade regime, “because they are exporters, and strong exporters are in favor of having easy trade relations and no trade wars.”\nHardt, who is also a CDU member of the lower house of parliament, questioned Germany’s responsibility for its trade deficit, saying the U.S. could invest more in infrastructure and education. German high-end goods such as luxury cars aren’t in price competition with U.S. products, he added.\n“It’s a free and sovereign decision of every customer in the U.S. to buy a BMW and Mercedes and not a Chevrolet or Cadillac,” he said.\n Birgit Jennen, and Rainer Buergin\n ",

      "text": "The German government and lawmakers in the lower house of parliament are ratcheting up the pressure on Facebook Inc. to guarantee privacy following reports that an election consulting firm siphoned data from tens of millions of the social network’s users.\nJustice and Consumer Protection Minister Katarina Barley summoned Facebook officials to a meeting on Monday in Berlin, ministry spokeswoman Josephine Steffen said at a regular news conference. The gathering will be attended by officials including Richard Allen, Facebook vice president of policy for the EMEA region.\n“We will talk to the representatives of Facebook, we will also ask if German users are affected, how this came about and what Facebook intends to do in the future so that it won’t happen again,” Steffen said.\nThe company has come under sustained criticism following reports that Cambridge Analytica used data to help build an election-consulting company and bragged it could influence votes around the world. Some 270,000 users authorized an academic to use their information for research purposes, but the researcher allegedly violated privacy rules when he handed the data off to the advertising firm, the reports said.\nBarley has said that Facebook users must know exactly what happens to their personal information before allowing it to be harvested. Fines of as much as 4 percent of global annual sales can be levied from May under a European data protection law, she added.\nUnanswered Questions Stephan Harbarth, a deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led bloc in parliament, said the government will consider legal action to force social network operators to better protect privacy.\nMerkel’s CDU will invite Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to speak to the Bundestag’s committee on the digital agenda, which deals with internet policy issues, Handelsblatt newspaper reported, citing Thomas Jarzombek, a committee member.\nFacebook officials were invited to a special meeting of the committee on Friday, but “most of the questions remain unanswered,” Jarzombek said in an emailed statement. “I would have liked more clarification.”\n ",

      "text": "Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2unZ0 WorldLink: Berlin, city of singles \nBefore Berlin was so radically and comprehensively gentrified, I lived in a fourth floor apartment of a crumbling house whose windows looked across a concrete yard into an apartment of an old man. We largely kept different hours, and he to himself. As such, our exchanges never progressed beyond the occasional stairwell greeting. \nBut late at night I would often see the light go on in his kitchen, and in he would hobble. Until one evening, he didn't. For a couple of days, I rang his bell and eventually alerted the building's managers. They came and shortly thereafter confirmed my worst fears. He had died. \nElke Schilling, a silver-haired woman in her early 70s, had a similar experience in her block of flats. When she saw no sign of life from the neighboring apartment for a couple of weeks, she called the police. They would only break in on the condition that she paid for the repairs should the missing man be on holiday. Needless to say, he wasn't. \nThe incident proved impelling. Realizing the need to tackle isolation in this city of almost 4 million, she founded Silbernetz , a telephone-based solution modeled on a British project. \nLooking for Silbernetz friends, this advert reads. A weekly telephone call can make a world of difference \nAnd for eight days over the Christmas period, she and her team offered Berlin's old and lonely something she describes as elementary: the chance to converse. Of the 300 calls, a third led to real conversations. \nMore Berlin and beyond: \n- Berlin and beyond: Sticks and the city \nThat, coupled with the estimated 300,000 Berliners over the age of 60 who suffer from some degree of loneliness — often because a spouse and friends have died, family has moved away or they've had to downsize to a completely different part of the city — underscored Elke Schilling's determination to make the Silbernetz hotline a more permanent fixture. \nThat is now the goal. \nSpreading the word is vital \nAcross town, music, prosecco and dance herald the opening of another new venture designed to prevent the onset of loneliness. A Humanist Association smorgasbord of cultural, social, linguistic and technical opportunities for the 60+ based on the idea of gemeinsam statt einsam or together rather than lonely. \nAnd to underscore the richness of togetherness, a quartet of ladies in red accompanied by a solitary man on guitar perform a snippet from one of the plays they draw on their experiences to write. Their closing line, delivered with punch and passion, is a simple declaration of love for life. \nThe Pfefferstreuer amateur dramatics group visibly embrace their stage of life \nAs they see it, it's about getting maximum enjoyment out every phase and age of life, and being brave enough to try something new. \nMore Berlin and beyond: \n- Berlin and beyond: Cold comfort city? \nFor some, that might be singing and dancing, a computer course or a group walk in the park. For others, it might simply be picking up the telephone and dialing a number they know will connect them to someone who is happy to talk. \nI have long since left the apartment building with the concrete yard, and now live in a place where everyone knows each other well enough to prevent the onset of isolation, but I often think of the old man who passed away at home alone. I'll never know, had there been the same opportunities back then that there are now, if the end of his life might have played out differently. But I do wonder. \nIn Berlin and beyond, British-born Tamsin Walker takes a closer look at some of the quirks and perks of life in Germany, which has been her home for almost 20 years.

D 97 , 055033 – Published 23 March 2018 References Abstract \nA natural possibility for dark matter is that it is composed of the stable pions of a QCD-like hidden sector. Existing literature largely assumes that pion self-interactions alone control the early universe cosmology. We point out that processes involving vector mesons typically dominate the physics of dark matter freeze-out and significantly widen the viable mass range for these models. The vector mesons also give rise to striking signals at accelerators. For example, in most of the cosmologically favored parameter space, the vector mesons are naturally long-lived and produce standard model particles in their decays. Electron and proton beam fixed-target experiments such as HPS, SeaQuest, and LDMX can exploit these signals to explore much of the viable parameter space. We also comment on dark matter decay inherent in a large class of previously considered models and explain how to ensure dark matter stability.

      "text": "Oman Observer \nBRUSSELS: European Union member states agreed at a summit in Brussels to take further punitive steps against Russia in the coming days for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it. Late on Thursday, in a boost for British Prime Minister Theresa May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack on a former Russian spy and said it was “highly likely” Moscow was responsible. They also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia. “Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,” summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters. French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris and Berlin would be among countries taking further rapid and coordinated measures which other leaders said would include the expulsion of Russian officials and possible other retaliatory actions. “We consider this attack a serious challenge to our security and European sovereignty so it calls for a coordinated and determined response from the European Union and its member states,” Macron told a news conference. Standing beside him, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU countries would debate what measures to take “and then act”. One senior official familiar with discussions said the extent of measures in the coming weeks could be “surprising” and not confined to expulsions. There is no talk of more economic sanctions, whose enforcement has divided the EU in the past. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was likely to announce the expulsion of several people on Monday, after returning to Prague and consulting with his foreign minister. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was ready to expel Russian spies, whose activities she said were deeply harmful. Russia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two. A British judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack. Moscow retaliated against May’s move to expel 23 Russians by announcing the expulsion of the same number of Britons. — Reuters Share on:",

      "title": "Europeans to take new steps against Russia over UK spy",
      "text": "European Union member states agreed at a summit in Brussels to take further punitive steps against Russia in the coming days for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it.\nLate on Thursday, in a boost for British Prime Minister Theresa May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack on a former Russian spy and said it was \"highly likely\" Moscow was responsible. They also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia.\n\"Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,\" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Paris and Berlin would be among countries taking further rapid and coordinated measures which other leaders said would include the expulsion of Russian officials and possible other retaliatory actions.\n\"We consider this attack a serious challenge to our security and European sovereignty so it calls for a coordinated and determined response from the European Union and its member states,\" Macron told a news conference.\nStanding beside him, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU countries would debate what measures to take \"and then act\".\nOne senior official familiar with discussions said the extent of measures in the coming weeks could be \"surprising\" and not confined to expulsions. There is no talk of more economic sanctions, whose enforcement has divided the EU in the past.\nshow chapters UK PM May on tariffs, Russia and Brexit      5:20 AM ET Fri, 23 March 2018 | 00:59 Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was likely to announce the expulsion of several people on Monday, after returning to Prague and consulting with his foreign minister.\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was ready to expel Russian spies, whose activities she said were deeply harmful: \"It is certain that a coordinated action will be taken next week, maybe at the start of it,\" she said.\n\"It's absolutely obvious that the network exists and that it acts aggressively.\"\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that national governments wanted to retain control of the details in an area where they guard their sovereignty from Brussels. But most of those present would go home and prepare suitable steps.\nRussia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two. A British judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack.\nBritish expelled Moscow retaliated against May's move to expel 23 Russians by announcing the expulsion of the same number of Britons.\nOn Friday, the Russian foreign ministry described the EU accusation as \"baseless\" and accused the bloc of spurning cooperation with Moscow and joining \"another anti-Russian campaign deployed by London and its allies overseas with an obvious goal: to put another obstacle on the path to the normalization of the situation on the European continent\".\nIn Moscow, the expulsion of British diplomats went ahead, a convoy of minibuses speeding out of the embassy compound to applause after British embassy staff said their goodbyes in the courtyard under a light snowfall.\nshow chapters German relations with Russia ‘complicated,’ policy expert says      3:54 AM ET Thu, 22 March 2018 | 04:04 A special charter flight is expected to fly the diplomats back to Britain later on Friday.\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on a visit to Kiev, signaled that Paris was considering expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. \"You will see,\" he said.\nThe summit statement hardened previous EU language on Russia's alleged role as French President Emmanuel Macron and others helped May overcome hesitation on the part of some of Moscow's friendlier states, some of whom questioned how definitive Britain's evidence is.\n\"What we will now consider in the coming days is whether we want to take individual action relating to Russian diplomats in Ireland,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters.\n\"We're not going to expel people randomly.\"\nWelcoming the solidarity she secured from the summit, May told reporters on leaving: \"The threat from Russia is one that respects no borders and I think it is clear that Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans and it is right that we stand together in defence of those values.\"\nStill, some said they could ill afford Russian retaliation against their own Moscow embassies, some of which employ barely a handful of accredited diplomats.\nAustria said it did not plan to expel Russians.",

      "text": "By Michael Birnbaum, Anna Fifield and Loveday Morris | Washington Post\nBRUSSELS – President Donald Trump’s decision to make John Bolton his new national security adviser ricocheted around the globe on Friday, unsettling allies and raising alarm that a hawk who advocates military action against North Korea and Iran will have the president’s ear.\nFrom Berlin and Jerusalem to Seoul and Tokyo, U.S. allies who have long felt that Trump’s unconventional rhetoric on foreign policy often did not translate to concrete policy are bracing for a shift. Following the nomination last week of the hawkish Mike Pompeo to become secretary of state, Bolton’s elevation means that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is the lone survivor among a trifecta of advisers who pushed Trump to hew closer to conventional foreign policy positions.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.\nSign up for our new Morning Report weekday newsletter .\nNow, Bolton’s regime-change rhetoric toward North Korea and Iran may lead to a hardening of policy, allies believe. Europeans, who widely support a 2015 deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear program, fear its imminent demise. Some Israelis – even those who criticized the pact – are also concerned. And in South Korea and Japan, there are fears that Trump is preparing for war if talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled for May, fail to yield breakthroughs.\nMore broadly, the appointment has fueled worries that the Trump administration is turning its back on Washington’s decades-long role as the preeminent guarantor of global stability.\n“We would desperately wish to see the United States in a constructive leading role as a steward of the international system,” said Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the lower house of the German Parliament. He said he fears Washington is moving in the opposite direction.\n“We are concerned that the policy is coming closer to the rhetoric,” he said. Trump “has now surrounded himself with people who share his intuitions and his general views.”\nSome leaders braced themselves for more turmoil.",

      "text": "Fraunhofer HHI develops distributed aggregation and reception of 400 Gb/s   Applications and Research \n“Record-breaking” superchannel in a single-photodiode 110-GHz Kramers-Kronig receiver. \nBerlin’s Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute HHI has developed a distributed superchannel aggregation scheme to demonstrate ultra-wideband single-photodiode reception based on inherently polarization-aligned Kramers-Kronig carrier generation at the receiver. \nFor optimized conditions, a record net capacity of 400 Gb/s was achieved using a distributedly aggregated superchannel of 3×33 GBd 32QAM sub-carriers. The development was premiered at the recent OFC 2018 expo in San Diego, earlier this month. \nHHI commented that the need to establish and implement high capacity, simplified and cost-effective direct-detection schemes for short reach systems, such as data center interconnect, is propelling optical communication industries to find innovative techniques to realize these goals. \nContrary to other direct-detection schemes, the single-polarization Kramers-Kronig technique allows the reception of complex modulation formats with a single photodiode by additionally using a Kramers-Kronig carrier, which needs to be polarization-aligned to the data signal. \nTo avoid receiver-based polarization control, the KK carrier is usually co-generated at the transmitter. In contrast to this already existing scheme, researchers at Fraunhofer HHI have developed a novel single-polarization Kramers-Kronig receiver scheme, which is based on the generation of an inherently polarization-aligned Kramers-Kronig carrier in the receiver. \nThe combination of a distributed superchannel aggregation based on optical bus topology and the receiver-based KK carrier generation, enables KK reception of ultra-wideband signals without using ultra-wideband transmitters. \nHow HHI achieved this The researchers distributedly aggregate a 3×33 GBd superchannel spanning more than 100 GHz with a 495 Gb/s gross rate using the bus topology concept. In the scheme, a master continuous wave is propagated through the bus and collects locally generated sub-carriers of each optical node along the bus. \nIn the receiver, a similar node is used to generate the KK carrier. As the polarizations of the superchannel and the generated KK carrier are determined by the state-of-polarization of the incoming master CW, automatic polarization alignment of the KK carrier and the data is achieved without the need for polarization tracking. \nEach sub-carrier in the superchannel was detected with error-free performance and a 400 Gb/s payload was achieved. This is the highest capacity reported so far for single-polarization single-photodiode KK reception, said HHI. \nBy applying this technology to short reach and metro-haul optical networks (such as in data center interconnects), the cost and complexity of the communications environment could be reduced.",

      "text": "March 23, 2018 at 10:42 am | UPDATED: March 23, 2018 at 10:43 am \nBy Michael Birnbaum, Anna Fifield and Loveday Morris | Washington Post \nBRUSSELS – President Donald Trump’s decision to make John Bolton his new national security adviser ricocheted around the globe on Friday, unsettling allies and raising alarm that a hawk who advocates military action against North Korea and Iran will have the president’s ear. \nFrom Berlin and Jerusalem to Seoul and Tokyo, U.S. allies who have long felt that Trump’s unconventional rhetoric on foreign policy often did not translate to concrete policy are bracing for a shift. Following the nomination last week of the hawkish Mike Pompeo to become secretary of state, Bolton’s elevation means that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is the lone survivor among a trifecta of advisers who pushed Trump to hew closer to conventional foreign policy positions. Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our new Morning Report weekday newsletter . \nNow, Bolton’s regime-change rhetoric toward North Korea and Iran may lead to a hardening of policy, allies believe. Europeans, who widely support a 2015 deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear program, fear its imminent demise. Some Israelis – even those who criticized the pact – are also concerned. And in South Korea and Japan, there are fears that Trump is preparing for war if talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, scheduled for May, fail to yield breakthroughs. \nMore broadly, the appointment has fueled worries that the Trump administration is turning its back on Washington’s decades-long role as the preeminent guarantor of global stability. \n“We would desperately wish to see the United States in a constructive leading role as a steward of the international system,” said Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the lower house of the German Parliament. He said he fears Washington is moving in the opposite direction. \n“We are concerned that the policy is coming closer to the rhetoric,” he said. Trump “has now surrounded himself with people who share his intuitions and his general views.” \nSome leaders braced themselves for more turmoil. \n“We are at the greatest risk of real conflict than we have been for many years, perhaps decades,” said Xenia Wickett, head of the Americas program at Chatham House, a London think tank. \nThe appointment enflamed concerns about the prospects of a conflict with North Korea. H.R. McMaster, the outgoing national security adviser, was no dove on Pyongyang, repeatedly talking about military options to make it give up its nuclear weapons program. But Bolton’s move into the president’s inner circle comes at a particularly sensitive time: The South Korean president is preparing to hold a summit with Kim Jong Un at the end of April, and Trump plans to follow suit in May. \n“By tapping Bolton, who has called for preemptive strikes against North Korea, Trump is sending a message to the regime, telling them that they should come out to talks in order to avoid such drastic military backlash,” said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice foreign minister who is now dean of Korea University’s Graduate School of International Studies. \nBolton has advocated a hard line against North Korea since he served as undersecretary of state for arms control and ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. \nAt that time, the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency regularly denounced Bolton, calling him “human scum and a bloodsucker.” \nThe hostility is mutual. \n“There’s an all-purpose joke here,” Bolton said this month when asked about North Korea’s conciliatory moves toward South Korea and, by extension, the United States. “Question: How do you know that the North Korean regime is lying? Answer: Their lips are moving.” \nJapan has also been increasingly worried about becoming collateral damage, as North Korea last year fired several missiles over Japanese territory and threatened to strike American military bases in Japan. \nBolton’s ascent lends even higher states to the diplomatic effort underway. \n“I am particularly worried that if the Trump-Kim summit fails, Bolton will take that as proof that we must hit North Korea,” said Robert Kelly, an American who teaches international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea. \nIn Europe, even before the Bolton move, leaders were gathered for a two-day summit in Brussels that was dominated by concerns about Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, another area that threatens the transatlantic relationship that has underpinned Western stability since the end of the Cold War. \nFor Europeans, Bolton himself is a throwback to the era of clashes with Washington at the outset of the war in Iraq in 2003. This time, though, he will have far more power than in his Bush-era role. \n“A nightmare comes true,” Reinhard Bütikofer, a German member of the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter. \nThe appointment comes days after EU and U.S. officials clashed over the future of the Iran nuclear deal, which Europeans are trying desperately to preserve ahead of a key deadline for U.S. adherence to the pact. \nThe Trump administration has said it will not sign a new sanctions waiver for Iran by May 12 unless changes are made to the agreement on grounds that Tehran has not lived up to the “spirit” of the deal. Bolton has long been a critic of the accord, which Europeans see as critical to avoiding war in their immediate neighborhood. \n“With the appointment of Mike Pompeo on the one side, and John Bolton on the other, the group of personalities who have never made any mystery of their opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran is growing,” said Pierre Vimont, a retired senior French diplomat who has been involved in past negotiations with Iran. \nThe fears were less widely shared in Israel, where many are critical of the Iran deal and where Bolton’s appointment was widely welcomed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government. Education Minister Naftali Bennett called Bolton an “extraordinary security expert, experienced diplomat and a stalwart friend of Israel.” \nBut even in Jerusalem, his return stirred some concern. \nWhile Netanyahu has lobbied for the United States to “fix or nix” the Iran nuclear deal, some Israeli security officials have warned against a complete collapse of the pact – a prospect that may be more likely with Bolton as national security adviser. They argue that a flawed agreement is better than none at all. Bolton has said that the deal was a “strategic mistake” and should be “abrogated.” \nMeanwhile, Israel is likely to be at the sharp-end of any conflict with Iran, something Bolton has repeatedly floated. \nThe Israeli security establishment is split, said Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. “There is a concern that he’s primarily an ideologue and there’s a risk to stability, and others who say he has decades of experience.” \nNor did Bolton’s ascension give hope to Palestinians already infuriated by the U.S. Embassy’s move to Jerusalem. \nThe appointment of Bolton, who has argued that the Palestinians do not have a right to self-determination, “adds insult to injury,” said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee. \n“This is unprecedented, this lethal combination of hard-liners, Israel-firsters, who are in charge of decision making in the U.S.” Tags:",

      "title": "German MSM vs. Gabriel",
      "text": "Permission Details DMCA - Advertisement - \nSigmar Gabriel is not my favorite German politician (I don't have one), but he occasionally makes some reasonable remarks. When the subject is Russia, however, the German MSM are as stubbornly impervious to common sense, not to mention journalistic integrity, as their counterparts in the US and the UK. \nOn March 15 Gabriel, having just vacated the office of Foreign Minister, gave a speech at the German-Russian Forum in Berlin. I don't know much about what he said because I wasn't there, but fortunately a Mr. Vitzthum from Die Welt was (or was he?), who describes it as a \"nasty reckoning\" with the (reelected) Merkel government. This is not so much because Gabriel suggested that sanctions were not the best way to deal with the Crimea issue, since he also said so as Foreign Minister, but because of what he said about the Skripal incident. \nSomebody working for the German edition of the Huffington Post whose German -- or intelligence, or both -- is not up to the job read the story in Die Welt and reported it as saying that Gabriel \"defended Vladimir Putin and Russia\" by saying that \"Someone is innocent until the opposite is proven.\" \nThe newsweekly Focus , in a wandering article curiously titled \"The Skripal Affair Shows Gabriel That He Has Learned Nothing from His Past,\" doesn't even mention Gabriel until the sixth paragraph (of seven), where it becomes clear that \"his past\" refers to his opposition to the sanctions -- as if that were something to be ashamed of. It also accuses him of \"defending Putin.\" For visual relief there is a photo of Gabriel and Putin smiling at each other, though Putin was not at the meeting that was the ostensible subject of the article. - Advertisement - \nSo what did Gabriel actually say in Berlin? Hard to tell from these articles, and I have not seen it covered elsewhere. The Forum promises to post a transcription but it hasn't appeared yet. \nOh, wait. There is one more \"source,\" if you want to call it that. I refer to RT Deutsch , the German counterpart of RT.com, that dastardly purveyor of False News and Russian Propaganda. They had the gall to publish not only an accurate summary but an actual video of Gabriel's remarks about the Skripal event! Reader beware. Fearing yet another Ruskie trick, I transcribed the video and translated it myself: \n\"We are currently experiencing, of course, with the attack on a man who was formerly, so I read at any rate, a double agent in the UK, one of the worst escalations we have had recently, and of course I understand every British citizen who, being told this was a chemical weapon of war developed in the Soviet Union, thinks first that if it was developed there, and if it was produced in former member states of the Soviet Union, and if it involves a Russian double agent, then there may be evidence that this weapon may have come from Russia. - Advertisement - \n\"However, I would recommend that we not allow ourselves, as Germans and Europeans, to be driven into an increasingly shrill public debate. There is in our country, which is based on the rule of law [ Rechtsstaat ], a relatively simple but effective way to settle legal questions, and that is that someone is innocent until a court has proved the contrary. This presumption of innocence should not push aside the British concerns, or push aside the scandal, which of course it is, of using a chemical weapon of war to kill a person. But this is the way to solve the problem. The way to solve the problem can only be to let the international bodies that we have investigate the case and then present the evidence. We are all members of a UN organization whose purpose is to control and destroy chemical weapons [the OPCW], and I think the wisest thing is to allow this institution to investigate, using all the evidence, and then after the investigation, not before , determine what political conclusions we should draw from it. \n\"This does not reduce the scandal of what has happened, or ignore the British concerns, but it prevents what I think is probably the worst poison in international relations, and that is this spiral of mutual suspicion and strange stories, whereby one side develops the most bizarre ideas about why one side might have done this or the other side that, and you feel like you're in the middle of a very bad James Bond film where both sides have no other goal than to pursue their own conspiracy theory. I think the only way to counter this is to actually do what we do in criminal cases, which is to allow an institution specially created for this purpose to investigate it, gather all the evidence, and then say what conclusions should be drawn. \n\"Why do I advocate such a careful and reasonable German attitude? Because we know from our own history how quickly national narratives can be used against each other. Because we know from our own history that in the end it is the civilian population that pays the price for such developments, in the worst case with their health and with their lives. And furthermore because we know that such confrontations will always end up, if it comes to that, taking place in the Federal Republic of Germany and in Europe.\" \nThis is what Die Welt calls a \"nasty reckoning\" with Merkel et al. and HuffPost and Focus call \"defending Putin.\" \nI call it common sense, uncommon enough in today's environment.",

      "text": "Joshua Leonard: Hollywood's go-to guy for daring movie-making Offbeat Joshua Leonard: Hollywood's go-to guy for daring movie-making /node/1272071/offbeat Joshua Leonard: Hollywood's go-to guy for daring movie-making AFP | Published — Friday 23 March 2018 In this file photo taken on February 21, 2018 US actor Joshua Leonard (L) and US director Steven Soderbergh (R) pose during the photo call for the film \"Unsane\" presented in competition during the 68th edition of the Berlinale film festival in Berlin. (AFP) Related Articles Hollywood star Will Smith and his son create eco-friendly water company LOS ANGELES: Ever since Joshua Leonard helped reinvent indie filmmaking as a star of found-footage pioneer \"The Blair Witch Project,\" he has been something of a go-to guy for groundbreaking, no-budget cinema. Two decades on he's at it again, in an acclaimed but deeply unsettling role as a stalker in \"Unsane\" -- filmed entirely on an iPhone by Oscar-winning auteur Steven Soderbergh (\"Erin Brockovich,\" \"Traffic\"). \"The only reason I have a career still is that we availed ourselves of new technology and unprecedented techniques 20 years ago with 'Blair Witch,'\" said Leonard, 42, enthusing about how low-fi filmmaking appeals to his impatient streak. \"I think it's the reason that I was so excited when I got called in to make this project, because I love making films much more than I love waiting to make films,\" he told AFP ahead its US release on Friday. \"Unsane\" stars British actress Claire Foy, of the Netflix series \"The Crown\", as Pennsylvania office worker Sawyer Valentini, who has left her hometown under mysterious circumstances. After an online dating encounter leaves her upset, she seeks help from a counselor at a local clinic, who tells her to sign a routine form before she leaves. Within minutes, she is committed to a mental institution against her will and pumped full of pills. A fellow patient whose background may be more interesting than he is letting on, tells her she's been locked away as part of an insurance scam but that if she keeps her head down, she will be released within days. However when Sawyer encounters Leonard's character, an orderly she claims has been stalking her for two years, the audience begins to question her sanity as well. Roundly praised Leonard's nuanced, half-pathetic, half-terrifying performance has been roundly praised since the movie premiered in Berlin's film festival in February, although the acclaim has done nothing for his family life. \"I just I felt terrible that my wife had to watch it, come home and sleep next to me. I want to try to figure out a way that my 15-month-old daughter never sees it when she's a teenager,\" he says, laughing. Understandably, much has been made of the iPhone novelty but the medium has overshadowed the message to some extent, with headlines concentrating on how the film was made, rather than what it has to say. Ostensibly a Kafkaesque satire of the medical insurance racket, \"Unsane\" is as much a part of the #MeToo moment as any red carpet protest since the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct scandal ignited. Foy's brittle, irritable Sawyer isn't believed when she complains about her stalker, those in charge of her care assuming she is delusional. The significance of a woman screaming to be heard in the face of threatening male sexuality, as various characters try to \"gaslight\" her by telling her the ordeal is all in her head, is not lost on Leonard. \"Unsane,\" he points out, was filmed before Weinstein was accused of litany of sex offenses, but he adds that \"anything that furthers the discussion is a good thing.\" Ironically, real-life unfair treatment of women has thrust Foy into the limelight recently, with the producers of \"The Crown\" admitting she was paid less for her award-winning performances than co-star Matt Smith. \"It's a conversation that is long overdue, and I think we've been operating off an old paradigm for far too long,\" Leonard told AFP. \"Bringing some of this information to light, like the pay gap disparity, is the first step in actually making real and lasting change. \" A divided career Leonard has divided his career between appearing in television that you might recognize -- \"Bates Motel,\" \"True Detective,\" \"CSI: Miami\" and the like -- and cinema you almost certainly won't. Cast as the steadfast cameraman Josh in \"The Blair Witch Project,\" Leonard balanced shooting the 16mm footage with improvising the increasingly-creepy turn of events alongside Heather Donahue and Michael Williams. Since its inauspicious release on 27 screens in 1999, the pioneering film from Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick has been hailed as a modern horror classic, despite having no special effects, monsters or gore. It made use of viral online marketing in a way no movie had attempted before and, despite its tiny $60,000 budget, managed to make $248 million worldwide. \"I laugh at how young I look -- that terrible mid-90s bachelor,\" he chuckles. The movie spawned myriad imitations -- including a couple of its own ropey sequels -- with found-footage movies such as \"Cloverfield,\" \"Rec\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" saturating the market over the following years. Rather than capitalizing on his sudden fame, Leonard stuck steadfastly to smaller independent films and working the festival circuit. \"When you only want to spend $3 on your film, call Josh Leonard,\" he jokes. Leonard says working with Soderbergh, an avid innovator who likes to play with genres and formats, felt like a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" -- but he wasn't expecting a theatrical release to come of it. \"That surprised and excited the hell out of all of us,\" Leonard said. \"Wherever it takes me, I'm excited to keep telling stories in whatever manner best suits the story.\" Related Articles",

The solar-powered technology that is built into the bench can monitor particulate matter in the surrounding air and maintain its own watering system. \nThe materials used to build the bench are easily recyclable and can be assembled within a matter of hours. The surface of the bench is graffiti-proof to prevent vandalism – and it comes with built-in Wifi for the modern city goer. \nSince its creation, CityTrees have been installed in Oslo, Amsterdam, London, Berlin and Paris. \nGrow Some Positivity: Click To Share The News With Your Friends – OR, Republish (Photo by Green City Solutions) \nWant A Morning Jolt of Good News?

      "text": "by Mark Shenton - Mar 23, 2018 \nThe Encores! series of concert performances that bring neglected Broadway shows back into the spotlight for just seven shows each is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. \nGrand Hotel may be just be best show in the series since Kander and Ebb’s Chicago in 1996. Like that show, this is perfectly suited to the front-on, stripped back, single-set intimacy of Encores! \nConceived by its original director/choreographer Tommy Tune as a tapestry of music, mood and movement, it follows a 24 hour period in the life of Europe’s most expensive hotel in Berlin, captured in elegant simplicity by designer Allen Moyer beneath three large chandeliers lit in changing chiaroscuro hues by Ken Billington. \nAnother director/choreographer Josh Rhodes (who choreographed the ENO versions of Carousel and Sweeney Todd) follows Tune’s template to provide an impressionistic portrait of this temporary community, and the tragedy that occurs when a debt-ridden baron attempts to rob a celebrated ballerina of a piece of valuable jewellery, and has his heart stolen by her instead. As this is going on, a businessman attempts to seduce his new secretary in the adjoining room, \nIt’s a plot ripe with melodrama and amplified emotions, but composer/lyricists Robert Wright, George Forrest and Maury Yeston supply surging melodies that perfectly complement it. \nAs rendered here to the sumptuous accompaniment of an onstage orchestra under the baton of regular Encores! MD Rob Berman, it is simply gorgeous. \nA cast of sublime Broadway performers give the show emotional and vocal heft. James Snyder’s Baron has an impressive tenor, and there’s a really lovely performance from Brandon Uranowitz as a dying Jewish bookkeeper, determined to get a taste of life, at last. \nThere’s also outstanding tango dancing from Junior Cervila and Guadalupe Garcia lending the show a haunting texture.",

      "text": "Only losers from Brexit despite logistics opportunities, says DP DHL CEO Frank Appel speaks at the Leaders \nIn Logistics conference in Berlin \nBrexit will hit both the UK and Europe by making business more complex, even though it could generate short-term opportunities for logistics providers, Deutsche Post DHL CEO Frank Appel said today. \n“There will be only losers in the long-run. Protectionism is bad and free trade is good,” he declared at the Leaders in Logistics Post & Parcel Europe conference in Berlin in response to questions after a keynote speech. \nAppel mentioned that DP DHL’s annual study on the connectivity of countries showed that those “who are well-connected are economically strong”. He said: “The countries who are most open are flourishing.” \nHowever, the UK’s forthcoming exit from the European Union will create complexity for business and as a result, customers might turn to Deutsche Post DHL to help them overcome these problems, he said. \n“In the short term it will create opportunities for logistics companies. We will probably make money because customers will come to us,” he commented. \nBut he emphasised: “I’m not for Brexit. In the long run it’s bad because it will have negative effects on the UK and Europe.” \nAsked about his views on e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Alibaba, Appel responded: “We see Amazon as a strong partner. We helped to grow their business and they helped us to grow. Our business will grow very nicely with them. I see them as a strong partner, not a threat.” \nIn his keynote presentation, the DP DHL CEO told an audience of some 200 postal industry managers, suppliers and other stakeholders that the German group had embarked on a digital strategy combining ‘Technology Exploitation’ to improve customer experience and ‘Business Exploration’ with new business models and ideas, including by leveraging internal demand. \nHe cited examples of innovations including the Postbot (a self-driving robot to carry parcels), Augmented Reality smart glasses and the collaborative sorting robot Sawyer in warehouses, the Saloodo freight transport online platform and DHL’s On Demand Delivery service. \nOn Saloodo, he commented: “It might cannibalise our core business in future but that’s better than being replaced. And if it doesn’t work, then others will not succeed either.” \nAppel also said that DP DHL has put about 5,500 of its self-produced Streetscooter delivery vans into operation so far, and expects its manufacturing subsidiary company to produce about 15,000 – 20,000 more this year. \nThe long-serving CEO, who is a trained scientist, urged the industry to embrace new technologies and digitalization, which were often not as complex as they sounded. “Digitalisation is not difficult. I recently programmed my first bot. It’s not that tricky. You can programme a robot.” Source : CEP-Research",

      "text": "Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:50 UTC © Telegraph.co.uk Despite being elected on an anti-interventionist program, Donald Trump has now surrounded himself with foreign policy hawks and Iraq war apologists. The new National Security Adviser, John Bolton, is just one of the wild bunch. Back in his pre-election days Trump was a vocal critic of American military adventurism. Notably in 2013, he outright said on Twitter \"All former Bush administration officials should have zero standing on Syria. Iraq was a waste of blood & treasure.\" Fast forward to 2018, and Trump is picking the likes of John Bolton - an Iraq war apologist and an advocate for starting more wars of the kind - to his team of advisers. While Bolton is known as extremely hawkish even by neocon standards, he is not the sole example in the cabinet. Both Trump's security and foreign policy teams are now full of people who backed the Iraq disaster and are now in favor of military action against Iran and North Korea. The man who pushed Berlin into the Iraq War At the time that the US was gearing up to invade Iraq, the new Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was serving in the Bush administration as Ambassador to Germany. Then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroder was opposed to the US' plans, so Coats did his job and pressured Berlin , claiming the European nation was risking isolation within the EU. The German government's skepticism was partially motivated by the experience of the 1999 Kosovo War. More recently Coats, when serving as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, vocally opposed the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. He called it \" fatally flawed \" and branded Iran \" another rogue regime \" similar to North Korea. The three Iraq War generals Trump's selection of nominees for top positions sparked quite a few jokes about how he was turning his administration over to the 1st Marine Division, which played a major role in the Iraq War. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, now head of the Pentagon, commanded the unit. His assistant John Kelly, Trump's Homeland Secretary turned Chief-of-Staff, was the first Marine Corps colonel to receive a battlefield promotion to general since the Korean War. Welcoming them into the Washington DC power circles was their fellow division officer Joseph \"Fighting Joe\" Dunford, who was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Obama and survived Trump's purges. Generals usually don't criticize decisions that resulted in them fighting wars even after retirement, although exceptions exist . Of the three on Team Trump, Mattis reportedly called the 2003 invasion \" a strategic mistake \" during a 2015 closed-door conference. In contrast, Kelly tends to reject any criticism of the military unless it comes from the military. State Secretary-to-be who equates Iran to ISIS Pompeo is leaving the office of CIA head for that of America's top diplomat, and supposedly the final resort before the guns take over the talking. When the Bush administration was preparing to take down Saddam, Pompeo was a businessman, managing investments from the Koch brothers ' network . He seems to have succeeded, considering his subsequent career as a Koch-sponsored legislator. A long-time critic of the nuclear deal, he branded Iran a \"pernicious empire\" and \"the world's largest state-sponsor of terrorism\" and outright compared it to the jihadist group Islamic State. His attempts to link Iran with ISIS, some would argue , are not unlike what the Bush administration did when they falsely accused Saddam of having ties with Al-Qaeda. Pompeo is openly hawkish on other issues too. For instance North Koreans, he said, \"are lovely people and would love to see [the nation's leader Kim Jong-un] go\" just like America would. With attitudes like these, he would probably subscribe to Zhou Enlai's paraphrase of Von Clausewitz, which said that \"all diplomacy is continuation of war by other means.\" Trump not being consistent in his position should not surprise anyone. After all, he had to learn on the job how the US military help America's global dominance. But the fact that a man nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" now seems to be the sobering voice on war-making decisions in the White House is quite chilling.

      "text": "Edward Snowden: Public Ledger Is Bitcoin’s Big Flaw Mar 22, 2018 Edward Snowden, who became notorious for exposing the U.S. National Security Agency’s (NSA) massive surveillance agenda in 2013, has said bitcoin’s central flaw may not lie in its transaction rate limitations, but in its public ledger. \nSpeaking to the audience via webcam at a Blockstack event in Berlin early March, Snowden for the first time gave the audience his detailed views on the emerging technology. While agreeing that bitcoin will endure for a long period of time, Snowden argued that he does not believe “bitcoin will last forever.” \n“Everybody is focused on the transaction rate limitations of bitcoin being its central flaw, and that is a major one,” he said, adding that, actually, “the much larger structural flaw, the long-lasting flaw, is its public ledger.” \nThe whistleblower further explained that the existing mechanism of the bitcoin blockchain has the problem of balancing recording every transaction history with attempting to scale its capacity in processing these transactions. \n“That is simply incompatible with having an enduring mechanism for trade, because you cannot have a lifelong history of everyone’s purchases, all of the interactions be available to everyone and have that work out well at scale,” he told the audience. \nTalking of his own personal preference in terms of cryptocurrencies, Snowden said: \n“When we talk about which cryptocurrencies are interesting to me, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, zcash for me is the most interesting right now, because the privacy properties of it are truly unique, but we see more and more projects that are trying to emulate this and I think this is a positive thing.” \nSnowden also aired the concern that having a public ledger that documents every transaction history, while it may appeal to a global consumer base, could also draw interest from governments that wish to outlaw the technology. \nThe comments coincide with reports yesterday of leaked documents suggesting that the NSA may be using its powerful surveillance technology to track, not just the blockchain ledger, but also individual bitcoin users of the distributed network. \nElsewhere, Snowden also raised the issue of cryptocurrency technology being used by dictators in launching state-run projects, such as the Petro token recently issued by the Venezuelan government. \nAnswering a question over whether he is worried about emerging technologies like blockchain “being co-opted by dictators, by powerful entities, corrupt entities,” Snowden said: \n“It’s not a question of if they will be, it’s a question of when they will be. It’s a question of how do we design competing systems that are simply so attractive that they will not be ignored by the global consumer base, but also the governments themselves who are seeking to compete against them will not simply be able to outlaw them and have that be meaningful.” Share this:",

      "text": "VW boss says 'risk of jail' justifies mega salary Money   8:08pm Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mueller listens during the annual earnings news conference of VW in Berlin in Berlin, Germany, March 13, 2018. Photo: Reuters \nFRANKFURT AM MAIN, Germany - The head of German car giant Volkswagen, still grappling with the fallout from a huge emissions cheating scandal, on Friday defended his 10-million-euro salary by saying it made up for the risk of having \"one foot in jail\". \nIn an interview with news weekly Der Spiegel, Matthias Mueller said he did not understand the fuss in Germany about chief executives' pay packets. \n\"It's an extremely emotional topic,\" said Mueller, who took home just over 10 million euros (R143.73 million) in 2017, up 40 percent on the previous year. \nThe salary boost came as Europe's largest carmaker roared back to profit levels not seen since before the devastating \"dieselgate\" crisis erupted in 2015 when VW admitted to installing software in millions of diesel cars designed to dupe pollution tests . \nThe scandal has so far cost the group more than 25 billion euros in buybacks, fines and compensation, and it remains mired in legal woes at home and abroad. \nMueller said a CEO's salary was determined mainly by the company's importance to the national economy as well as the responsibilities and risks shouldered by the boss. \n\"As such, one always has one foot in jail,\" Mueller told the magazine. \n\"Considering these responsibilities, our salaries are justified,\" he added. \nTwo former VW employees are serving years-long jail sentences in the United States over the \"dieselgate\" fraud, and several VW executives have faced charges from US authorities. \nAlthough diesel sales have fallen, consumers appear to have largely shrugged off the controversy, helping VW to book record sales last year and a net profit of 11.4 billion euros. \nMueller also pointed out that the 12-brand VW group -- which includes Porsche, Audi and Skoda -- recently changed its remuneration structure, and said under the old rules he would have earned as much as 14 million euros last year. \n\"So I gave up a large sum,\" he said. \nMueller was only Germany's fifth best-paid CEO last year, a study released Friday by the HKP Group consultancy found. \nThe top earner was software giant SAP's boss Bill McDermott at just over 21 million euros, followed by Dieter Zetsche of luxury carmaker Daimler who took home 13 million euros.

      "text": "EU nations plan 'additional steps' against Moscow over nerve agent attack From CBC - March 23, 2018 \nEuropean Union member states agreed at a summit in Brussels to take further punitive steps against Russia in the coming days for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, U.K., as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it. \nLate on Thursday, in a boost for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack on a former Russian spy and said it was \"highly likely\" Moscow was responsible. They also recalled the EU ambassador to Russia. \n\"Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,\" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Paris and Berlin would be among countries taking further rapid and coordinated measures which other leaders said would include the expulsion of Russian officials and possible other retaliatory actions. \nStanding beside Macron and echoing his view that Russia had breached the sovereignty and security of the Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a joint news conference that EU countries would debate what measures to take \"and then act.\" \nOne senior official familiar with discussions said the extent of measures in the coming weeks could be \"surprising\" and not confined to expulsions. There is no talk of more economic sanctions, whose enforcement has divided the EU in the past. \nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was likely to announce the expulsion of several people on Monday, after returning to Prague and consulting with his foreign minister. \nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was ready to expel Russian spies, whose activities she said were deeply harmful: \"It is certain that a co-ordinated action will be taken next week, maybe at the start of it,\" she said. \"It's absolutely obvious that the network exists and that it acts aggressively.\" \nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis stressed that national governments wanted to retain control of the details in an area where they guard their sovereignty from Brussels. But most of those present would go home and prepare suitable steps. \nRussia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since the Second World War. A U.K. judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack. Diplomats expelled",

On the initiative of Michael Geissler, Secretary General of FEDARENE and CEO of the Berlin Energy Agency, FEDARENE organised its first EU Lunch Debate on 21st March 2018 at Berlin’s Liaison office to the EU. This event took place in the framework of the first FEDARENE’s board of directors meeting of the year. Named “LunchEU”, Michael Geissler and FEDARENE hope that this first lunch debate was the first one of a long series. The goal of these meetings is to invite EU officials and politicians to discuss various themes related to sustainable energy. For this first edition, the focus was on sustainable and energy-efficient mobility in EU regions. For this occasion, the FEDARENE’s board of directors welcomed Michael Cramer , MEP and the member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and Dr Siniša Hajdaš Dončić, Vice-President of the Croatian Parliament . Both guests of honour gave a speech on clean mobility and FEDARENE board members were able to ask questions and discuss the role of local and regional authorities in the energy transition. During his introduction speech, Michael Geissler reminded that regions were essential in the fight against climate change: “We need strong political leadership in the regions to foster climate actions”.",

      "text": "Germany Selling Iran Chemical Weapons Tech, Boosting Anti-Israel Efforts as U.S. Dems Block Trump Ambassador Administration officials alarmed over bid to block Trump's ambassador to Germany U.S. officials are increasingly alarmed by a congressional block on President Donald Trump's pick to be the next ambassador to Germany, a holdup that comes as Berlin pursues a host of anti-Israel measures and is growing closer to Iran, according to multiple administration insiders who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon. Perhaps Trump could appoint Twitter to be the ambassador in the meantime. As Democrats in Congress continue to hold the nomination of Richard Grenell, a veteran Republican diplomat who was tapped by Trump to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to Germany, the post remains vacant, sparking concerns the United States is ceding leverage amid sensitive discussions regarding the future of the landmark Iran nuclear deal. Because Iran is so responsive to diplomacy. The vacancy also has left the United States with little voice to combat a series of anti-Israel efforts being pursued by the German government. Trump administration insiders are becoming increasingly fed-up with the block on Grenell, telling the Free Beacon that U.S. diplomats currently helming the post have been bungling critical national security priorities, including the Iran portfolio and recent efforts by Germany to sell Tehran sensitive equipment used by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria to produce chemical weapons. I wonder if Darth Bolton could pull double-duty . . . . \"The current leader of the embassy is not an ambassador,\" said one senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation, referring to Kent Logsdon, a former Obama administration official who is serving as the chargé d'affaires ad interim in Berlin. Just close the embassy. It would be better. \"He is perfectly nice and steeped in the State Department culture, but irrelevant to serious policy makers,\" the official said. \"He oversees a team that promotes a normalized relationship with Iran and has promoted anti-Trump speakers throughout Germany.\" He is not \"nice\". He is a backstabber. Grenell's absence on the international stage has only become more noticeable in recent months, as the Trump administration pursues a last minute diplomatic effort to strengthen the Iran deal or scrap it by May, sources said. Looks like Dems are voting to scrap it and blame Trump. The Free Beacon first reported that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was ousted from the administration due in large part to his efforts to walk back a series of demands by Trump that European allies crackdown on Iran's ballistic missile program. As negotiations continue, administration insiders have cited Germany as a prime roadblock in these discussions. German officials have declined to go along with a bid to crackdown on Tehran's ballistic missile program, which includes scores of medium-range rockets capable of striking Israel and sparking a regional war. Recent reports also indicate that Germany is likely selling Iran technology that is being used to help the Syrian regime replenish chemical weapons stocks. America is failing to exert its diplomatic muscle in Germany as Grenell's nomination languishes in Congress amid fierce opposition by Democrats. \"The Germans have become key facilitators for Iran's dual use material and technology imports,\" said one Trump administration insider who works closely with the White House on Iran issues. \"These are goods that ostensibly look civilian but can be used to help Iran advance its missile and nuclear programs.\" We can thank the present-day Fuhrer for that. Hitler burned what he could to the ground after WW II in revenge for the Germans not trying hard enough, and he had a thing for Muslims. Now Frau Merkel seems to be continuing the job. I can't imagine what good end she has in mind. \"In talks with American negotiators, Germany has made it clear it does not believe Iran's missiles should be subject to a snapback of sanctions waived by the nuclear deal,\" the source disclosed. \"Instead, the Germans say the West should simply keep waiving sanctions and offer to negotiate with Iran on its missile program by offering the regime more economic incentives in exchange for JCPOA-like concessions on missiles.\" This has caused a tense diplomatic situation that has been exacerbated by the lack of a U.S. ambassador in Germany, the source said. \"At a time like this, we need a strong-willed, pro-Israel American ambassador in Berlin,\" said the source. \"That man in Rick Grenell. The sooner he hits the ground, the sooner we start taking it to the Germans for dragging their feet on Iranian missiles.\" It's not foot-dragging. It's worse. As the Iran issue takes top billing, Germany has also come under criticism for a series of anti-Israel efforts opposed by the United States. In the latest kerfuffle, Germany has been blocking efforts by Israel to join the United Nations Security Council. Israel's presence on the council could send a significant international message and help thwart efforts by Arab nations to delegitimize the Jewish state at Turtle Bay. There, too, Grenell could have an influence, sources say, referring to his vocal support of the Jewish state and efforts to combat deligitimization efforts. Germany also has refused to take a tough line on the Iranian-tied terror group Hezbollah, according to recent report. The German government is said to be opposed to efforts by the international community to designate Hezbollah as a terror group and crackdown on its rogue activities across the region. Why should they be opposed? They are part of Frau Merkel's Final Solution. As the diplomatic battle continues, the United States has had little to no voice in the discussion, sources say, again citing Grenell's holdup. Just collateral damage to the Donks. And all those liberal Jews out there, just make sure to keep on voting like you have been. Richard Goldberg, a former senior Senate aide and current senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, described the block on Grenell as disastrous for U.S. national security and foreign policy. \"The number of bilateral issues facing the United States and Germany are mounting by the day,\" Goldberg said. \"We need a thoughtful, strong-willed, confirmed ambassador in place as soon as possible. On issues like trade, the Iran nuclear deal and Russia sanctions, the stakes are too high to drag this out any longer. Leader [Mitch] McConnell should consider filing for cloture at the end of the week if the hold isn't lifted.\" Can't Trump just appoint one?

He is a thug and a bully – but as with all bullies it only takes one person to stand up to them to see them off. \nThe Russians dismiss Britain as an insignificant little island but will soon find out to their cost that they have bitten off more than they can chew – a British bulldog is more than a match for a Russian bear. \nROBERT READMAN",

      "text": "Comments Print\nOnto her fourth term and with no electoral concerns ahead of her, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has the chance to craft EU history further, notably so if she starts forging ahead on common defence and security, writes Alessandra Pozzi Rocco.\nAlessandra Pozzi Rocco is a recent graduate from the London School of Economics and Sciences Po in Paris LSE and currently works in public policy.\nBerlin has a freshly installed government – at last. Six months of coalition negotiations reminded the 28-country bloc of how central and necessary a steady German leadership is for EU policymaking.\nAfter getting through several crises, the EU is now seeing stable economic growth and a calmer political climate. But the window of opportunity to push further economic and political integration is right before our eyes, and it is up to our leadership to seize this new momentum. Now.\nStarting off on the right foot, there is great potential for advancement in the field of security and defence policy. Fifty years of slow and clumsy developments in this area can now take a new turn, and Germany has a pivotal role to play in facilitating this process. There is a good reason to believe Berlin will take more decisive steps out of necessity, but with an even-handed approach with regards to defence, development and cooperation.\nThe stars are aligning. The unique combination of factors shows the time is ripe for concrete policy action.\nFirst, the EU’s security is threatened by a wide array of risks: its closest neighbour turns out to be a revisionist Russia annexing Crimea and leading a proxy war in Eastern Ukraine based on hybrid conflict practices.\nThe divisive Western public opinion over fake news and the use of energy supplies as a tool for influencing Ukraine at freezing winter temperatures make eastern EU members highly concerned, and the neighbourhood broadly more unstable.\nLooking South, although ISIS has almost ceased to exist, terrorism still proliferates in lawless parts of the MENA region. It is less stable than ever and poses direct threats to EU security through migration flows and terrorism.\nIn 2016, more than 65 million people were displaced, fleeing conflict around the world. Angela Merkel reacted by taking in one million refugees, but also by allowing military steps that would have been unthinkable before 2014: her government has sent, for the first time since WWII, lethal support into an active conflict zone.\nAnd this has been little remarked upon in the media, if at all. It could be considered as either deeply contradictory to Germany’s pacifist culture or as a mindset evolution amongst the establishment based on the premise that the German public needs to be protected regardless of the cost.\nSecond, Europeans always looked West for support, friendship and partnership in addressing challenges of the future. Today, Brussels hardly understands Washington, which is making relations as difficult as they are unpredictable.\nRecent evolutions in EU foreign policy – notably the awakening of PESCO sleeping beauty (Permanent Structured Cooperation, included in 2009 Lisbon Treaty) and the European Defense Fund – are a direct consequence of three interrelated factors.\nThe first is the unreliability of American rhetoric over the past year on NATO–obsolete no longer, solidarity if 2% of GDP is allocated to military spending, or unconditional solidarity to its oldest and closest allies?\nSecond, the strong concern of eastern capitals, which used to look at NATO for protection and reject further EU defence policy based on arguments of unnecessary duplication is no more. And third, the eternal veto to any European development in defence posed by London has now disappeared with Brexit (March 2019).\nNot only have barriers been lifted, but a fresh wind of change is blowing throughout the continent – a new energy brought by a younger generation in power. There come Emmanuel Macron, Charles Michel, Marc Rutte and Xavier Bettel, with a view to making EU defence and security policy a voice multiplier for Europeans on the international stage.\nAngela Merkel once again took it a step forward by stating the EU needed to take its future into its own hands. Late February 2018, Germany’s Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen shared her view at the London School of Economics for more EU in NATO through an army of Europeans in 2025, one that would be entirely integrated, inter-operable and jointly commanded and could act fast.\nTo think that she is leading the most ambitious reform of the Bundeswehr to date with these objectives in mind brings good hope that her plan will materialise and make Berlin’s military capabilities reliable for allies in out-of-area missions.\nBearing in mind that foreign policy is devised harmoniously between political leadership and expert networks in Berlin circles, all this translates into a greater German readiness to act on EU foreign policy altogether.\nOverall, most recent opinion polls (Pew Research Centre) find the German public to be more concerned by security than in the past, and more receptive to EU action in the field. However, surprising numbers show there is a stark need for better communication by the leadership: less than 30% would support a NATO intervention in helping an ally under attack.\nGermany’s approach will be a tailored one, reflecting both its culture and continued pressure from allies for more responsibility in the field. Berlin is working to lead from the middle, foster cooperation, boost EU capacities, facilitate consensus and act as framework nation for military operations.\nIt also walks a fine line on the perception by eastern patterns, who fear a dominant Germany would bring back dark memories. In all, it pursues the objective of making 27 voices fall into one that is heard and listened to on the international stage whilst not creating any competition to NATO.\nAt last, it is now also a matter of legacy for Angela Merkel. Onto her fourth term, she is in a weaker political position but definitely still enjoys the trust and goodwill from key partners. As she now does not need to put electoral concerns at the top of her list, it is a great time for her to build European history further.\nDetractors would, rightfully, ask how much of this is realistic if Germany still does not increase its military spending to meet the 2% GDP NATO target.\nBut sometimes spending more to get faster results isn’t the key to success. Having structural blocks lifted and providing wider leeway to policymaking is a much more powerful change and one that does not happen that often.",

      "text": "MOSCOW (AP) — Brazil cruised to a 3-0 friendly win at World Cup host Russia on Friday without the injured Neymar.\nIn freezing temperatures at Moscow's vast Luzhniki arena, the Brazilians worked hard to break down Russia's deep defense before three goals in 13 minutes early in the second half.\nRussian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev parried Thiago Silva's 53rd-minute shot into the path of Miranda, who scored from close range.\nPhilippe Coutinho made it 2-0 from the penalty spot nine minutes later, and Paulinho added Brazil's third in the 66th with a header off Willian's cross.\n\"I think the team is completely ready for the World Cup,\" said Brazil coach Tite, whose team faces reigning World Cup champion Germany in another friendly in Berlin on Tuesday.\nBrazil's Miranda, center, celebrates with Gabriel Jesus and Casemiro, left, after scoring the opening goal during an international friendly soccer match between Russia and Brazil at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow, Russia, Friday, March 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) \"We had our chances and we scored our goals,\" he said through a translator. \"The team achieved the goal I had set for them and that means the team understood what I would like to see from them.\"\nBrazil is now unbeaten in eight games since a 1-0 loss to Argentina in September, while the Russians haven't won any of their last four.\nTuesday's game against the Germans is the first time those teams will meet since Germany demolished Brazil 7-1 in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup.\n\"We can't change the past, we can't change history,\" Tite said. \"So what can we do against Germany? We've just got to play football. We've got to be strong tactically, we've got to be strong technically.\"\nBrazil's Philippe Coutinho, 2nd right, celebrates after scoring his side's second goal during an international friendly soccer match between Russia and Brazil at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow, Russia, Friday, March 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) Less than three months before the World Cup opens at Luzhniki, the defeat highlighted Russia's vulnerability at the back. Severe injuries to two central defenders this year forced coach Stanislav Cherchesov to field a makeshift five-man back line which was often able to do little more than stay deep and defend in numbers.\nThe three central defenders had never played together before, so \"we are starting from zero once again,\" Cherchesov said.\nOn a pitch which seemed worn after hosting a giant election rally for President Vladimir Putin earlier this month, Brazil's margin of victory would have been greater if not for some soft shooting by Brazil in the first half and good saves from Akinfeev in the second.\nThe Russian keeper showed quick reactions to keep out shots from Paulinho and Coutinho and stopped what might have been an own goal from Alexander Samedov.\nBrazil's Paulinho, center, celebrates after scoring his side's 3rd goal during an international friendly soccer match between Russia and Brazil at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow, Russia, Friday, March 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin) Up front, the Russians missed the injured Alexander Kokorin — who is unlikely to return for the World Cup — but still managed to create chances against a sometimes-shaky Brazilian defense.\nAn excellent chance went to waste late on when Anton Miranchuk hit the bar before his fellow substitute Anton Zabolotny missed an open goal on the rebound.\nAlexander Samedov and Miranchuk's brother, Alexei, both failed to score from good positions in the first half.\nOverall, Russia was simply outclassed, Cherchesov said.\n\"There's fault and there's misfortune, and this is a case when it's misfortune, because it's difficult to leap from a certain level up and over several steps,\" he said. \"If you look at the technical side, that team is a bit above us.\"\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "text": "A Taste of the World's Best Food Museums \nFacebook Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum\nWhether you prefer to go by air, sea or land, most travelers appreciate eating their way around the world. For those who have a literal hunger for travel, here is a smorgasbord of food museums not to be missed. \n  \nShin-Yokohama Raumen Museum , Yokohama, Japan \n\nThe museum's first floor is dedicated to the history of the popular noodle dish. The basement floors feature a beautiful, detailed replica of Tokyo's old town, Shitamachi (above) and a recreation of the first ramen dish ever eaten back in the 17th century. The lower floor also houses nine different restaurants that serve ramen bowls from different regions of Japan. Meanwhile, you can also create your own brand of ramen at the 'My Ramen' booth in the museum's shop. \nDeutsches Currywurst Museum , Berlin, Germany \nThe quirky museum offers a tour through the fascinating history of the fried sausage dish. You can listen to the story of its origin on a sausage-shaped telephone while sitting on a sausage-shaped couch. What's more, you can play currywurst-themed video games, prepare a virtual sausage using interactive exhibits, take some selfies behind a mock-currywurst bar, and of course, scarf down a few spicy samples. \n\nFrietmuseum Bruges Frietmuseum Bruges\nFrietmuseum , Bruges, Belgium \nLocated in northwest Belgium, this is the world's only museum dedicated to French fries, above. The first floor is dedicated to the history of French fries and how they came to Belgium. (According to historians, the Belgians have been eating fried potatoes since the late 17 th  century.) Once the tour is over, you can head over to the medieval cellars located on the basement floor to savor some free samples. \nPizza Brain , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \nCurated by pizza aficionado Brian Dwyer, this quirky museum houses the world's largest collection of pizza paraphernalia. And if browsing through all those pizza-themed books, vinyl records and action figures makes you a little peckish, you can head over to the attached pizzeria to down a few slices. \n\nNational Mustard Museum Wisconsin National Mustard Museum Wisconsin\nNational Mustard Museum ,  Middleton, Wisconsin \nComplete with assorted mustard memorabilia, interactive food quizzes and a tasting bar, this museum, above, is a mustard lover’s paradise. The star attraction is the Great Wall of Mustard—an extensive collection of over 5,600 types of prepared mustard from all 50 U.S. states and more than 70 countries. \nLe Musée du Chocolat,  Paris, France \nIf you're a chocolate addict, then  this Parisian museum  definitely needs to be on your bucket list. Also known as Choco Story, the museum has more than 1,000 exhibits that cover everything from the origin of cocoa beans to commercialization of chocolate-making. Moreover, you can also taste delicious treats made by expert chocolatiers or create one yourself at one of the workshops.\nMeet a 33-Year-Old Who Left a Six-Figure Job to Start a Travel Company \n\nJessica Nabongo Although her life sometimes looks like a vacation, it took a lot of time and effort for the solo female traveler to set her life up where she could build her business while exploring new countries like Colombia.\nLast year, Jessica Nabongo traveled to 53 countries—38 of which were new to her—and flew nearly 190,000 miles on 131 flights. And she has no plans of slowing down in 2018. But for an entrepreneur with wanderlust, this is all part of the digital nomad life she’s been building for herself since her early twenties. \n  \nAt 23, Nabongo had been working as a pharmaceutical representative for Pfizer in Detroit, and realized she wanted to do more with her life. So she left her corporate job and moved to Japan to teach English. Along the way she fell in love with expat life and vowed to live abroad for at least three more years after her time in Japan. She ended up living outside of the United States for seven years, bouncing from Asia to Europe and back again. \n\nJessica Nabongo A moment of calm for the digital nomad in Bali, Indonesia.\nAfter missing too many birthdays, weddings and funerals, Nabongo moved back to America when she turned 30, but she still had the travel bug. \nWhile helping a friend organize his honeymoon, she came up with the idea of  Jet Black , a boutique travel agency that encourages tourism to countries in Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean. “My focus is to make sure that people are really interacting with the locals,\" says Nabongo. Today, around 60 percent of the business is group trips, such as a recently organized getaway to Colombia or a future trip to Senegal. The rest is planning private trips for clients, whether it be a honeymoon or milestone birthday. \nIn its second year of business, the agency now boasts over 100 clients. The business accounts for 85 percent of her income, which she supplements with UN consultancy contracts, sponsorships as an  Instagram influencer  and freelance travel writing gigs. \n\nJessica Nabongo A moment of calm for the digital nomad in Bali, Indonesia.\nNot that her life is all a vacation. Managing a business while on the road is difficult, especially since she is usually not in the same time zone as her clients. She prioritizes waking up early in order to stay-up-to-date with requests. “I always tell people Instagram is a sliver of my life, about 20%,” Nabongo says. \n  \n“People want to be the quote-unquote digital nomad,” she continues. “You put your laptop down on the beach and say, \"hashtag, 'today's office'….that is not the reality. Traveling and working is extremely difficult.” \nSubscribe: ForbesLife's Passport Newsletter \nYour guide to luxury travel—and life's other indulgences. \nTravel Wise You must remember this: A kiss is not just a kiss in some countries. Quite often it’s a greeting and there is etiquette in the number of kisses (two for most of France, but some regions prefer three) or style of puckering (in the Philippines, a  beso-beso  is really just an air kiss, cheek to cheek). So here’s a handy guide to the number expected in a few countries. But, remember, kissing is an art, not a science, and you will definitely have awkward moments going left when you should have leaned right. In that case, just turn the other cheek. \nOne kiss: Argentina, Chile, Colombia\nTwo kisses: Croatia, France, Italy, Spain\nThree kisses: Belgium, Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland\nThe Best WiFi Hotspots for Travelers \n\nPhotos courtesy of Skyroam and Roaming Man. Skyroam Solis (left) vs. Roaming Man (right).\nFor those who can’t bear the thought of being unplugged on vacation—and simply can’t afford to be on a business trip—portable WiFi hotspots have become a travel necessity. \n  \nThe  original Skyroam  is a great alternative to purchasing local SIM cards or local data plans when traveling abroad. The latest version,  Skyroam Solis  (above left) functions the same way with some smart upgrades. Its 4G LTE is faster than the original and can be used by up to five devices at the same time in more than 120 countries. The device also works as a power bank, charging gadgets with a USB-C connection, and lasts longer, roughly sixteen hours on one charge. \n  \nUnlike the original, which can be rented for $9.95 a day, the Solis is only available for sale. It costs $149.99 for the unit, plus $9 per day passes for 24-hour unlimited WiFi. By popular demand, Skyroam also has a subscription service offering unlimited, 30-day internet access for $99 per month. \n  \nRoaming Man , above right, functions much like Skyroam. The hotspot, which took off in Asia before hitting the American market, provides unlimited 4G service in more than 100 countries for $9.99 a day and also functions as a power bank. \n  \nThe main difference, aside from fewer countries covered and design (a bit more pocket-friendly than the Solis), is that it's only available to rent. Enter your travel dates on the website, and the device will be delivered to you with WiFi access preloaded for the days of your trip. When you're finished using it, ship it back in the prepaid envelope provided. The upside: You're not buying a pricey hotspot. The downside: If you use the hotspot frequently, you won’t be happy with the shipping fees. \n  \nWhich is right for you? If you're always traveling, purchasing Skyroam Solis and signing up for the monthly subscription makes sense. If you need a hotspot for one or two big trips a year, renting is a better option. While you can still rent the original Skyroam, go with Roaming Man for the stronger battery life and faster internet speeds, especially if you're traveling to areas in Africa, where the device currently has wider coverage.",

Die Dekra-Akademie und der Bundesverband Fuhrparkmanagement e. V. (BVF) haben ihre Zusammenarbeit im Dienste der Aus- und Weiterbildung von zertifizierten Fuhrparkmanager/-innen (Dekra) bestätigt und verbesserte Qualitätsstandards beschlossen. Das Ausbildungskonzept mit einer ausgefeilten Prüfungsordnung kam bereits in der Vergangenheit gut an und sorgte für volle Seminarräume an den Ausbildungsstandorten Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt und München. Neu hinzu kommt in diesem Jahr der Standort Dortmund. Auch Teilnehmer/innen aus Österreich und der Schweiz nutzen das Angebot.\"Grundpfeiler der erfolgreichen Ausbildung sind für die jeweiligen Fachgebiete didaktisch kompetente und praxiserfahrene Referenten und die definierten Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsregelungen\", sagt Axel Schäfer, Geschäftsführer des BVF. Neben dem bisher erreichten und von Teilnehmern und Personalchefs sehr gelobten Ausbildungsniveau, haben sich die Partner Dekra Akademie und BVF auf weitere Instrumente und Maßstäbe zur Beurteilung und Verbesserung der Ausbildungsqualität geeinigt. \"Vor allem die als anerkannter Standard etablierte Prüfungsrichtlinie gibt der Ausbildung das notwendige Fundament\", unterstreicht Martin Hildebrandt, bei der DEKRA Qualification GmbH zuständig für Produktmanagement und Sales Support. Schäfer ergänzt: \"Wir sind auf einem sehr guten Weg mit einer abgesicherten, nachvollziehbaren und regelmäßig auf dem Prüfstand stehenden Qualität. Nur gut klingende Ausbildungsgänge und Titel ohne Substanz reichen nicht aus, um in der Praxis auch tatsächlich erfolgreich zu sein\". Der Fuhrparkverband empfiehlt vor diesem Hintergrund allen, die an eine Weiterbildung im Bereich Fuhrpark- und Mobilitätsmanagement denken, die am Markt vorhandenen Angebote genau zu prüfen.

      "text": "23.03.2018 | IT, NewMedia & Software | geschrieben von Stefanie Zender¹ | Pressemitteilung löschen Rückblick auf die Controlware IT-Security Roadshow 2018: \"Security Trends - Machine Learning, UEBA und Controlware Managed Cyber Security Service Dietzenbach, 21. März 2018 - Controlware, renommierter deutscher Systemintegrator und Managed Service Provider, gab auf der diesjährigen IT-Security Roadshow Einblicke in die wichtigsten aktuellen und zukünftigen Sicherheitstrends. Über 400 Besucher nutzten die Veranstaltungen im Februar und März, um sich in Berlin, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Hanau, Stuttgart, München und Wien über die neuesten Entwicklungen in der Cyber Security zu informieren. Die Attacken der Cyber-Kriminellen sind raffinierter denn je: Oft nutzen Angreifer maßgeschneiderte, in vermeintlich harmlosen Dateien versteckte Advanced Persistent Threats, um Unternehmensnetzwerke zu infiltrieren und über Monate hinweg wertvolle Daten abzuziehen. Klassische signaturbasierte Sicherheitslösungen haben diesen gezielten Attacken wenig entgegenzusetzen. Um einen verbesserten Schutz sicherzustellen und Einbrüche rechtzeitig zu erkennen, sind IT-Abteilungen daher gut beraten, zu ihrem bestehenden Anti-Malware-System ergänzend signaturlose Technologien wie Sandboxing oder Data Breach Detection einzusetzen. Auf der Controlware IT-Security Roadshow 2018 präsentierten die Controlware Experten zusammen mit den Partnern Check Point, Exabeam, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks und Symantec innovative Lösungen zur Abwehr mehrstufiger Malware. Im Fokus standen dabei Technologien wie Machine Learning, Künstliche Intelligenz und UEBA (User & Entity Behaviour Analytics), die es Unternehmen ermöglichen, Bedrohungen anhand ihres Verhaltens und global bereitgestellter Threat-Informationen automatisiert zu identifizieren. Darüber hinaus erfuhren die Besucher, welche Optionen ihnen das Controlware Cyber Defense Center bei der inhaltlichen Unterstützung ihres Security-Betriebs bietet. Mario Emig, Head of Information Security Business Development bei Controlware, erklärt: \"Die Zahl der Angriffe mit Ransomware ist im vergangenen Jahr massiv gestiegen, und wir gehen davon aus, dass sich dieser Trend 2018 weiter verschärfen wird. Auf unserer Roadshow konnten sich die Teilnehmer davon überzeugen, dass sich erfreulicherweise auch die Security-Lösungen dynamisch weiterentwickeln und die Hersteller neue Wege beschreiten - etwa, wenn Hersteller ihre bestehenden Lösungen durch den Einsatz von Machine Learning und Künstlicher Intelligenz aufwerten oder um neue Lösungsbausteine erweitern.\"¹",

      "text": "Suburbs Elmhurst Elmhurst high school were absent in light of a separate threat that there would be a shooting Friday March 23 at the school on St. Charles Road.\nDuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin and Elmhurst Police Chief Michael Ruth said the 17-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct for the Snapchat message, allegedly sent March 22. Police were informed and took her into custody that day. \nThe girl appeared Friday before DuPage Judge Michael Wolfe, who ordered her held in custody. She also faces a charge of possession of marijuana. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Monday March 26. \nBerlin said it was the third time within the past month a student has been charged with making a threat against a DuPage County school, stressing that it is no joking matter. \n\"My office takes any threat to the well being of our students, teachers and school personnel very seriously and will fully investigate and prosecute anyone believed responsible for threatening a school,\" Berlin said in a statement. \nThe threat came in a week where security was increased at the high school after an adult told police a relative of his, who is a student, told him back in August there would be a shooting at York on March 23. \nElmhurst police spoke to the student who told them a boy approached her in a school hallway and told her the shooting would take place March 23, police said. The student who spoke to police could not identify the student who allegedly made the statement. \nAs a result of the information and in light of national events regarding school safety, police sent additional officers, uniformed and plainclothes, to York this week. \nStudent absences were considerably higher than usual Friday, the day before spring break begins. As of 3 p.m., school personnel had tallied 1,800 absences, said Kate Allt, District 205 communications coordinator. Allt said a year ago, 650 students were reported absent on the Friday before spring break. There are 2,754 students enrolled, and an average of 125 absences each day. \nA letter from superintendent David Moyer posted Thursday on the District 205 website said inthat school would be in session Friday as a normal school day, though said all students should be prepared to show their IDs when they enter the building. \nOfficials said if parents called to say their child would not be in school, it would be considered an excused absence. \n\"The district respects the parents' right to decide whether or not to send their child to school on any given day and communicated that to families,\" Moyer said in a statement. \"I personally pray for the safety of students in Elmhurst and across the country every day.\" \nTwitter @chuckwriting",

      "text": "/ Posted on 23 March, 2018 11:17 Yoga and Ayurveda products can help disperse traffic from hotspots; pictured, meditation near Virupaksha temple in Hampi \nIndia’s Ministry of Tourism is hoping to promote a new perception and better understanding of yoga and Ayurveda as a holistic way of life to attract more health-conscious, high-end travellers deeper into India. \nIn an interview with TTG Asia at the recent ITB Berlin, Alphons Kannanthanam, the minister of state for tourism, said: “There is already a strong fan base for yoga and Ayurveda, but there are misunderstandings that yoga is just a form of exercise and that Ayurveda is a spa treatment. If we are able to (correct) that misperception, we will be able to attract more health-conscious travellers to India and perhaps even more millennials, as this is a generation that greatly values a balanced way of life.” Yoga and Ayurveda products can help disperse traffic from hotspots; pictured, meditation near Virupaksha temple in Hampi \nB Venkatesh, senior general manager, inbound-sales, with Cox & Kings India, agrees, further explaining that yoga and Ayurveda on their own “can be practised anywhere in the world” but only when they are combined and recognised as a serious medical solution will they be strong magnets for health-conscious travellers. \nKannanthanam believes that yoga and Ayurveda will help drive international arrivals deeper into India, away from just the big cities, and bring much needed tourism spend to the rural communities. This is because “yoga and Ayurveda are often practised in quieter, rural districts”, he explained. \n“Furthermore, as yoga and Ayurvedic retreats are often lengthy, running for a week or more, we will be able to keep travellers longer with us and have them spend more in the community for lodging, food, sightseeing and others,” he remarked. \nThe minister pointed out that these wellness retreats “don’t come cheap”, which fulfils India’s desire to attract higher yielding travel markets. \nAccording to Biju George, director-overseas marketing, Somatheeram Ayurveda Group, a seven-night package inclusive of accommodation, treatments and full-board meals could cost from 875 euros (US$1,083) for a single standard room to 7,532 euros for a 14-night double deluxe suite. \nSomatheeram Ayurveda Group is recognised as one of India’s leading Ayurveda specialist provider, offering five resorts in Kerala and treatments that are certified by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers. \nVenkatesh noted that there are also ultra-luxury resorts in India that offer a combination of yoga and Ayurveda, such as Ananda in the Himalayas and Carnoustie Ayurveda & Wellness Resort, where treatments carry a hefty price tag of 9,000 euros and up per person for a week of stay and treatments. \n“Wellness travellers are rarely price-sensitive, as their focus is on tuning their bodies and mind, and recovering from whatever that ails them,” he said. \nWhile Cox & Kings India gets wellness demand from all over the world, Somatheeram Ayurveda Group sees Europe as its dominant market, making up 75 per cent of bookings. \nBaby Mathew, chairman and managing director of Somatheeram Ayurveda Group, hopes to do more to court travellers from Asia where he has seen stronger interest in recent times. \n“We will open our sixth resort this November, the five-star Somatheeram Amruth in Kerala. With more room inventory and treatment facilities, we will be better able to attract even more people,” Mathew said. TAGS",

      "text": "The most outrageous pizza-related Guinness World Records EatSipTrip 18 hrs ago Jelisa Castrodale © Getty Getty Even if you've never seen one minute of either the animated or the live-action versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you know that those four amphibious crime-fighters are crazy about pizza. In the weirdly successful 2014 remake, their rat sensei Master Splinter tempted them with the world's most unbelievable pizza. \"Cheesemongers have speculated of its existence for centuries,\" he hissed . \"DaVinci's original masterpiece! I submit to you…the 99-Cheese Pizza!\"\nAlthough Donatello called that pie \"a culinary impossibility,\" nope, Australian pizzamaker Johnny di Francesco brought it to life in his Melbourne restaurant. And, in a development that would knock the Ninja Turtles' shells sideways, an even cheesier pizza was just baked in Berlin, Germany.\nThe Pizza Cent oundici Formaggi , as its creators named it, set an official Guinness World Record for the Greatest Variety of Cheese on a Pizza. Its mountain of cheese weighed in at 288.6 grams (10.2 ounces), and each kind of cheese was carefully added in 2.6 gram portions, because the crust was only slightly larger than a standard pizza with, like, three cheeses.\nWe broke a Guinness world record. Thank you so much to everyone for coming out yesterday, bringing your great vibes, and making this undertaking worthwhile! Thanks KaDeWe Guinness World Records, pizza.de and our awesome pizzaioli Mirko and Andrea for the joint effort.\nA post shared by Vadoli (@vadoli_pizza) on Mar 16, 2018 at 4:10am PDT\nThe pizza was baked at a special event held by the Vadoli Italian restaurant, pizza delivery service Pizza.de, and an entertainment company. According to Guinness, the carefully curated cheese selection included \"a mixture of classic and speciality cheeses,\" including Emmental, Comté and Leicestershire Red. (\"Each piece tastes different!\" one Centoundici Formaggi-eater told the record-keepers).\nPizza seems to be a popular vehicle for would-be Guinness World Record holders (and record breakers); the company has a long list of pizza-themed achievements on its website - although after we've topped the 100-cheese barrier, what else can possibly be accomplished? Because they'll probably just shut the Pizza Department down after this, here are four other noteworthy records:\nWorld's longest pizza © File Photo File Photo Last June, a group of 55 pizza pros and more than 150 volunteers joined forces at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California to build this record-setting pizza that stretched more than 6,333 feet in length and involved 17,700 pounds of dough, 5,000 pounds of tomato sauce and 3,900 pounds of mozzarella cheese. According to LA Weekly , it was ultimately sliced into 63,000 servings, most of which were donated to local homeless shelters.\nWorld's largest pizza © File Photo File Photo An otherwise uneventful Thursday became Italy's proudest moment since it won the 2006 World Cup, because on that December day, it reclaimed the record for the world's largest pizza (or it would have been Italy's proudest day if it weren't for the country's apparent aversion to 'healthy' pizza ). The gluten-free crust had a total surface area of 1261.65 square meters and was topped with 19,800 pounds of mozzarella. (It was also so ginormous that it had to be baked in 5,234 separate batches over the course of two days). \"'We named the pizza Ottavia to symbolize the hope of a great economic and cultural revival,\" head chef Dovilio Nardi said . \"We wanted it to be a symbol of good luck for the recovery of all countries, using the iconic pizza.\"\nWorld's highest pizza toss In addition to being the biggest mall in America, Minnesota's Mall of America has been the site of several Guinness World Records. For some reason, people went there to set records for the most number of people playing in the same handbell choir (664), the most people tying their shoes at the same time (252) and the most Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in one place (836 - and, hey, isn't this where we came in?). On April 20, 2006, Joe Carlucci set a world record for the highest pizza toss , launching a 20-ounce slab of dough 21 feet and 5 inches into the air.\nWorld's largest collection of pizza boxes\nNew Yorker Scott Wiener has literally written the book (or at least a book) on pizza boxes and, as of last March, he had amassed a collection of almost 1,000 pizza boxes from 55 different countries. He's nearly doubled the 595 boxes that he had in October 2013 when he set a world record for having the biggest collection of empty pie boxes . When he's not alphabetizing them - or whatever one does with pizza boxes - he runs Scott's Pizza Tours , a group that gives, um, pizza tours of New York City.\nYeesh, where's Master Splinter when you need him? I'm freaking starving right now.\nRelated gallery: The Illinois pizza you have yet to try\nThe Illinois pizza you have yet to try",

      "text": "WVNCC to host Holocaust survivor, Judah Samet \n  \nWest Virginia Northern Community College (WVNCC) will host Holocaust survivor, Judah Samet, on Wednesday, April 4, 2018, at 11 a.m. at Weirton Madonna High School. The event is free and open to the public. \nSamet, 79, will share his courageous story of living in the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp for 10 months when he was only seven years old. An estimated 50,000 people, including Anne Frank and her sister, Margot, perished there. Samet’s family of six were rounded up and moved from Debrecen by the German Gestapo agents, and sent to Bergen-Belsen in Northern Germany in 1944. When the Samets arrived they found 7,300 people being held in the concentration camp. The number swelled to over 60,000 just one year later. The family made the daring decision to board a train with 2,500 other prisoners to an unknown destination after being in the camp for 10 months. Fortunately, the Samets arrived in Berlin where they were rescued by Americans. About a week after being rescued, Samets father died of typhoid and the family eventually were put on a boat bound for Israel. Judah lived in Israel from 1946-1961. While there, he graduated from high school, worked as a teacher, served in the Israel Defense Forces and managed two towns for the Israeli government. Samet has lived in Toronto and New York before moving to Pittsburgh and attending Duquesne University, eventually owning his father’s jewelry store in downtown Pittsburgh. \nThe event is sponsored by West Virginia Northern Community College. Anyone interested in attending must RSVP to Sara Wood by March 28 at 304-214-8917 or by emailing her at . \nWest Virginia Northern Community College is a two-year comprehensive community college offering transfer degrees and programs in the Liberal Arts, Career-Technical and Community and Continuing Education on three campuses in the northern panhandle.

      "text": "Did Hitler model his Holocaust on the Armenian Genocide? The Ottoman Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha gave the detention order on 24 April 1915 \nAyse Temmuz , History must be a science and independent of politics The Holocaust and 1915 Armenian events are two different things and it dilutes the facts and confuses people to mix them together. Let me put it that way, if Hitler indeed had taken the Ottoman-Armenian events as a model, he would leave all Jews in Berlin comfortably in peace. 1915 events broke out because armed Armenian groups in north-east were fighting for independence, and the Ottomans, afraid they cannot cope with them, as they were backed by Russia, looked for the solution in deporting them, along with the rest of Armenian civilians living in that region, ie around northeast border with Russia, to south. The purpose was to keep that land and prevent a disintegration of Ottoman Empire (or whatever left of it). I am not trying to show it as a casual thing, the results were tragic, but this is the full picture. Armenians in the west (including the capital, Constantinople) and the Arabic states of Ottoman empire were not deported or murdered. As an example, the population of Armenians in Istanbul at that time was 164,000, in Izmit 62,000.. Some of the most Armenian populated cities were in west. You can find my source and other details here: How many Armenians were living in the Ottoman Empire? Because you compared the Armenian events with the holocaust.. As a simple person, one thing I know about the holocaust is that the nazis hunted down one by one every jewish citizen in the countries they invaded, from Greece to Scandinavian countries, directly or indirectly (thru collaboration with local governments) and sent them to camps with the ultimate goal, to exterminate the jewish race. If the Ottomans wished to wipe out the all Armenian race, like Hitler did for Jews, they would probably start from those in front of their noses. But none in west were touched. (Armenians in west, especially in the capital, were the wealthiest of their people.) This is, as I said earlier, like Nazis forgot or ignored about the Jews in Berlin or Munich.. If you are skeptical, here are some other references: -2000 were deported or arrested from Constantinople according to some sources Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915 The two events, thus, historically are very different, and no need to merge them forcefully to short-cut to a conclusion. The Turkish and Armenian people should be the sides who better most sensitive about details as it is our history. Understanding them can help us shape the future in a better way. Bunu paylaş:",

      "text": "Aronian blunders and allows a winning combination for Kramnik. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. Aronian Hangs Mate Against Kramnik In FIDE Candidates' Tournament Round 10 108 | Chess Event Coverage \nAfter a great game by both players, Levon Aronian blundered a beautiful final move by Vladimir Kramnik today at the 2018 FIDE Candidates' Tournament in Berlin. Tournament leader Fabiano Caruana held Shakhriyar Mamedyarov to a draw. \"As you saw from the opening I was a bit tired of sharp games and I wanted to play a normal, safe, equal position. It seems that whatever I do lately, it starts to get crazy,\" said Vladimir Kramnik. \"I don’t know why, how… It’s difficult to image out of this opening to get this mess on the board but I still managed. I guess I shouldn’t even try probably.\" Kramnik today tried to explain how it is possible that a player like he, who is still known as someone with a positional style, plays one crazy game after another after another at this Candidates' tournament: it's sort of happening to him. Chess.com later asked him to elaborate, and in this interview (to be posted here later), the 14th world champion pointed out that his recent tournaments have been a bit like this, with more decisive games than draws. \nKramnik also commented on not attending the press conference after his previous game, which he lost to Karjakin. \"I came, I was waiting, and then Levon and Shakhriyar were just starting the press conference. I think organisers should do it in such [a] way that [the] players shouldn't wait to give their press conference for, like, half an hour. It's clear, you know, it was a tough game, I am tired, I am hungry, by the way. And then, first of all, I have to stand here, not to sit but to stand, for half an hour to wait for the press conference and then maybe another half an hour for my press conference... I just don't find it right, you know. You should either have a alternative to have to press conference at the same time or a least maybe bring me somewhere, in a quiet place, with a little bit of sandwiches, coffee, so that I can rest. But staying here with everyone and just one your feet for half an hour...\" \nKramnik pointed out that contractually he wasn't doing anything wrong, saying he checked the contract on this. \"It's written that 'immediately after the game the player should make himself available for a press conference, and I did. It is not said that I have to wait for half an hour.\" Asked about how he is looking forward to tomorrow's clash with Kramnik, Fabiano Caruana gave an interesting description of the man who once dethroned Garry Kasparov : \"What can you expect these days? Vlad is probably the most interesting player now at the top. He sometimes approaches positions in ways that I can’t even begin to comprehend. Like, I remember his game against Wesley from Wijk aan Zee. It looked like the most quiet position ever and he sacked a piece. For nothing, from a quiet Catalan. I had never seen an idea like this. So…he’s a great world champion, former world champion, but also one of the most unusual players these days; his talent has changed so much over the years. It will be an interesting game.\" But back to today's round, in which Kramnik beat Levon Aronian in a very nice game that was somewhat spoiled by a huge blunder at the end. Kramnik's winning combination wasn't too difficult, but still pretty. Aronian, who had more personal friends than ever supporting him today in the playing hall, was visibly annoyed by some of Kramnik's evaluations of the positions during the press conference. Aronian at the press conference. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. It seemed that the Armenian GM wanted to emphasize that he was the one who made the game interesting, since he made the choice to go for a sharp position instead of equalizing with ...Be6. \"I thought, in the position, it’s interesting to try and get some chances,\" Aronian said. He felt he was the one playing for a win at the moment he blundered. After the press conference Kramnik took the time for interviews and lots of autographs. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. The top clash, between runner-up Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Fabiano Caruana , was pretty exciting as well. The Azerbaijani had the opportunity to take over the lead from his opponent, and clearly came to the board to fight. \"When you see today’s game, you see my mood before the game. I wanted to play! It was a nice try, and he defended well,\" said Mamedyarov. Mamedyarov was ready for battle. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. In a sideline of the Catalan, things got sharp for a moment but then the queens went off and Black was a pawn down. However, the compensation was clear, as Caruana pointed out: \"It's p robably the worst pawn structure I’ve ever seen for White.\" Soon after, White gave up an exchange but won a second pawn. It was Mamedyarov who was playing for a win, but Caruana didn't make mistakes. He was quite down-to-earth about not winning against Ding: \"Winning that game doesn’t improve my tournament situation so much. I mean, even if I win, I still have to overcome some very difficult games.\" A tough fight between the best-performing players so far. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. \nThe other two games were rather quiet, much quieter than the average game here in Berlin. (What a treat this tournament has been so far!) Ding Liren vs Wesley So had a fairly interesting opening phase. The American player had prepared 6...b6 in the Queen's Gambit Declined with Bf4 but got \"confused\" when his opponent didn't immediately take the gambit pawn on c7. His decision to take on f3 and play ...e5 worked out well. A good draw for So, and the 10th one for his opponent | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. Alexander Grischuk faced an ultra-solid Sergey Karjakin today, who won the opening battle with his 10th and 11th move. Afterward, Grischuk admitted that he didn't see any way to get an advantage with White from there. \"It’s very hard to beat Sergey, even in this tournament when he is not in his top form. With Black he made all draws and actually when he’s White I’m the only person who made a draw with him.\" Grischuk got nothing out of the opening today. | Photo: Maria Emelianova/Chess.com. 2018 FIDE Candidates' Tournament | Round 10 Standings Fed",

      "text": "Russia head coach Stanislav Cherchesov gestures during an international friendly soccer match between Russia and Brazil at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow, Russia, Friday, March 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n COMMENT EMAIL MORE MOSCOW (AP) — Brazil cruised to a 3-0 friendly win at World Cup host Russia on Friday without the injured Neymar.\nIn freezing temperatures at Moscow's vast Luzhniki arena, the Brazilians worked hard to break down Russia's deep defense before three goals in 13 minutes early in the second half.\nRussian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev parried Thiago Silva's 53rd-minute shot into the path of Miranda, who scored from close range.\nPhilippe Coutinho made it 2-0 from the penalty spot nine minutes later, and Paulinho added Brazil's third in the 66th with a header off Willian's cross.\n\"I think the team is completely ready for the World Cup,\" said Brazil coach Tite, whose team faces reigning World Cup champion Germany in another friendly in Berlin on Tuesday.\n\"We had our chances and we scored our goals,\" he said through a translator. \"The team achieved the goal I had set for them and that means the team understood what I would like to see from them.\"\nBrazil is now unbeaten in eight games since a 1-0 loss to Argentina in September, while the Russians haven't won any of their last four.\nTuesday's game against the Germans is the first time those teams will meet since Germany demolished Brazil 7-1 in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup.\n\"We can't change the past, we can't change history,\" Tite said. \"So what can we do against Germany? We've just got to play football. We've got to be strong tactically, we've got to be strong technically.\"\nLess than three months before the World Cup opens at Luzhniki, the defeat highlighted Russia's vulnerability at the back. Severe injuries to two central defenders this year forced coach Stanislav Cherchesov to field a makeshift five-man back line which was often able to do little more than stay deep and defend in numbers.\nThe three central defenders had never played together before, so \"we are starting from zero once again,\" Cherchesov said.\nOn a pitch which seemed worn after hosting a giant election rally for President Vladimir Putin earlier this month, Brazil's margin of victory would have been greater if not for some soft shooting by Brazil in the first half and good saves from Akinfeev in the second.\nThe Russian keeper showed quick reactions to keep out shots from Paulinho and Coutinho and stopped what might have been an own goal from Alexander Samedov.\nUp front, the Russians missed the injured Alexander Kokorin — who is unlikely to return for the World Cup — but still managed to create chances against a sometimes-shaky Brazilian defense.\nAn excellent chance went to waste late on when Anton Miranchuk hit the bar before his fellow substitute Anton Zabolotny missed an open goal on the rebound.\nAlexander Samedov and Miranchuk's brother, Alexei, both failed to score from good positions in the first half.\nOverall, Russia was simply outclassed, Cherchesov said.\n\"There's fault and there's misfortune, and this is a case when it's misfortune, because it's difficult to leap from a certain level up and over several steps,\" he said. \"If you look at the technical side, that team is a bit above us.\"",

      "text": "March 23, 2018 FIPP Content , Digital Publishing , Top Stories Comments Off on How Axel Springer came back from the dead: it disrupted itself \nAround the turn of the Millennium, Axel Springer – Germany’s largest media group – did not have a digital publishing strategy. From Europe’s most successful publishing business with record sales and record profits, Axel Springer witnessed a “ horrible loss ” of €200 million in 2001. At the time the Financial Times reported: ‘Europe’s largest press conglomerate is a mere internet midget.’ \nSpeaking in front of hundreds of media executives during the second day of the Digital Innovators’ Summit in Berlin, Dr. Andreas Wiele, President Classifieds and Marketing Media, said the digitalisation of publishing truly brought about “ a near death experience ” for the company. \nOvernight the publisher needed to come up with a radical strategy to survive. “ If you are convinced that your business will go down because there is simply a better offering and technological breakthrough, then there is only one way forward: you have to cannibalise yourself, disrupt yourself, and trust yourself. This needs to happen at full speed and determination because the opposition do not own a legacy business and do not mind attacking your business .” \nIn this process legacy publishers need to ask themselves what sets them apart from the rest and what you can do better than those starting out in your space of business, said Wiele. In Axel Springer’s case they realised that their publications essentially combined three individual businesses: selling journalistic content to consumers, selling classified advertising and marketing. The only thing that bound these three businesses together was the physical paper itself. \n“ But the internet ripped these components apart ,” said Wiele. “ It is much better to search for a new job or house or car on specialised websites. And the same is true for marketing where it is much more efficient to focus on the interaction between brands and consumers than to just put display advertising up somewhere .” \nAxel Springer decided to continue with these three businesses components but in the way it would be functional on the internet – separate from each other. \nJournalistic content was put behind a paywall in a freemium model at their largest newspaper title Bild. “ People do pay for content if they believe that it is worthwhile.” The newspaper has now grown its digital subscriber base to almost 350,000, which contributes a “ significant amount ” to the revenue.” \nIt is important that content remains independent and unique, warned Wielie. “ That is the only way to set you apart from the big distribution monopolies like Facebook and Google. If you have content that readers wants to consume, you will have a strong position in the digital sphere .” \nTo ensure alternative and independent distribution of journalistic content, Axel Springer has partnered with Samsung who holds more than 40 per cent market share in Europe to roll out the Axel Springer ‘Upday’ news app on their smartphones. It offers customised content curated by the user as well as “ must read ” selections curated by journalists and editors. Upday is now the most popular news app in Germany, the second most popular in France and third largest in the UK. \nIn a further commitment to quality content, Axel Springer acquired Business Insider “ for a significant amount of money ”. The website is fast becoming “ the true leading business and financial information site for the new generation. We have 120 million unique users and monetisation is growing very successfully ,” said Wiele. \nIn the case of classified advertising – primarily focussed on jobs, cars and real estate – the internet proved to be very efficient and profitable “ if you manage to capture the largest market share ”. Axel Springer is now the world’s largest classifieds operator through internationalising their classifieds offering across geographical boundaries. \nReferencing the growth of platforms, Wiele also warned that in the case of marketing, publishers need to ensure that they manage advertising sales by themselves, or at the very least, in partnership with other publishers. To leave this in the hands of “ any of the big platforms ” would be a mistake “ you will not survive in the long run ”. \nThe ultimate outcome of Axel Springer’s digital regeneration strategy, said Wiele, is that the company managed to grow its digital revenue in the past ten years from €200 million in 2007 to €2.5 billion in 2017. While in 2006 digital income only accounted for 1 per cent of Axel Springer’s income it has now grown to over 80 per cent. \nReproduced with kind permission of FIPP, the network for global media",

      "text": "Berlin - The international community is doing a disservice to the Egyptian people by supporting the country's armed forces with \"few strings attached,\" an anti-corruption watchdog said on Friday.\nThe new report comes just days ahead of Egypt's presidential election, in which general-turned-President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is virtually certain to win as he faces only one other opponent, an obscure politician.\nTransparency International Defence and Security says Egypt's military received financial aid and security assistance from Western states and arms companies, helping the military to consolidate its power.\nThe Berlin-based watchdog said the Egyptian military, the budget of which is largely unknown, has expanded its political power and economic ambitions and is \"a largely opaque and unaccountable institution.\"\n\"Egypt's armed forces have under President al-Sisi expanded their privileged position in the country's economy, have grabbed full control over the political system and yet they are not under any meaningful scrutiny,\" said James Lynch, the group's deputy director.\nThe report estimates Egypt's military annual budget to be $4.4bn. Over the years, the Egyptian military has built a vast economic empire that includes food, mineral water and land reclamation companies. Independent researchers say the armed forces control up to 40% of Egypt's economy, though the figures have not been officially confirmed.\nIn an interview earlier this week, al-Sisi slammed such estimates, saying the armed forces only control between 2% and 3% of the country's economy.\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent by subscribing to our FREE newsletter, Hello Africa.\nFOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook .\nAl-Sisi rose to power after he led the military overthrow of an elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, whose one-year rule proved divisive.\nEgypt was among the five largest weapon importers in the world in 2017, data from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute showed earlier this month. Egypt continues to receive $1.3bn in military aid annually from the United States.\n\"Western states, who could do much to influence this situation, are meanwhile failing to demand serious reform and instead carrying on with business as usual, while mistakenly still considering Egypt a trusted partner for security and stability in the region,\" Lynch said.\nThe report also urged the international community to promote domestic oversight of the Egyptian armed forces and make assistance available after the \"basic levels of transparency and accountability\" are met.",

      "text": "Worcester County Public Schools Beef up School Security Posted: Mar 23, 2018 1:39 PM Updated: Connect \nBERLIN , Md. - Twenty-six young children and staff members killed at Sandy Hook Elementary back in 2012. And just last month, 17 more dead after a shooting in a Parkland, Florida high school. \nAnd most recently, an armed student opening fire at a high school in Saint Mary's County in Maryland. \nFor students like Michael Mareno, they're all images that are impossible to forget. \n\"We are scared, and that's the thing. We don't want to be coming to school in fear,\" said Mareno. \nIt's the reason why Michael and about 40 other classmates at Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin met with school leaders last week to discuss ways to enhance school safety measures. \n\"It was beneficial because we started a dialogue between the two of us and we showed our concerns and they showed us theirs,\" said Mareno. \nOpening a line of communication with district officials like Assistant Superintendent and Public Schools Safety Director Steve Price. \nHe says that collaboration is necessary. \n\"One of the things we have talked about and the students brought to the table also was to ensure that there's a friendly and safe environment here that they can reach out to their peers and if there's a peer here that feels alienated or not part of the team, they can come forward and help us make sure those children are made safe,\" said Price. \nThat meeting is just one of many efforts the school district is leading to keep students safe. One of the school district's plans includes installing bollards or concrete pillars in front of Stephen Decatur High School. \n\"Across the country and across the world, one of the means of attack has been vehicles, large vehicles causing harm to civilians,\" said Price. \nOver at Pocomoke High School, leaders are discussing a program that would equip the building with 30 emergency response shields. \nInitiatives by school leaders that Michael is proud to see. \n\"I've been going to schools here fourteen years and I just know that these are people who listen and care,\" said Mareno. \nAnd initiatives that hopefully will keep the next generations of Seahawks safe long after Michael graduates this spring.

      "text": "About EnviroLink Friday, 23 March 2018 You   EPA decision to pave way for changes in fuel efficiency rules: sources EPA decision to pave way for changes in fuel efficiency rules: sources Posted on by EnviroLink Editor | 0 Comments WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Administration plans to declare by April 1 that the Obama administration’s vehicle efficiency rules through 2025 are “not appropriate,” two officials briefed on the matter said Friday. FILE PHOTO – An exhaust pipe of a car is pictured on a street in a Berlin, Germany, February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch The “not appropriate” declaration will allow the Trump administration to reopen vehicle emissions rules announced in 2011 and agreed to by automakers. The administration is considering significant changes that would make it easier for automakers to meet regulations, a move that could boost vehicle pollution. The EPA is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but not immediately propose new requirements, the people said. The rules sought to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing revisions for automakers remained in flux. EPA officials suggested a proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman confirmed in an email Friday that a draft determination submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget “is undergoing interagency review. A final determination will be signed by April 1, 2018, consistent with the original timeline.” She declined to offer any details on the proposal. Heidi King, the deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator, told a Senate panel Tuesday that the agency expected to propose fuel economy standards in April for a five-year period and is working “to make sure that the federal family is aligned in the path forward.” Car companies hope to avoid a potential legal battle among federal regulators, many state attorneys general and environmental groups that could leave them in limbo about future rules. General Motors Co ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Mary Barra met earlier this month with EPA and Transportation officials. Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011. In March 2017, Trump suggested he would soften the mandates. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he told autoworkers. Automakers are pressing the administration to reach agreement with California to maintain a nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered. A spokeswoman for Nichols, Stanley Young, said the agency was “troubled about the rumors that the EPA has found the standards to be too aggressive and that they need to be weakened.” He added California feels “strongly that weakening the program will waste fuel, increase emissions, and cost consumers more money.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",

      "text": "Back this project About \nFresh off the blocks from its sell-out run in Berlin. No Way Out is heading to Camden People's Theatre in London in May. We need a bit more help to get it, and our international cast there. \nNo Way Out is a devised theatre piece that challenges female stereotypes established in classic and modern literature and media. Three characters are locked-in a toilet, an accidental purgatory where they revise their situations, themselves and ultimately their fate; figuring out what it really is to be a woman. Rehearsal shots - Eva Nalbach \nNo Way Out asks performers and audiences what it is to be female and the gap between reality and representation. A reinterpretation of classical texts and characters; interwoven with personal analysis and experiences giving classical personages a contemporary voice. Placed side-by-side, irrespective of their narrative or historical context, each character attempts to re-write or at least re-experience their penned fate, offering a different perspective to the stories we know. \nCreated by an international ensemble, structurally influenced by Huis Clos (Sartre), Six Characters in Search of an Author (Pirandello), Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Stoppard); adapting texts from, Don Quixote, Joan of Arc, the myth of Shahmaran and inspired by fairy tales, myths, Disney princesses, contemporary female figures and pop queens. Production shots \nWe have been developing the show in the UK and Germany and are heading to the UK in May to perform at Camden People's Theatre. We need a little bit of extra help to fund flights, accommodation and costs. \n(picture credits: Hugo Reis, Eva Nalbach and Federico Boccardi, respectively) Risks and challenges \nThis is an exciting and adventurous theatre project that requires energy and planning to get it on the road. Flight is a company with experience of making new works for local and international audiences and although this project offers some logistical challenges we are confident that our skilled team and the support offered by partner venues will ensure that this project is well managed.

      "text": "world soccer 24.3.2018 12:40 am Mueller super strike earns Germany draw with Spain by Ryland JAMES/AFP Great leveller: Thomas Mueller equalises for Germany in the 1-1 draw with Spain A superb Thomas Mueller equaliser saw world champions Germany fight back against Spain as the European powerhouses drew 1-1 in Friday’s high-profile friendly. \nAfter Rodrigo Moreno put Spain ahead after just six minutes, Germany went into the break level as Mueller hit his 38th goal for the national team on his 90th international appearance. \n“I had tried it two or three times in the warm-up and it’s nice when you can pull it off in the game,” Mueller told broadcaster ARD. \n“Both teams had their chances and it could have just as easily finished 2-2 or 3-3 — it was a good test for both of us.” \nThe draw in front of a sold-out 50,653 crowd preserves both sides’ respective unbeaten runs dating back to Euro 2016. \nSpain, who host Argentina on Tuesday in Madrid, are now 17 games unbeaten while Germany’s run is 22 without defeat as they prepare to play Brazil in Berlin, also on Tuesday. \nSpain coach Julen Lopetegui included three veterans who won the 2010 World Cup in Gerard Pique, Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta. \nAt 33, Iniesta gave the Germany midfield a masterclass during the first 45 minutes, moving the ball at ease with silky passes at the heart of Spain’s attack. \nGermany boss Joachim Loew started with six World Cup winners from 2014 in Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mueller and Mesut Ozil. \nGermany were punished for living dangerously as Spain dominated the early exchanges. \nHummels was at fault for the opening goal, leaving too much space for Iniesta to tuck the ball behind the German defence. \nMoreno snapped up his chance to beat Germany goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen on six minutes. \nIt should have been 2-0 to Spain on 18 minutes when Isco’s pass to David Silva was just a fraction too heavy and Ter Stegen had enough time to smoother the attack. \nIt took a superb piece of skill for Germany to draw level on 35 minutes. \nMueller spotted Spain goalkeeper David de Gea off his line and unleashed a superb strike which hit the top left-hand corner from 20 yards out. \nAt half-time, Atletico Madrid’s Saul Niguez came on for Iniesta in the Spanish midfield. \nRight at the start of the second half, Germany winger Julian Draxler came within a whisker of putting the hosts ahead. \nHis fierce shot from outside the area was pushed around the post by De Gea’s fantastic save. \nOzil then failed to connect after being put in a great position by Timo Werner. \nA knock to Khedira saw Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundogan come on into Germany’s midfield and the game opened up approaching the hour mark. \nOnly a great Ter Stegen save denied Isco, but the Germans counter-attacked immediately and De Gea had to palm away a shot by Gundogan. \nHummels hit the crossbar on 65 minutes with a header after Toni Kroos floated a free-kick over Spain’s wall. \nBoth sides had late chances to steal the win, but a flurry of changes by both coaches meant the game’s tempo dropped for the final quarter of an hour.

      "text": "CHRONOLOGY Deadly terrorist attacks in France since 2015 Europe By our dpa-correspondent and Berlin (dpa) - More than 240 people have been killed in Islamist extremist attacks in France since 2015.Many of them - like Friday‘s attack in the south of the country - have been claimed by the Islamic State organization, although the extent of its actual involvement has not always been clear.Here is a chronology of the fatal attacks since January 2015, when gunmen attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket in Paris. Police say they have foiled many more attempts.March 23, 2018: At least three people are killed in the southern towns of Carcassonne and Trebes when a man known to police as a petty drug dealer attacks first the driver and passenger in a car, then a police patrol, and finally shoppers in a supermarket, where he also takes hostages. He is shot dead by police after a siege.October 2017: Two young women are killed in a knife attack at the main railway station in Marseille. Eyewitnesses say the killer shouted \"God is great\" in Arabic. He is shot dead by police.April 2017: A gunman shoots a policeman dead on the Champs-Elysees. He also injures two officers and a German tourist before being shot dead by police.July 2016: Two assailants, claiming to be members of the Islamic State extremist group, kill an 84-year-old priest in a church in northern France and are killed by police as they leave the church.July 2016: 86 people are killed and many are wounded when an attacker drives a truck into a crowd of Bastille Day revellers.June 2016: A police commander and his female companion are killed in their home by a man who then posts a live Facebook video pledging allegiance to Islamic State.November 2015: Islamic State extremists kill 130 people in Paris in coordinated attacks at the Bataclan concert hall and nearby bars and restaurants. In addition, three terrorists blow themselves up outside the Stade de France during a football friendly between France and Germany, killing themselves and a bus driver.June 2015: A chemical plant in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, south-eastern France, is attacked by suspected Islamists and one man is beheaded, two wounded.January 2015: Twelve people die during an attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. The two gunmen - brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi - die two days later after police surround their hideout north-east of Paris.At about the same time, Amedy Coulibaly, an Islamist and acquaintance of the brothers, shoots a policewoman in the south of Paris before taking hostages in a Jewish supermarket in the city. Four people are killed before police take Coulibaly down.",

      "text": "Loew set to play strong hand against Spain Source: AFP | 00:01 UTC+8 March 23,   \nJOACHIM Loew is keeping his World Cup cards up his sleeve, but the Germany coach is set to play a strong hand in today’s mouth-watering international friendly against Spain. \nThe defending champion begins to finetune its World Cup preparations with high-profile home friendlies against Spain, in Duesseldorf, and Brazil, in Berlin next Tuesday. \nLoew revealed yesterday that World Cup winners Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Thomas Mueller, Mesut Ozil and Toni Kroos will all face Spain in a strong line-up, although Liverpool midfielder Emre Can is missing after picking up a back injury while on club duty. \nThe biggest absence will be captain Manuel Neuer, recovering from a fractured foot, while Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will start in goal. \nThere are just three months before the World Cup kicks off in Russia, and while Loew expects both teams to impress today he also knows neither will be keen to put all its wares on display. \n“It will be a game in which both teams will want to show what they can do,” said Loew. “However, neither will want to lay their cards on the table. \n“If we were to play Spain at the World Cup, it would be a very different game and we know they are a top team in every respect. Their best 11 to 13 players come from Atletico, Barca and Real, uniting all these virtues. \n“You have Atletico’s pressing game, Real’s high speed and quick counter-attack with Barca’s possession. \n“That unites the national team and for me, they are one of the top favorites.” \nGermany qualified for the World Cup with a perfect record of ten wins. \nSpain, under head coach Julen Lopetegui, won nine and drew the other with stars Diego Costa, Isco, Alvaro Morata and David Silva each scoring five goals in qualifiers. \nThe Spanish have also set up high-profile friendlies this month and host Argentina in Madrid next Tuesday. \nThe 2010 World Cup winner is unbeaten since Lopetegui took over after Euro 2016, while Germany is on a 21-match unbeaten run. \nMorata, plus his Chelsea teammates midfielder Cesc Fabregas and striker Pedro were left out for the Germany and Argentina friendlies by Lopetegui. \nGermany’s Kroos could face Real Madrid midfield teammates Isco and Marco Asensio in Duesseldorf and is relishing the prospect. \n“Spain is a special game and a few of my Real teammates will be involved,” said Kroos, who left Bayern Munich for Madrid in 2014. \n“We talked about the game in advance, but nothing more. \n“We’ll need to play well, Spain stands for a certain type of football — a mix of Real and Barca. \n“They have lost some players, but brought in others and they are back at the top level. \n“I see that every weekend in the (Spanish) league and they are clearly among the World Cup favorites.”",

      "text": "Neuer clock ticking as World Cup looms Source: AFP | 00:01 UTC+8 March 22,   \nTHE clock is ticking down for Manuel Neuer to return from a fractured foot, but the Germany camp is hopeful he will be ready for its World Cup defense. \nGermany hosts Spain tomorrow in Duesseldorf and Brazil in Berlin next Tuesday in high-profile friendlies, but will again be without its captain and goalkeeper. \nIn the 31-year-old’s absence, Barcelona’s Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Kevin Trapp of Paris Saint-Germain and Bayer Leverkusen’s Bernd Leno will be vying for Germany’s No. 1 shirt. \nNeuer has not played since fracturing his foot last September — the second time he suffered the same injury in 2017. His club Bayern Munich has not set a date for his return, but the countdown is on before Germany announces its World Cup squad on May 15. \n“There is no pressure from our side, it’s a decision for him and the doctors,” said Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff yesterday. “Of course, we hope he will be 100 percent ready and fit by the time we nominate (the World Cup squad).” \nNeuer has not played for Germany since October 2016, and the defending world champion is desperate for him to be ready for its opening World Cup match against Mexico in Moscow on June 17. \nNeuer was voted the world’s best goalkeeper for four years running up until 2016. His six-month absence and lack of match practice is a cause for worry in football-mad Germany. \nThomas Mueller understands the concern but is backing his Germany and Bayern teammate to get fit. \n“I see ‘Manu’ a bit more than most and he always give the impression that everything is okay,” said the midfielder. \n“I am not privy to what the medical situation is, but I haven’t heard anything to suggest things aren’t going to plan. \n“He’ll take the necessary time, and from what I know of ‘Manu’, you can never write him off. \n“The discussion as to whether Neuer will be fit for the World Cup is understandable, but I think he’ll manage it.” \nThe Spain and Brazil games are Germany’s final international friendlies before the World Cup squad is picked, but warm-up matches are planned against Austria and Saudi Arabia on June 2 and 8, respectively. \nFour years ago, a shoulder injury also hampered Neuer’s preparation before the last World Cup. But Bierhoff admits the long absence this time around is new territory for Neuer. \n“I don’t see it as a problem, the work-load on his foot will be gradually built up,” said Bierhoff. “What is different from 2014, of course, is a lack of match practice. \n“But I still think that during intense training sessions, a world-class goalkeeper comes relatively quickly back into his rhythm.”",

      "title": "Berlin Just Canceled Its Airbnb Ban",
      "text": "Print \nBerlin’s “Airbnb ban” is over. \nThe city’s assembly decided Thursday to overturn a law introduced in April 2016 that barred almost all landlords from letting their apartments to short-term visitors, enforced by a maximum €100,000 ($123,000) fine. Thursday’s ruling means that, starting May 1, owner-occupiers will, under certain conditions, be allowed once more to rent out their own home as much as they want, and to rent out second homes for up to 90 days a year. For a city that’s become well-known for its extremely tough laws governing vacation rentals, the new ruling might seem like a major compromise. \nIt nonetheless imposes some pretty firm conditions on vacation rentals and makes the penalties for ignoring them far more stringent. All landlords seeking to rent out their home will only be allowed to do so if they get a general permit from their borough, even if they intend only to rent their property out for occasional short stays. While landlords applying for a permit at their primary residency will likely be approved, second home owners may face a more rigorous process. Landlords who leave an apartment untenanted, meanwhile, will need a special permit from the borough to do so after three months of vacancy without having a permanent tenant registered, cutting the current vacancy grace period in half. Most strikingly, the maximum penalty for breaking the rules has been multiplied by five, to a potential fine of €500,000 ($617,000). \nThat fine is likely intended as a menacing message to anyone tempted to reserve an apartment as a full-time vacation let, rather than a levy authorities will impose regularly. But it’s clear the city means business: Under the new rules, if a landlord needs to sell their property to pay a fine, the property’s management would be handed over to a trustee. Overall, the ruling is still a relaxation of the current situation, and it’s likely to induce a sigh of relief for Airbnb and other hosting services. \nFor some time now, the Berlin boroughs that attempted to clamp down on vacation rentals have only been able to pursue proceedings against a small portion of the very large number of people offering accommodation. Frequently these cases have been bogged down in appeals from owner-occupiers, making the process long-winded and expensive. There’s also a good reason to put quotation marks around the term “Airbnb ban.”Any quick scan of Airbnb in recent years would have revealed a significant number of apartments in Berlin during the time they were supposedly banned. Clearly Airbnb landlords—both owner-occupiers and tenants subletting on the sly—felt a degree of safety in numbers, well aware that chasing every single case would be long-winded and expensive for the authorities.

      "text": "11 hours ago The auteur and Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura on their latest, and maybe best, film. \nIt’s the day after the premiere of Isle of Dogs, and the Hotel Adlon in Berlin is overrun with the people who made it. Jeff Goldblum is appearing and reappearing in increasingly garish shirts. Bill Murray is talking about the arduousness of this press trip with the wild coif of a man who hasn’t gotten much post–premiere party sleep. Bob Balaban is sarcastically describing his shoes as “vintage.” People keep crossing paths as they make their way in and out of the GQ photo shoot and the rest of their obligations at the Berlin Film Festival, familially bumping each other and continuing on to their next tasks like extremely glamorous ants. Bryan Cranston needs to duck next door to be photographed with the puppet for his character, Chief, surprisingly heavy from the fully articulated metal dog skeleton beneath its matted fur. Greta Gerwig is en route to the BAFTAs, where her film Lady Bird is up for a bunch of awards. And lucky Tilda Swinton is getting ready to hop on a train to Zurich with the man who brought everyone here: Wes Anderson . But before that happens, the most meticulous auteur in cinema needs to sit down with co-creators Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Kunichi Nomura to discuss Isle of Dogs, his most ambitious film yet. \nGQ : Your live-action work can have the feeling of being autobiographical—like, you’re from Texas, and Bottle Rocket and Rushmore were filmed or set there. But I wonder if it’s actually more personal to do something that’s wholly from your brain, like Isle of Dogs, rather than re-creating or evoking things that really happened to you. \nWes Anderson: When Jason and I did Rushmore together, the setting was my [alma mater, St. John's School in Houston], and it's very close-to-home kind of stuff. But over the years, it's sort of like the story kind of takes you where it takes you. \nRoman Coppola: What came into my mind is that oftentimes, when we're beginning, we'll say, \"Do you ever have this kind of experience or that kind of experience?\" I guess we don't see it as making this thing that's a flight of fancy from your imagination, but as rather personal. \nBut Wes, when you're asked, \"What does this clearly autobiographical detail from one of your films mean about your life?\" you respond with something like, \"Well, just because Anjelica Huston had the same profession as my mother and wore my mother's actual glasses in The Royal Tenenbaums —\" \nAnderson: \"Doesn't mean she's my mother.\" \nYeah. And it reminded me of Jason Schwartzman's character in The Darjeeling Limited, where he keeps, obviously somewhat untruthfully, insisting— \nAnderson: \"The characters are all fictional.\" Yes. \nI feel like Isle of Dogs is maybe the first movie where no one's going to be like, \"Was that your dog? What does this say about you, Wes?\" \nAnderson: Yes. Well, I actually did have a dog named Chief. A black dog named Chief. [ Jason Schwartzman enters and, despite the ample seating available, sits cross-legged on the floor. ] I'm sure there are lots of characters that draw something from our own experience, but I think you're right. There's not any character in Isle of Dogs who you could say, \"This one is this person\" or something like that. \nBut I'm not sure. In Moonrise Kingdom , which Roman and I worked on together, I'm not sure who is from [real life]—I mean, Suzy Bishop is the name of a girl I knew in the second grade. And Sammy Shakusky is real. He was a kid who was younger than I was, but in our carpool. \nA bit of an odd bird? \nAnderson: He was odd. But my recollection of Sammy Shakusky is very blurry and faint and distant. Like, I probably knew him when he was five. \nCoppola: In Moonrise Kingdom, there was kind of a fantasy element of recalling when you were 11 or 12 and how you felt and what you wished would have happened rather than what actually happened. But it's true— Isle of Dogs is a little more fanciful and not so, so, so many elements that I can think of are linked to experience. \nAnderson: In Moonrise Kingdom, we didn't say [the way we had to with Isle of Dogs ], \"Where does the government convene?\" We didn't have a police force to invent. \nCoppola: But we did have the sheriff. \nAnderson: Yeah, we had Bruce Willis. \n\"So often in movies, the tradition is just to work and then separate between takes or between days. You just don't even get to know anybody, which is the whole joy of it.\" \nYour movies all do have this quality of invented realism, where you're making something that's not faithful to reality but feels realer than the real thing. The Royal Tenenbaums is more New York than New York. Moonrise Kingdom is more island town than an island town, or more Boy Scouts than the Boy Scouts. \nJason Schwartzman: A bit exaggerated, probably. \nIt's like re-creating your memory of something, rather than doing the research, almost makes it more vivid. \nSchwartzman: Have you seen the app where they were taking kids' drawings and animate them? Or heard of the fantastic organization Story Parts? \nIs that when a kid writes a play and adults come and act it out with great seriousness? \nSchwartzman: Yeah! \nThat's exactly how Wes's movies feel. You know, it's so nice to have all four of you here, because so many of the films are about groups of people—the Boy Scouts or a family or a ship's crew or, in the case of Isle of Dogs, a dog pack. You seem to be a pack creature in real life, Wes. \nAnderson: I don't even know if I am. I tend to often just stay home. Making Isle of Dogs , I worked mostly from my computer, usually alone. Sometimes I would have my editor or a music editor or someone work with me. I went off to work with the composer [Alexandre Desplat]. I sometimes had to go to the studio. But really, I'm kind of usually on my own. Watch Bill Hader Remembers the Time He Met Tom Cruise \nEvery time I've heard you talk about working alone, you've described it as torturous. \nAnderson: Well, writing alone is very challenging for me. Sometimes I am working on the script alone, but with the Moonrise Kingdom script, I had started on my own and was really stuck. I asked Roman to help me because of two things. First, Roman is very analytical. He just has a very quick read and then usually a menu of ideas. And when we are all together working, it keeps me in the game. It keeps us focused or something. \nCoppola: You said \"pack animal.\" Wes will often get a house. Like in Görlitz [where The Grand Budapest Hotel was shot], we all took over a hotel and had a chef. \nAnderson: We were at the Hotel Versa. \nCoppola: There's a—I don't want to say instinct, but a pleasure taken in having a group of people. Being on this trip [to the Berlin Film Festival] and seeing Jeff Goldblum and Bill Murray and everyone gathered, there is a nice camaraderie. \nSchwartzman: Wes goes through a great effort. So often in movies, the tradition is just to work and then separate between takes or between days. You just don't even get to know anybody, which is the whole joy of it. I remember the first movie, Rushmore , working together and how great it was. We all lived down the hall from each other. When I worked after that, I felt such a vacancy. \nAnd [on Grand Budapest ], Wes got that little hotel in Görlitz instead of having all of these people staying in apartments or however a traditional movie would do it. The actors get to know each other. You're sort of living in the world of the movie as a unit. \nAnderson: I think all that stuff came from when we were doing Darjeeling Limited . Roman had some particular ideas at the beginning, like no makeup department—it should be like the theater, where the actors do their own makeup. We tried to do that, but we didn't entirely because some people want makeup. \nCoppola: We wired mics into the clothing. \nSchwartzman: We had to be somewhat responsible for our own continuity. Like, \"Adrien [Brody], your glasses were on your head in this scene.\" \nAnderson: Also we started doing the thing where your costume is in your room. It's been pressed overnight, and when you wake up, it's there. You get dressed into your clothes and go to the set in character. You don't have a trailer. You don't have any place to go before. You just go straight to the set and you stay there. That was a good thing we started doing then, which we still do. \nSchwartzman: For my brain, it's the best, because you don't have to force yourself to be focused. He creates the whole environment. \nJeff Goldblum had a really beautiful line about this. He said, \"The communal enjoyment of all these actors and artisans is an art piece in itself.\" \nSchwartzman: Well, I guess that's basically what I said, but in one sentence. \nWes, you said everybody keeps you going and you're in it together, but what are the rest of your roles in this little group? \nCoppola: I like to be the control tower whenever possible. We just learned this term recently. When Kurosawa did his writing, there'd be a group of people, and some people would be concerned with the dialogue, and others idea generation. And one of the writers was called the control tower, who would kind of vet ideas or guide it and shape it as you tried to get it past him. \nAnderson: Redirect. \nCoppola: Yeah, kind of redirect some straight ideas. \nAnderson: But I feel like we don't really have different roles; we just work together. I mean, in Isle of Dogs we have a different thing. When Kun became a part of it, suddenly we had one person among the four who actually speaks the language [Japanese] that half of the movie is going to be in. \nNo pressure. \nNomura: It was really a burden in a way. Because if I explained, \"This is how it should be,\" the only thing he could say was, \"Okay, I trust you.\" Maybe if I said it in English, he would say, \"I've got to talk to Jason or Roman. Kun, you are wrong.\" But this one, he can't do that. I'm the only Japanese [person] he would communicate to, so I had to double-check everything. \nAnderson: He told me as soon as he read the first pass [on Isle of Dogs 's screenplay], \"This is a perfectly reasonable translation, but it does not sound like your work.\" And so at a certain point, I only trust Kun to really know what's right for us. But I never felt like, \"Oh, I'm uncomfortable with him having this power.\" I mean, Kun directed a lot of the performances that are in Japanese. \nNomura: Wes doesn't understand what they are actually saying. \nAnderson: It could be a whole different movie! \nNomura: I was really worried. \nSchwartzman: Is this a cry for help? \nNomura: No, it's not. But when somebody really trusts you, you want to pay them back for that trust. \nAnderson: You want to get it right. [But] don't worry. GET THE",

      "text": "Editor’s note: To listen click here 5:06 David Brancaccio \nNote that when the White House hit China yesterday with as much as $60 billion in trade sanctions, at the same time the United States said the recent steel and aluminum tariffs will not apply to some allies – including the the European Union and Brazil. \nSecuring ad hoc custom deals on trade has a retro, Cold-War feel to some. In Berlin, Stephan Richter is editor-in-chief of the online publication The Globalist, and he has a reminder that something called COMECON was more than just a comic book trade show. Hi Stephan. 5:36 Stephan Richter \nHi David. 5:38 David Brancaccio \nAlright, so one terms bilateral two countries working out their trade rules. But you think there is a kind of “Back to the Future” aspect to this? 5:45 Stephan Richter \nWell it’s back to the past, of course. This is almost Old Testament. It’s called the COMECON. Few people will remember, but it was a very powerful economic organization that the Soviet Union set up, the so-called Council for Mutual Economic Assistance where the Soviets called all the shots on all the product flows. Everything was bilateral. \nAnd if you were Cuba you were told to deliver 90% of your grapefruit production to Moscow, and for that you got maybe some trucks out of East German production or something. \nBut we know that the Soviet Union collapsed, and one big part was that it was never productive in terms of export goods and all the like. So it’s really something one shouldn’t go to, but Donald Trump seems to be hell-bent on going there and that’s a worry for people all over the world. 6:38 David Brancaccio \nAlright, but these are not vassal countries the United States wants to deal with. There has to be some level of two-way street, an actual negotiation. 6:46 Stephan Richter \nCorrect. And the big hope right now is, that with regard to China, if after the overture with aluminum and steel they focused on finding smart ways to tell the Chinese we live in a global market and they need to keep up their side of the bargain. Then it would all of a sudden turn into a big hooray for Donald Trump. 7:07 David Brancaccio \nStephan Richter, editor-in-chief of The Globalist. He’s in Berlin. Stephan — always good to talk to you. 7:11 Stephan Richter \nSame here. Bye \nEditor’s note: Read Stephan Richter’s article How Trump’s Trade Policy Resurrects COMECON, US-Style More on this topic",

      "text": "Prime office rents on the rise Eurobuild CEE 23 March 2018 Author articles \nEUROPE European prime office rents saw an average y-o-y rental increase of 6 pct in 2017, their fifth consecutive year of growth and they show no sign of abating for at least another three years, claims Savills. \nThere are now a number of European cities where prime office rents are considerably higher than the pre financial crisis peak in 2007. These include: Stockholm (+49 pct), Berlin (35 pct), Oslo (26 pct) Munich (16 pct) and London WE (14 pct). “The economy in these markets has gone from recovery to rapid expansion and with strong GDP growth forecast for the next few years, continued business expansion will sustain positive rental growth across Europe’s CBDs,” says Matthew Fitzgerald, the director of European tenant representation at Savills. \nAccording to Savills’ analyses the overall amount of space in the pipeline for 2018 -2019 across Europe’s CBDs is around 10.5 mln sqm and this corresponds to about one year’s take-up, based on the long term average. As it should take some time before demand and supply rebalance, upward pressure on prime CBD rents will be sustained and for 2018, Savills forecasts an annual average increase of 2.5 pct. Notably Oslo, Madrid, Barcelona and Copenhagen are likely to encounter annual rental growth of over 4 pct and there is speculation about how high rents can go in some of these markets. \n\"The availability of office space has also decreased in Warsaw. Considering the relatively low levels of new supply projected for 2018 and 2019 and the high levels of tenant activity that can be seen both in the gross take-up and the record high level of net absorption, further decreases in the vacancy rate are to be expected with a small increase in rents,” says Wioleta Wojtczak, an associate director in the research department at Savills.",

      "text": "IN the group of social entrepreneurship start-ups “Labayh” from Madinah and in the group of tech innovation start-ups “Lucidya” from Jeddah were the winners in the First German-Saudi start-up competition in Riyadh\nTen start-ups from all over the Kingdom competed for a four-day start-up tour to Germany. The competition at the Rosh Rayhaan Hotel here on Thursday was organized by the German-Saudi Arabian Liaison Office for Economic Affairs (GESALO) and was attended by Princess Johara Bint Talal as guest of honor.\nDetecon Al-Saudia (DETASAD), an end-to-end ICT solution provider and a leading contributor of ICT sector of Saudi Arabia for more than 35 years, sponsored the 1st German-Saudi Startup Competition organized by GESALO. This event gave Saudi entrepreneurs the opportunity to pitch their business models to a jury. The winners will then represent their company at the MENA Business Forum in Berlin during a four-day startup tour in Germany. This will allow them to network with leading investors, potential partners, and other stakeholders in the startup ecosystem.\nIn his welcoming remarks, the delegate of German Industry and Commerce for Saudi-Arabia, Bahrain and Yemen, Oliver Oehms, explained, “Today is about start-ups and entrepreneurship and we will bring the two winning start-ups to Berlin to showcase promising Saudi start-ups at a very interesting conference, the MENA Business Forum. Small and medium-sized companies and innovative business ideas are the key drivers of the German economy and a growing sector in Saudi Arabia.”\nAmbassador Dieter Haller commended the guest of honor for giving a wonderful example for Saudi entrepreneurs and for helping to empower Saudi women. Regarding the start-up competition he went on: “The Saudi start-up is as vital and dynamic as any other segment of the Saudi society. We have thought that we should bring the Saudi and the German start-up scene together and one of the most fertile places for start-ups is Berlin. I am so happy that the two winning start-ups will be invited to this important conference in Berlin. My hope is that we will establish a continuous platform for the exchange of ideas and best practices between German start-ups and Saudi start-ups.”\nFollowing the official opening, the ten finalists from Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, Taif and Madinah competed in two groups. They had two minutes to pitch their business ideas in front of the German-Saudi business community and a high-ranking jury, which had another two minutes for follow-up questions.\nIn the group of social entrepreneurship start-ups the winner was “Labayh” from Madinah. The project helps individuals who are suffering from family and psychological problems by useful free content and providing consultation sessions through a mobile app, which works as a point of connection between consultants and users.\nIn the group of tech innovation start-ups the winner was “Lucidya” from Jeddah. The company aims at empowering businesses in order to make smarter decisions by using artificial intelligence and big data technologies, so that they monitor and analyze all forms of digital media to understand and predict consumers’ thoughts.\nThe two winners will travel to Germany from April 11 to 14 and get the chance to pitch at the Mena Business Forum on April 12. Before and after the event, an exciting dive into the vibrant start-up ecosystem in Berlin awaits the entrepreneurs including individual meetings with successful German founders, investors, and experts.\nMeanwhile, Felix Wass, president and CEO of Detecon Al Saudia, said, “We’re proud of our leadership position within the high technology space, and delighted to work together with the German Embassy, GESALO, and our partners to support development & building of a vibrant start-up ecosystem in the KSA ICT industry.”\nHe added: “Sponsoring this competition as an official partner of the German-Saudi Liaison Office for Economic Affairs (GESALO), is consistent with our corporate mission and is squarely within our vision of fostering creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. DETASAD as a prime example of successful Saudi-German partnership with a track record of 36 years in ICT industry is committed to being a key contributor to the realization of Saudi Vision 2030.\n“DETASAD is committed to supporting the Saudi youth start-up entrepreneurs and we believe in the Saudi youth’s high capabilities in ICT industry. DETASAD is not only sponsoring this event but will provide access to DETASAD cloud, other facilities as well as providing other logistical support to selected technology start-ups,” Wass said.\nDETASAD, established in 1982 as a Saudi-German Company, and drawing on the technology leadership of Detecon International, a member of Deutsche Telekom Group, offers tailor-made solutions in Corporate Networks & Connectivity Solutions, ICT deployment solutions, managed services, data center and cloud solutions to corporate and governmental clients and is committed to contributing to the realization of Saudi Vision 2030. — SG",

      "text": "SoccerNews in General Soccer News 23 Mar 2018 6 Views 0 Comments \nTite feels facing Germany in an international friendly will be important emotionally for his Brazil side, four years on from World Cup humiliation. \nGermany destroyed the hosts 7-1 in the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup, plunging Brazil into a state of national despair. \nBrazil travel to Berlin on Tuesday to take on Germany for the first time since that game, Joachim Low’s men having gone on to beat Argentina in the World Cup final. \nAnd Tite – who was not in charge of Brazil at the last World Cup – accepts his players may be affected by the memory of being thrashed by Germany. \n“The 7-1 game is the most recent game,” Tite said. “And of course we know that we’ll play Germany in Berlin, they were world champions, they beat us 7-1 and it’s a step that’s passed. \n“We are in a building period and emotionally it will be important. Against Germany, we will want to play football, to be competitive, mentally strong, and put an idea in play. We are looking to impose our way of playing.” Vamos #Gratidão @lucasfigfoto A post shared by Philippe Coutinho (@phil.coutinho) on Mar 23, 2018 at 12:40pm PDT \nTite’s side beat Russia 3-0 in Moscow on Friday as the South American side build towards Russia 2018, with goals from Miranda, Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho earning a comfortable win. \nCoutinho took a deeper role in midfield, linking play for Brazil, and Tite picked the Barcelona man out for praise after an influential display. \n“He played very well, outside, roaming, inside, he is a polite and competitive player,” Tite said. \n“Someone who can be competitive, strong, and be polite at the same time. He is our own example. \n“Sometimes people confuse that polite players aren’t competitive. He can execute another role easily.” Mais imagens da vitória da #SeleçãoBrasileira contra a Rússia! 3 0 #GigantesPorNatureza #WorldCup Foto: Lucas Figueiredo/CBF A post shared by Seleção Brasileira de Futebol (@cbf_futebol) on Mar 23, 2018 at 12:18pm PDT \nPaulinho won the penalty converted by Coutinho and wrapped up the scoring himself with a back-post header, with the Barcelona midfielder pleased with the role he is playing under Tite’s leadership. \n“Tite gives me absolute freedom to do what I have always done throughout my career,” Paulinho said. \n“We knew about the difficulties we were going to face. In the second half the Russians opened up more, there were more spaces and the chances came.”",
