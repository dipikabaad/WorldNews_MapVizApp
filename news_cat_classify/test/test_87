NO WAY OUT by Flight of the Escales
Back this project About 
Fresh off the blocks from its sell-out run in Berlin. No Way Out is heading to Camden People's Theatre in London in May. We need a bit more help to get it, and our international cast there. 
No Way Out is a devised theatre piece that challenges female stereotypes established in classic and modern literature and media. Three characters are locked-in a toilet, an accidental purgatory where they revise their situations, themselves and ultimately their fate; figuring out what it really is to be a woman.

No Way Out asks performers and audiences what it is to be female and the gap between reality and representation. A reinterpretation of classical texts and characters; interwoven with personal analysis and experiences giving classical personages a contemporary voice. Placed side-by-side, irrespective of their narrative or historical context, each character attempts to re-write or at least re-experience their penned fate, offering a different perspective to the stories we know. 
Created by an international ensemble, structurally influenced by Huis Clos (Sartre), Six Characters in Search of an Author (Pirandello), Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Stoppard); adapting texts from, Don Quixote, Joan of Arc, the myth of Shahmaran and inspired by fairy tales, myths, Disney princesses, contemporary female figures and pop queens.

We have been developing the show in the UK and Germany and are heading to the UK in May to perform at Camden People's Theatre. We need a little bit of extra help to fund flights, accommodation and costs.
