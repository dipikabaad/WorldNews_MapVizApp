This Pollution-Gobbling City Bench Can Absorb as Many Toxins as 275 Trees By - Mar 21, 2018 
This elegant park bench does not just give weary pedestrians a place to rest their feet – it also absorbs as much air pollution as 275 trees, but in a tiny fraction of space. 
The CityTree bench is the work of Green City Solutions, a Dresden-based design company that creates innovative and environmentally-friendly solutions for urban infrastructure. 
The CityTree bench harbors 1,682 pots of moss that absorb dirt, soot, and other pollutants from the air. The solar-powered technology that is built into the bench can monitor particulate matter in the surrounding air and maintain its own watering system. 
The materials used to build the bench are easily recyclable and can be assembled within a matter of hours. The surface of the bench is graffiti-proof to prevent vandalism – and it comes with built-in Wifi for the modern city goer. 
Since its creation, CityTrees have been installed in Oslo, Amsterdam, London, Berlin and Paris.
