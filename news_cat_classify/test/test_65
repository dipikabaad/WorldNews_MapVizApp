1,800 York students absent after shooting threat; 17-year-old gets felony charges in separate Snapchat threat
Suburbs Elmhurst Elmhurst high school were absent in light of a separate threat that there would be a shooting Friday March 23 at the school on St. Charles Road.
DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin and Elmhurst Police Chief Michael Ruth said the 17-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct for the Snapchat message, allegedly sent March 22. Police were informed and took her into custody that day. 
The girl appeared Friday before DuPage Judge Michael Wolfe, who ordered her held in custody. She also faces a charge of possession of marijuana. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Monday March 26. 
Berlin said it was the third time within the past month a student has been charged with making a threat against a DuPage County school, stressing that it is no joking matter. 
"My office takes any threat to the well being of our students, teachers and school personnel very seriously and will fully investigate and prosecute anyone believed responsible for threatening a school," Berlin said in a statement. 
The threat came in a week where security was increased at the high school after an adult told police a relative of his, who is a student, told him back in August there would be a shooting at York on March 23. 
Elmhurst police spoke to the student who told them a boy approached her in a school hallway and told her the shooting would take place March 23, police said. The student who spoke to police could not identify the student who allegedly made the statement. 
As a result of the information and in light of national events regarding school safety, police sent additional officers, uniformed and plainclothes, to York this week. 
Student absences were considerably higher than usual Friday, the day before spring break begins. As of 3 p.m., school personnel had tallied 1,800 absences, said Kate Allt, District 205 communications coordinator. Allt said a year ago, 650 students were reported absent on the Friday before spring break. There are 2,754 students enrolled, and an average of 125 absences each day. 
A letter from superintendent David Moyer posted Thursday on the District 205 website said inthat school would be in session Friday as a normal school day, though said all students should be prepared to show their IDs when they enter the building. 
Officials said if parents called to say their child would not be in school, it would be considered an excused absence. 
"The district respects the parents' right to decide whether or not to send their child to school on any given day and communicated that to families," Moyer said in a statement. "I personally pray for the safety of students in Elmhurst and across the country every day."
