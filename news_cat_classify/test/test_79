All-square between Germany, Spain
comment 
Germany and Spain played out a thrilling 1-1 draw in a battle of World Cup contenders in Dusseldorf on Friday. 
The visitors were ahead just six minutes in when, after some intricate build-up from Spain, Andres Iniesta played Rodrigo into the Germany area and the Valencia striker tucked his first-time shot into the back of Marc-Andr√© ter Stegen's net. 
Thomas Muller drew the Germans level before half-time, picking up a Sami Khedira square ball at the top of the Spain penalty area and lashing a knuckling, right-footed shot over the outstretched arms of David De Gea to make it 1-1. 
The second half was filled with thrilling end-to-end actions littered with near misses and great saves from keepers in both goals, but neither of the footballing powers could find the end product as the match finished in a draw. 
Germany next face Brazil in Berlin on Tuesday, while Spain host Argentina in Madrid in another battle of World Cup heavyweights.
