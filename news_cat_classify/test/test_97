EUROPE European prime office rents saw an average y-o-y rental increase of 6 pct in 2017, their fifth consecutive year of growth and they show no sign of abating for at least another three years, claims Savills. 
There are now a number of European cities where prime office rents are considerably higher than the pre financial crisis peak in 2007. These include: Stockholm (+49 pct), Berlin (35 pct), Oslo (26 pct) Munich (16 pct) and London WE (14 pct). “The economy in these markets has gone from recovery to rapid expansion and with strong GDP growth forecast for the next few years, continued business expansion will sustain positive rental growth across Europe’s CBDs,” says Matthew Fitzgerald, the director of European tenant representation at Savills. 
According to Savills’ analyses the overall amount of space in the pipeline for 2018 -2019 across Europe’s CBDs is around 10.5 mln sqm and this corresponds to about one year’s take-up, based on the long term average. As it should take some time before demand and supply rebalance, upward pressure on prime CBD rents will be sustained and for 2018, Savills forecasts an annual average increase of 2.5 pct. Notably Oslo, Madrid, Barcelona and Copenhagen are likely to encounter annual rental growth of over 4 pct and there is speculation about how high rents can go in some of these markets. 
"The availability of office space has also decreased in Warsaw. Considering the relatively low levels of new supply projected for 2018 and 2019 and the high levels of tenant activity that can be seen both in the gross take-up and the record high level of net absorption, further decreases in the vacancy rate are to be expected with a small increase in rents,” says Wioleta Wojtczak, an associate director in the research department at Savills.
