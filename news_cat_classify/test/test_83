German police arrest parents of teen migrant over her stabbing
Berlin - German police have arrested the parents of a 17-year-old Libyan girl, after the young asylum-seeker was stabbed by her own brother in her bedroom, according to local media reports.
German media said the teenage girl's 21-year-old brother had attacked her with a knife because she wanted to be separated from a Syrian man whom she had married under Islamic law.
The brother and the Syrian man are both under investigation for attempted murder over the attack on February 27, added the reports.
Jan Holzner, spokesperson for prosecutors, told Schwaebische Zeitung that investigators now believe that the parents too "participated in the act" and are accusing them of grievous bodily harm.
