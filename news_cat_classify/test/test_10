Premiere: Berlin-Based Production Duo BLYNE Recruit CHU For Melodic Jam "Don't You Ever" By Aaron Bishop for Complex UK Intern | Twitter: @amb1sh .
Mar Image via Publicist Berlin production outfit BLYNE are back with new tune "Don&apos;t You Ever", featuring the silky smooth vocals of singer CHU. With an enjoyable mix of melodic instruments and angelic singing delicately put together in its arrangement, the track consists of a soft and mellow chorus which combines naturally with the production.
Promoting self-love and embracing who you are, this song is part of a journey towards an EP that will be recorded between London and Berlin, featuring vocalists such as Novaa, L Devine and B O K E H. Speaking on the track and the decision to work with CHU, the duo told Complex: "We wanted to show the versatility of our productions. With the instrumental we had created, we needed someone who would fit perfectly with what we were trying to doâ€”CHU was that person! What she added to the track was amazing, and we hope everyone likes it."
